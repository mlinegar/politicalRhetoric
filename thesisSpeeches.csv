"1",2016-11-03,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks alongside Alicia Machado in Dade City, FL","Hillary Clinton and Alicia Machado delivered the following remarks at a speech in Dade City, Florida on November 1, 2016. ALICIA MACHADO:Oh my god. Hello Dade City! How are you? It’s a big pleasure for me and a great honor to be here with all of you. My name is Alicia Machado. Es un honor estar aquí con ustedes hoy en día. I was at home with my mom and my daughter, watching the first presidential debate when I was absolutely surprised to hear Hillary Clinton say my name. It was such an honor. During the debate, Hillary said about me, and I quote, ‘She has become a US citizen and you can bet that she is going to vote this November.’ Well, she’s right. Like — thank you! Okay, I lost my speech.Like, all of you, I’m excited to be voting in this election. And you know what? I could not be prouder to cast my first presidential vote for Hillary Clinton.Estoy muy orgullosa, muy orgullosa por votar por primera vez en este gran país y votar por Hillary Clinton. I was the first Miss Universe after Trump bought the pageant. It was such a gift and honor to represent my country Venezuela and to be Miss Universe 1996. But I was only 18 years old, a little girl with 18 years old and there was still so much that I didn’t know. Trump was overwhelming. I was scared of him. He made fun of me and I didn’t know how to respond. He told me that I looked ugly and I was massive. He even called me names. He said to me: ‘Miss Piggy, Miss Housekeeping, Miss Eating Machine.’ Soon, soon, it became a joke. Alicia Machado was the fat Miss Universe. It was really painful for me. It was cruel. For years afterwards I was sick, fighting back eating disorders.Yo solo tenía diez y ocho años. Le tenía mucho miedo. Siempre fue muy agresivo y cruel conmigo. Y constantemente se burlaba de mi, llamandome con calificativo para ser me sentir mal, para ridiculisarme delante de la gente con sus bromas de Miss Piggy y de Miss Housekeeping. Se burlama de mí, me decía que era la Miss Gorda, la Miss Fea. Eso me hizo mucho daño. Por muchos anos despues sufrí de desórdenes alimenticios y de problemas de autoestima.It’s clear, it’s really clear that he does not respect women. He just judges us on our looks. He thinks he can do whatever he wants and get away with it. Well, now I’m standing here on behalf of women and Latinos across the country. Americans who have been horrified with his dangerous ideas and vision of America. And together we are going to say loudly and clearly, ‘No Trump.’ He’s not getting away with it.Hillary has been fighting for women, children and Latinas. Just average people like me and you her entire life. When she was still a student she traveled across Texas to register Latino voters to make sure that they could make their voices heard. When she was first lady, she organized the first ever White House conference on Hispanic children. She fought for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. Those are just a few reasons why I support Hillary Clinton. She’s going to fight to fix our broken immigration system to families can stay together and everyone can take part in the American dream.That is important to me and so many other people in Florida. She’s going to make sure that women finally get equal pay for their work. And she’s going to work to make jobs better for their families so everyone can be a good worker and a good parent. I’ve been talking to voters, signing up volunteers and making calls like me can see here today, there is so much enthusiasm for Hillary across the state. So to my fellow Floridians who have the right to vote, vote early, vote today. And to all the Latinos, this is our election. This is our election Latinos. Y nuestro voto es nuestra fuerza. Es nuestro poder. Así que vamos todos, vamos todos temprano a votar. Let’s work our heart out so that we can finally say madam president, señora presidenta on November 8th. Now, it’s my really honor and my pleasure to introduce the next president of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton.HILLARY CLINTON:Hello, Dade City!I am so excited about being here. Thank you, all for this really warm, wonderful welcome. And I thank, on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us. Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election, and I am very grateful for her support. I’m also delighted that we’re joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace.I also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly. And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton [inaudible] for his pledge of allegiance. And thanks to all the elected officials here. And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!It’s almost hard to believe, isn’t it? There are only seven days left in this election.So are you ready to vote?Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days?I hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick, who’s been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families. And I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he’s never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.Now somebody asked me the other day, ‘Why do you keep coming back to Florida?’ Just look around folks. I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it’s also really important in this election. Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world. And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what’s at stake in this election. Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes.One week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States. I don’t think the choice could be any clearer. I have spent my career fighting for children and families. I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice. I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike. I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president.Now, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent. And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons.When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, ‘Well then why are we making them?’And I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president. And what he told the crowd — it was a big crowd at Kent State University — I think every voter should hear. Basically — his name was Bruce Blair — he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal. There is no veto. And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say, ‘We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.’ And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities.So when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot.So is immigration. Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working, raising their families, as he has suggested he will do? I don’t think so. I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can’t be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less. I don’t think that’s right.Now maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war. We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.Or maybe for some of you, it’s what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University. And so Trump said, ‘Well, we can’t trust him because his parents were born in Mexico.’ Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called — well, but wait a minute, — he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, ‘The definition of a racist comment.’And then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our country, simply because that family was Muslim.And then let’s not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced. Honestly if this were something new, I think we’d all be asking ourselves, ‘Well, what does he have against President Obama?’ Or what does he have against me? But this is not new. I know I’m reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans.And here’s what I want you to tell. I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan. He said, ‘Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.’ So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama – literally better than anybody, I guess. And, when you think about it, what he said at the convention, ‘I alone can fix it,’ runs counter to who we are as Americans. We work together.So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president. But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because – Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States. And during those debates, Donald always used to say, ‘What have you been doing for 30 years?’ And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out. And so I’ve been a lawyer, and I’ve been a first lady, and I’ve been a senator, and I’ve been Secretary of State, and I’ve been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I’ve been a woman.And when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he’s been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women. And, I’ve got to tell you, some of what we’ve learned – some of this stuff is very upsetting. I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we’re going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. How we’re going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university. And if you’re above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it.But I can’t just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds. This is a consequential choice, so we’ve got to talk about something that, frankly, is painful, because it matters. We can’t just wish it away. And a lot of his supporters don’t like to hear this. I don’t blame them. If I were supporting him, I wouldn’t want to hear it either, to be honest. But I’ve got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it’s not okay to insult people. It’s not okay.And look at what he does. He calls women ‘ugly,’ ‘disgusting,’ ‘nasty’ all the time. He calls women ‘pigs,’ rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10. We just heard from Alicia. She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant. Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her ‘Miss Piggy.’ He called her ‘Miss Housekeeping’ because she’s a beautiful Latina. He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise. Now, he also said, ‘This is somebody who likes to eat.’ Well, I have to say: who doesn’t like to eat? I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?But you’ve got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And, I’ll tell you who: a bully, that’s who. And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down. She knows that Donald Trump doesn’t get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends.But what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence, their sense of self-worth? If you’ve got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to.Not so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl. And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable, and I’m doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson. Because, let’s be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite – they don’t look right, they’re not thin enough, they don’t act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be. Right?And I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that’s there for her to come home from school. And sometimes, we only had a few minutes together. But before she’d run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out how was the day. We’d talk about what was on her mind. And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don’t let anybody take that away from them. And we want them to be strong, and we don’t want them to feel bad about themselves. And we’ve got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down – lifting people up and respecting women.In fact, all of us should respect each other in our country. So, when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission. I want them to know they’re love, they’re cared for, they’re respected. I want them to develop a good work ethic. I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world. But that’s what I want for every child. I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families. It will be the mission of my presidency. I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?So I know there’s work to be done. We can’t do it with just words alone. We’ve got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified. And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women. I’m not going to repeat it. But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women, mistreating women. And I have to tell you, since that tape came out, twelve women have come [inaudible] ‘What he said on that tape is what he did to me.’And then we heard his response. What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting them. He said he couldn’t possibly have said those things because the women weren’t attractive enough to assault. ‘Look at her,’ he said about one woman. ‘I don’t think so.’ About another, he said, ‘She wouldn’t be my first choice.’He’s also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed. He said he did that — he said he did that to ‘inspect’ them. That was his word – and he said, ‘I sort of get away with things like that.’ And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, ‘Yes, that’s exactly what he did to us.’ Now, as bad as that is, he didn’t just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant. He’s also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant. Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing. Some of them were just 15 years old.We cannot hide from this. We’ve got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trump’s words have shaken her to her core.For a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that’s brought back painful memories. And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it’s been shocking to see this. He tried to explain it away as ‘locker room talk,’ well, I’ll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, ‘Not in our locker rooms. That does not happen.’Well, I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.And I don’t think there’s a woman anywhere who doesn’t know what that feels like.He doesn’t look at us and see full human beings, with our dreams and purposes, our own capabilities. And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign.Well, he’s very wrong. He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country. He has shown us who he is. Let us on Tuesday show him who we are. We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said. He doesn’t believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won’t raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry. Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder.Well, I have a message for him. We’re going to fight for affordable childcare. We’re going to fight for equal pay for all people. We’re going to fight for paid family leave, we’re going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and that’s important because so many people still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid. And that’s especially true for minimum wage workers — who — two-thirds of whom are women, so we’ve got work to do my friends. I’m excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be. Because instead of Donald Trump’s dangerous and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful and unifying.But I can’t do any of this without your help. Early voting has already begun. Almost 26 millions Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida. Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together. And voting on all the issues that they care about. It may be my name and Donald’s name on the ballot but everything you care about, our security, our economy, bringing our country together, the environment, clean water and clean air!Here in Dade City, you can vote every day from now until November 5th, from 7am to 7pm.In fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes’ drive away. You can go there right after this rally and vote. Because, we need everybody to stand up in this election.And if you have a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today.Don’t wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers.Donald Trump’s strategy is pretty simple– he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting, people of color from voting, that is a lot of people. By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are.Now I know here in this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump. And here is what I want to ask you, I want you to talk with them. Ask them what they care about. Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy. Because Donald Trump’s economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250,000 a year.So there could not be, no matter what you care about, a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump, and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days.We are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls, knocking on doors, it really matters, turn out matters.Please go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved. Here is what I want to leave you with. You know, I feel like so many of you, our country is already great but we can make is greater. The main reason America is great is because America is good. We are a big hearted, generous people. Not a small minded people. We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign. But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance. For America, this is one of those make or break elections. It really is in your hands.I hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November 9th. are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us? And I hope, I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference, I want to be your partner as well as your president, I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren. That is what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America. Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!Thank you all.","Clinton Official"
"2",2016-11-01,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks in Cincinnati on gun control and national security","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 31, 2016.Thank you so much! Wow, it is great to be back in Cincinnati. What a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river. I am grateful to all of you. I am thrilled to be here with my dear friends Mark and Gabby, and with all of you, because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes.Are you ready to work hard in this election and win it? Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate? I’ve known Ted a long time. He is a champion for workers and families. He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages. And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done, breaking through the gridlock in Washington. And this is important: unlike his opponent, Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.I also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials, including my friend, the Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, from across the river in Kentucky. And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today. I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work, to do everything they can to help save lives in America.You know, as Gabby says every day when she goes out, fight, fight, fight. And fight she does. She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together – to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children, our fellow men and women, our country. And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans, including a majority of gun owners, to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures. And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner.You know, you go through life, you go through the campaigns, there are ups and there are downs. And my mother, who had a really difficult life, she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign. Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up. And throughout this campaign, I have stayed focused on one thing: you – your lives, your families, the problems that keep you up at night. Because that’s really what this election is all about. It’s not about the noise and the distractions. It’s about what kind of country we want for our kids, and what kind of president can help get us there.I have so much that I want to do with you on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America. And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election.Now, earlier today, I was up at Kent State, a great university, and I told them about some of the reasons why I think it’s really important to get everybody out to vote in this election. But I started by saying that there’s this new email story about – why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That’s a really good question. But I want you to know – look, I’ve said repeatedly I made a mistake, I’m not making any excuses, but I will tell you this. If they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers, by all means, go ahead, look at them. And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year, right? It wasn’t even a close call, and I think most people have moved on. They’re looking and focused on, okay, who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief?Did any of you see the debates? Any of you see the debates? Well, I am – I got a little bit of a chance. I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job. But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service, my plans for our country, what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do, and then weigh that against my opponent, what he’s done and said. I am running against someone who says he doesn’t understand why we can’t use nuclear weapons. He actually said, “Then why are we making them?” He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. He’s mentioned Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Now, if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas, remember this. When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn’t need to consult because, and I quote, “I have a very good brain.” He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. [Booing.] No, Donald, you don’t. And of course, the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin, and their allies.So in these last days, let’s not get distracted from the real choice in this election. Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.I have to tell you, it does not give me any pleasure saying that. It’s not a small thing. I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president, both Republicans and Democrats. And look, I’ve had my disagreements with Republicans. I might have disagreed on policies or principles, but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office. Donald Trump is different, and that’s why there is so much at stake in this election. He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges – the challenge posed by slavery – and we fought a civil war. But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together.I will tell you this. I want to bring not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents, people who vote for me and people who vote against me, together. Because I have a very different vision of America. Instead of dark and divisive, it’s hopeful and inclusive. It’s big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not putting them down. It’s a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together. And America is great because America is good. Never forget that. Yes, we have our flaws; of course, we’re only humans. But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world. So we want an America where women are respected – where our veterans are honored – where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly. And we believe in an America where marriage is a right, and discrimination is wrong. An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, and the American dream is big enough for everybody. So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher.When I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck. It was a very big crowd, and it was primarily students. And I thought to myself, well, I’m not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security. And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys. A launch officer. And he came out for me, along with now more than 30 launch officers, and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys.And even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn’t seem to bother him. “Good luck. Enjoy yourselves, folks,” is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he even knows that a single – a single – nuclear warhead can kill millions of people? That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should, and I quote, “not have his finger on the button.” And when it comes to handling a crisis, we’ve seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation – when he’s gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he’s challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protestor at a rally, when he’s confronted by his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. [Cries of “No!”] Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. I hope you’ll think about that when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world, and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren.And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America. As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns. Thousands more are injured. It’s an average of 90 people a day dying. Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes. We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. And we’ve seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men. And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others. I’ve had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement.But here’s what I want to say. If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute. This can’t go on. We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time. And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period.And look. There is a very clear difference. Donald Trump won’t stand up to the gun lobby. He’s sold out to them. In fact, the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group, more than $7 million in Ohio alone. And in return, Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obama’s actions to strengthen criminal background checks. Donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol. He’s even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms. How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?So I have stood up to the gun lobby for years, which is why they are running all of these ads against me. And I will stand up to them as president. I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because we’ve got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives.I will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you, whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people, to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. That’s how I was raised. I was raised to believe that if you work hard – and I believe in hard work – you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. And I will never ever quit on you. When I tell you I’m going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life, I don’t care what the political or other barriers are. We’re going to find a way over, under, around, or through until we get it done. I’ve been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I’m not stopping now. Remember, when our opponents go low, we go high. We’re not going to be distracted. We’re not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters. And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count.Now, the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple. They’ve announced it. Their strategy is: get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, and get people of color to stay home. It’s all part of his scorched-earth campaign, but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it. And it goes against everything we stand for. So if you’re as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run, the things he has said, insulting not just women but immigrants, Latinos, African Americans, prisoners of war, Muslims, veterans, the military – I mean, the list goes on and on. It’s almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does.So you know the best way to stop him: by showing up with the biggest turnout in history. We need more Americans to vote. And I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote because we’re already seeing record turnout. Twenty-three million people have already voted in this election. And more than one million of them are right here in Ohio. There is no doubt if we vote, we win. So, please, if you haven’t voted early, please do so. And please get your friends and your family, everybody you know to vote. Take people to vote with you. Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there.Make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun. And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because, make no mistake, whatever issue you care about – I’ve only mentioned a few tonight, but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot. Now, it may be my name and my opponent’s name, but where we stand on these issues, what we’ve done in the past, what we have said we want to do in the future, that is all on the ballot. The future of our economy is at stake, of our education system is at stake. Fighting climate change and clean, renewable-energy jobs are at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. Actually, in the end, the American dream itself is at stake. So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th. [AUDIENCE MEMBER – “Happy.”]Happy. I think that’s the right answer. But just suppose, just suppose you go to bed early. Suppose you go to bed early. Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn’t make calls or knock on doors. I want you to imagine. So you get up early on the morning of the 9th. And you log on to the news to find out, hey, what’s going on, or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio, and you hear. [AUDIENCE – “No!”]I want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because I prefer for us to be motivated by what we’re for, not what we’re against. But I also think it’s prudent to imagine what could happen if we don’t do our part. And when in the future somebody asks you, maybe your kids or your grandkids, ‘What did you do when everything was on the line?’ I want you to be able to say, ‘I voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.’Let’s go out and, in these next eight days, do everything we can to make it clear we’re going after the kind of future that includes everybody. We’re going to build this economy: new jobs, rising wages. We’re going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt. We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids. So if we build that future together, we will be able to say we were part of making sure that America’s best days are still ahead of us. And we will prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate.Thank you all.","Clinton Official"
"17",2016-08-08,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on small businesses and creating jobs in St. Petersburg, FL","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks on the first stop of her Florida Jobs tour in St. Petersburg, Florida. “Thank you so much, Mike and Leigh and everybody. I am excited about being here, and I so appreciate what Mike and Leigh took their time to tell me about. Because this company, which has grown pretty dramatically in the last four and a half years, is a great example of what it means to be a small business company that then grows and takes advantage of all the opportunities that are available.And I was grateful when I asked both of them, ‘So what would you want me to do? What worked? What didn’t?’ that they gave me a terrific point of view. And just to quickly recap, because I agree with everything they said, they got a lot of help from the SBA – twice now – but they agree with me that the SBA is just not doing enough. It’s not a – its mandate is not big enough; it doesn’t include enough continuing help and outreach so that people with good ideas like they had know where to go, kind of a one-stop shop, if you will, to get all the information that they need. And I’m going to do everything I can to expand that mandate and to provide a much better conduit, to use Mike’s term, of information coming to people starting their small businesses.The second thing they said which was exciting is that when they first opened up their very first – what do they call those big silver things? Brew-house – their very first brew-house came from China. And then they found a local company not far from here who could do exactly the same thing, so all of these other brew-houses are made right here, about four or five miles right down the street. BrewFab, right? BrewFab. So that’s another thing I’m pushing, is for companies to look to see if there aren’t American suppliers who can actually provide what they need in order to have a great partnership. And I’m thrilled that what you see here illustrates that.The third thing they told me is they had a great experience with the State Department, which I was very happy to hear, because when I was Secretary of State I really stressed exports, and you can’t do exports unless you have an active group of people who are reaching out once again, trying to come up with support for businesses.And my dad was a small businessman, a very, very small business that he started and ran, so I was particularly keen that we not just help the giant American corporations but we help the small businesses, the medium-sized businesses. And Mike told me that he had a great experience on a State Department-sponsored visit to Costa Rica, right? To Costa Rica?And that’s exactly what I want to see more of too, because you can’t just expect to compete and win in the global economy by waiting for it to come to you, and you can’t do it on your own, so it’s really important to me that the government does more to help companies like 3 Daughters get out into the world so that their products can be given an equal chance to compete and win. Because I know that if we do that, nobody can outcompete American workers and businesses. We just have to be out there doing everything possible to make it reality.And then the final thing that I picked up from talking to both of them is how committed they are to their employees, but how they could sure use some help finding out what are all of the benefits and opportunities that are available through the federal government – through the tax system, for example. How can we do a better job making sure that small companies like this have the help they need to understand everything that they have to do and cut the costs and streamline it. So, for example, they were telling me that if they could get a kind of package of help – because right now, employees spend a lot of time figuring out excise tax, which is pretty complicated, and I want to try to blow through all that, simplify it, flatten it, make it possible for companies like this to get the information.And they came up with a really good suggestion: people who register LLCs, if they’re going to have employees, they should immediately get a package of information, like here’s how you can get help understanding what you have to do to register in different jurisdictions to pay taxes in different jurisdictions and the like. As much as we can simplify and use technology to simplify, the cheaper then it will be for companies like this to be successful and to grow as quickly as this one has.So I feel like I’ve learned a lot today. I really appreciate your being so well prepared to give me these great ideas that I can then try to take and put to work on behalf of businesses like yours and businesses across the country. Because it really is true that I feel a special bond with small businesses, and I have said that I want to be a small business president because of my dad’s experience, and this is one of the big differences between me and the Republican nominee. My dad worked really hard.He ran a small print plant so that in a much lower-ceilinged, darker room, he had long tables that he would roll fabric out on and then he would take a silkscreen – and he would do all this by hand – you put the silkscreen down, you put the paint in, you take a squeegee, you go from side to side and then you pick it up and you go down all the way to the end of the long table, then you’d go to the other table, so that while this table was drying then you’d come up and if there was a two-color pattern, you’d put another silkscreen on and you’d do it all over again.So he worked really hard and made a good living for my mother, my brothers and me, and that’s why I just can’t imagine – he worked so hard – if he had delivered the finished goods to the people who had ordered them, that they would have said, ‘We’re not going to pay you.’ And that’s what Trump has done time and time again. It would be like you’d get a big order from one of his resorts or casinos. That would be pretty exciting here. And people would work really hard.And then they wouldn’t pay you. Or maybe they’d say, we’re only going to pay you 50 cents or 30 cents on the dollar. I just can’t imagine. I know what it would mean to my family, but I can’t imagine what it would mean to any family. And in fact, just recently there – most people who are in that position that I’ve met who have been stiffed by him, they were told, ‘Well, go sue us.’ Well, people can’t afford to sue somebody who hires a bunch of lawyers in order to fight back. It just doesn’t make sense.But there was a small mom-and-pop shop down in South Florida that did sue him because they had helped renovate one of his golf courses. And they knew that if they didn’t get paid, it was over for them. They couldn’t keep their doors open. So they did sue him, and they got a judgment, and then they even got attorneys’ fees. So maybe the tide is turning because I’ve met painters and plumbers and glass installers and marble installers and architects and piano companies that have been operating under a contract which then was never honored.And the most fundamental thing in our economic system is you make a contract. You make a deal with somebody. You keep your end of the bargain. They keep their end of the bargain. That’s how we do business, and that’s how we’re going to continue to grow small businesses in America. Because I think Mike told me that there are 52 employees, 18 full-time. Right?Small businesses create most of the jobs in America, two-thirds. So we can’t grow the economy if we don’t really grow small businesses. And I’m going to do everything I can in this campaign and then in the White House to be a great president for small business, and to consult people like Mike and Leigh who can give me firsthand, real information about what works and what doesn’t work so that we don’t get this big disconnect where you’re trying to do something, and it’s just not working.And the final thing that make said, which I am going to be doing everything I can, is to get health care costs down. We’ve got a lot of people who are insured now because of the Affordable Care Act, but the costs are too high. We need to get prescription drug costs down and premiums and copays and all of the costs because other companies have told me the very same thing. And so I’m going to be working hard on that as well.So again, let me thank you for having us here. I want to say hello to everybody, maybe get some pictures if you wanted to, and have a chance – if anybody has any other ideas about how we’re going to promote and grow small businesses. And again, Leigh was telling me about the meaning of the flags here as well, and I bet in a few years you’re going to have flags hanging from every part of this ceiling as a real tribute to the people who have served our country. And I greatly appreciate that as well.Thank you all very much.”","Clinton Official"
"18",2016-08-05,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on criminal justice and immigration reform in Washington D.C.","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at the National Association of Black Journalists and National Association of Hispanic Journalists’ Joint Conference in Washington, D.C“Morning! I am so pleased to be here, I want to thank you all for the invitation, for the introduction, to everyone associated with NABJ and NAHJ, I want to just mark the moment because you were created in this hotel.I don’t know if there are any original founders, but if there are could you all stand up and we could give you some recognition?I am delighted to thank you for the important work you do every day, and now more than ever we need you to keep holding leaders and candidates accountable. And in the tradition of path-breaking journalists like Ethel Payne and Ruben Salazar, we need you to make sure that America’s front pages and nightly newscasts and online information reflects the great diversity of our nation.  Someone that I had the privilege of knowing, the late, great Bob Maynard, former owner of the Oakland Tribune, once said – and I quote Bob – ‘It is in seeing ourselves whole that we can begin to see ways of working out our differences of understanding our similarities,’ and becoming a more cohesive nation.And that is what you do every day, helping us to see ourselves as whole. You help us see ourselves whole.I’m looking forward to our discussion, which I’m sure will cover a wide range of issues, but I want to take just a few minutes to focus on a challenge that doesn’t get enough attention out on the campaign trail, although I’ve been trying, and that is: how do we expand economic opportunity for African Americans and Latinos across America?And you know very well, it’s been said that when the economy catches a cold, communities of color get pneumonia. The Great Recession hit our whole country hard, but the toll was especially difficult for black and Latino families. Black wealth was cut in half. For Latinos, it dropped 66 percent. That represented decades, even generations of hard work. And during these past 18 months, people across the country have described to me how hard it’s been to get back on their feet in an economy that is still not working the way we all want to see it. And barriers of systemic racism makes that even harder.      Now I believe that President Obama does not get the credit he deserves for leading us out of the Great Recession, and I like to remind people he had nothing to do with creating it in the first place. He came into office and this worst-of-all-financial-crises-since-the-Great-Depression was handed to him. And I think if you fairly look at the record, you have to conclude that his leadership saved us from a Great Depression.So as bad as things became – 9 million jobs lost, 5 million homes lost, $13 trillion in family wealth wiped out – as bad as it was, there’s no telling how far down we would have gone without his leadership. So we are out of the ditch that we were in, and now we’ve got to do even more. We’ve got to build on the progress we’ve made. 15 million new jobs in the last seven years. 20 million people now have health insurance who did not have it before he became President.So we’ve got to have the will and the plans together to move forward. That’s why I’ve proposed a comprehensive new commitment to African American and Latino communities to make serious, sustained investments to create more good-paying jobs; to help families build and rebuild wealth; and support black- and Latino-owned small businesses. For me, these aren’t just economic issues – they’re part of the long, continuing struggle for civil rights.Rosa Parks opened up every seat on the bus. Now we’ve got to expand economic opportunity so everyone can afford the fare. And we have to make sure the bus route reaches every neighborhood, and connects families with safe, affordable housing and good jobs.Sylvia Mendez and Ruby Bridges helped desegregate our schools. Now we’ve got to help every family afford the books, computers and internet access that our kids need to learn in the 21st century.And so in my first 100 days as President, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. That includes jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small businesses, and infrastructure. If we invest in infrastructure now, we will not only create jobs today, we will lay the foundation for the jobs of the future.We’re going to also focus on creating jobs in communities where unemployment remains stubbornly high after generations of underinvestment and neglect. I’m a big fan of Congressman Jim Clyburn’s ‘10-20-30’ plan – steering 10 percent of federal investment to neighborhoods where 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 years. We need that kind of focused, targeted investment – in urban places, rural places – wherever Americans have been left out and left behind.We’re also going to invest $20 billion in creating jobs for young people. There’s a big gap here. The unemployment rate among Latino and African American youth is significantly higher than for whites. You know, it’s hard to write a resume if you have nothing to put on it. We’re going to help young people get that first job, so they can get that second job, so they can build a good solid middle-class life that will give them and their families a better future.We’re going to do more to help black and Latino entrepreneurs get access to capital, so they have a real chance at turning their ideas into thriving businesses. Now I think that’s not only good for those entrepreneurs – it’s good for their families, their workers, and their communities.Additionally, as part of our end-to-end reform of the criminal justice system, we’re going to help people succeed when they return home from jail or prison. We’re going to ban the box so they can be judged by their skills and talents, not by their past. And we will dedicate $5 billion to provide training and support to returning citizens so they can get good-paying jobs.And in my first 100 days, I’m going to introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship – that’s not only the right thing to do. Every independent analysis shows it will add hundreds of billions of dollars to our economy. It will also keep families together. We need to bring hard-working people out of the shadows. America has always been a place where people from around the world work hard and apply their talents to American growth and innovation in pursuit of their own dreams. So we’re going to do everything we can to get this done.We need to build an economy and a future that every American can be proud of and be a part of.  An economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That will be my mission as President.These are just the highlights of our plan. I hope you’ll go to my website, hillaryclinton.com to read the details, including how we’re going to pay for everything I’ve proposed.And of course I hope you’ll compare that to what my opponent is talking about.Here’s one measure that you could use for that comparison: an independent economist recently calculated that, if my agenda for jobs and growth is put into place, our economy would create at least 10.4 million jobs within four years. We actually think it could be much more than that.Now this economist also ran the numbers on Donald Trump, including his disastrous and inhumane plan to round up and deport millions of hard-working immigrants. The result, according to Mark Zandi, who was the economic advisor to John McCain during his 2008 run for the presidency, the result of Trump’s plans would be a ‘lengthy recession’ with 3.4 million jobs lost.Now of course, Trump’s problems go far beyond economics. At every turn, he stokes division and resentment. He says horrible things about one group of Americans after another.  He’s harkening back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the ugliest impulses of our society.You know the list, you’ve reported on it. He started his campaign by describing Mexican immigrants as ‘criminals’ and ‘rapists.’ He retweets white nationalists. He says a distinguished judge can’t be trusted because he is of Mexican heritage. He talks about banning Muslims from coming to the United States – a land built on religious freedom. And yes, he also talks about curtailing press freedom as well.We need to stand up as a country, and say Donald Trump doesn’t represent who we are and what we believe. That is what my campaign, what Tim Kaine and I, and everyone supporting us, is doing every day. And we’re going to keep at it. Because I believe with all my heart that America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump.We just launched an all-Spanish Twitter account, because we want to bring as many Americans as possible into this conversation. We’ve opened offices in every state, because we want to compete everywhere – we want to bring our message and our vision to all corners of our country.But we can’t do it alone. Everyone – Republican, Democrat, and independent – needs to stand up and speak out. And I think journalists have a special responsibility to our democracy in a time like this. As Ida B. Wells once said, ‘people must know before they can act, and there is no educator to compare to the press.’Many of you are showing the way. It’s a badge of honor when Jorge Ramos gets thrown out of a press conference for challenging Donald Trump. Or when another news organization gets banned for reporting what he says. As Jorge said, the best journalism happens when you take a stand, when you denounce injustice.      So I hope you’ll keep calling it like you see it. Keep holding all of us accountable. I have laid out all these plans, and I’m well aware that I have been sometimes made fun of for putting out these plans about the economy and education and gun safety measures and all the rest of it. But I have this old fashioned idea that when you run for President, you ought to tell the voters of America what you would do as President. So I am going to keep telling you what I’m going to do because I want you to hold me accountable, press and citizens alike.Because the stakes are as high as they’ve ever been in our lifetimes. And we all have to do our part.So thank you for what you do everyday, thank you for inviting me to address you today. And I look forward to taking some of your questions today. Thank you all very much.”","Clinton Official"
"19",2016-08-04,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on 100 Day Jobs Plan in Las Vegas, NV","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada. “Thank you. Thank you so much. I am so happy to be back here and to be with all of you right here at the home of IBEW Local 357. And with so many longtime friends. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Let me, in addition to thanking IBEW, let me thank all of the union members here. The Nevada State AFL-CIO. Everyone who knows what it is to work hard and deserves a chance to get ahead and stay ahead. Thank you. And particularly I want to thank Al Davis, manager and financial secretary of IBEW. And I want to thank United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 525 who assisted with parking for this event too, so thanks.Now you just heard from your longtime senator and someone who has lead the Senate in the majority and the minority with such tenacity, such focus, getting things done for the people of this state and America. There’s a lot that I really love and admire about Harry Reid. Let me just mention three of them. Number one: his wife Landra and the beautiful family that they have created together.Number two: He always tells it as he sees it. He’s not a man of many words, but when he uses them he’s very clear about what he’s trying to accomplish and why he thinks it will help people. He’s been a champion of working people and every one of the interests that stands for the kind of America that Harry and I believe in. We both feel very fortunate, and we want to make sure everybody has the same opportunities.And number three: in the Senate he was a master of getting things done from the other side, whether they wanted to do it or not. And I know how hard that was. I was in the Senate for eight years with Harry. And before that I was First Lady and watching what he did as a senator and then of course I was Secretary of State.He worked tirelessly everyday, but he also had a vision about what needed to happen. I’ll just mention one thing that he mentioned. Harry Reid is one of the leaders in America for clean renewable energy.At a time some years ago when a lot of folks didn’t really know what that meant. Harry was holding a conference every year, bringing people together to talk about how we can get more solar and wind and geothermal, how we create more jobs because of that. And I will have more to say about it, but I think the progress that you’ve made here in Nevada and the progress we’re making across America owes a great deal to the leadership of Senator Harry Reid.I also want to thank Congresswoman Dina Titus, she has been a great voice for progress in the Congress, I can’t wait to work with her. And I am thrilled at the prospect. It’s up to you my friends, but I know you’re going to do the right thing to send Catherine Cortez-Masto to the United States Senate.[…] Okay, we’ll keep talking, and we’ll, and apparently these people are here to protest Trump, because Trump and his kids have killed a lot of animals, so thank you for making that point. So let me keep going, because I want to say another word about Catherine. She will be the first Latina ever elected to the United States Senate. So here is what I hope I can do with Catherine and Dina, with Jacky and Ruben, with other members of the House and the Senate. We are going to create more good jobs with rising incomes, we are going to have the biggest investment in new jobs that we’ve had since World War II.Now how are we going to do that? Well number one, we are going to do exactly what Harry said. We are going to have an investment in infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. But it’s not only what you can see, it’s also under the ground. The water systems, the sewer systems, and yes, we need a new, modern, electric grid to be able to take and distribute all the clean renewable energy.So I’m excited about this because, as Harry just said, for every billion dollars we get 47,500 jobs, and they are mostly good union jobs with a good middle class income.We are also going to do everything we can to assist unions and everything they represent to be able to organize and bargain collectively. I am sick and tired of leaders in this country trying to bust unions like Donald Trump did here in Las Vegas.I just came from an excellent business. A business, Mojave. That’s right, Mojave Electric, right. That’s a company that understands they could do well by doing good. It’s an IBEW union shop. It has a lot of apprentices. It has benefits that are going to keep families together and keep them growing. That’s what we need more of in America, and I’m on the side of businesses and labor that work together. The other thing I saw at Mojave is that we need more skills training for more Americans, and that includes apprenticeships programs. Mojave working with the IBEW working with electrical contractors takes the time to actually train people, and I met some of those apprentices and those journeymen and women, and they are so proud of what they do. And I want more people in America to have that kind of opportunity. I’ll tell you something folks don’t know. More than half of all jobs in 2020, and that’s not long from now, will not require a four year education.So here’s how I’m fitting all the pieces together. I want to make college affordable, in fact, I want to make it debt-free. I want to help people who already have debts and the families that are burdened by those debts to be able to pay them back at a lower interest rate and have them forgiven after a certain period of time. It makes no sense to me that Donald Trump can take bankruptcy six times, get out from under his debts, and we don’t let families and students refinance their college debts. But I think it’s really important that we do more like what I saw at Mojave today. I want to give every business a $1,500 tax credit if they will train apprentices, and not for free, pay these apprentices while they’re getting trained so more people can take advantage of that opportunity.We need more technical education back into our high schools. I want us to train 50,000 high school teachers and junior high teachers in computer science so everyone single student in America has access to that kind of opportunity.And we’re going to — we’re going to, with our infrastructure program, finish the job of providing high-speed broadband Internet access to every single home and business in America. I was talking to some teachers the other day, and I love teachers, I love teachers. And I was talking to them, and they were telling me they had just done a national survey and they found that 70 percent of teachers assigned homework that required students to go use the Internet. Now I think that’s good. We want our young people to learn how to use the Internet and understand the opportunities that they could have, but here’s the rub: 5 million students in America do not have access at home to the Internet.So, the homework gets assigned and these 5 million kids, unless they’re close enough to a library they can get to, or somebody’s business, or somebody else’s home is connected somehow, they’re left out. We do not have a single person to waste in the 21st century. I want to unleash the talent and ambition of every young American. So we’re going to give more high-school kids the chance to do real work, to get credit toward graduation. We’re going to make community college free, so that high-school students and everybody else can get two-year degrees and credentials. Because already today we have a big gap — we have about a million jobs that are not being filled around America. There are jobs for machinists, and tool and dye makers, and coders and lots of other skills.We have a lot of unions that I’ve been talking to over the past year and a half who are seeing their workforce get older. Well, we can’t afford that. We need to invest in our young people and give them different paths beside four-year college to get ahead in America. That should be the basic bargain. Now –In addition to jobs from infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, I’ve seen a couple of examples of that over the last week in Ohio, Pennsylvania. I saw a small business in Denver yesterday where they’re making homemade ties and scarves. And I was real interested in that because Donald Trump said that he can’t make his suits, or his ties, or his shirts, or his furniture in the United States. Well, we just put a website, hillaryclinton.com/makeithere, and we’re telling him about 100 places where he can actually make all of those things right here in America.And then — then I have to tell you, he talks a lot about how he’s going to grow the economy. Yet, he doesn’t make things in America and just this past couple of weeks he asked for more visas to bring in foreign workers for his golf courses and his resorts. And when asked, ‘Why would you do that?’ He said, ‘Well, we can’t find workers here.’ He really thinks he’s going to get away with this. And then there’s the way that he’s treated small business. I want to be a small business president. I want to help more small businesses get started, and grow, and create jobs here in Nevada and across America.But I have now been hearing stories from so many people who did work for Donald Trump and one of his buildings, and then they wouldn’t pay him. I went to Atlantic City, and I met a number of small businesses, as well as workers, plumbers and painters, glass installers, marble installers. At one of his resorts, they finished the work, the man who sold him the pianos and installed the pianos, they finished the work, and they submitted their bill. And the Trump people said, ‘No, we’re not going to pay you.’ Not because he couldn’t, but because he wouldn’t.And then he comes back and he says, ‘Well, maybe I’ll give you 50 cents or 30 cents on the dollar.’ Now, I’ve got to tell you, I take this really personally. My father was a small businessman, and he printed fabric for drapes. That’s what he did. He had a print plant. It was a low-ceiling, dark place with two long tables and you’d roll the fabric out on it, then you would take a silk screen and you’d put it down, you’d pour the paint in, you’d take the squeegee, you’d go from left to right, then you’d lift it up and you would do it again, all the way down that table, the next table, until you finished doing it. And then my dad would load the fabric up in his car and he would drive it to who ever had ordered it. I can’t image if he had shown up at some place that Trump owned and they said, ‘Well, thanks a lot but we are not paying you.’ Actually, that happened here in Las Vegas.He refused to pay nearly $400,000 to a local Nevada drapery company which had to close its factory. Four hundred thousand dollar order for a small business is huge. And so I do, I take it personally. Small business is the backbone of our economy. That’s where most of the jobs come from. We should be honoring people who take the risk and put in the hard work and the sweat to build their small businesses.I also was disturbed when we learned some months ago that during the terrible housing crisis — and no place was affected more than right here in Clark County, was it? Nobody. And I remember because in ’08 I walked some of those streets and some of those neighborhoods and I met with people who were on the brink of or having been foreclosed. And it was heartbreaking. And we still have work to do.But what did Donald Trump say when all of this began to happen? Well he basically said, ‘Hey this is good for me. I can go buy. I can make money.’ Didn’t matter the heartbreak. 5 million homes were lost. $13 trillion in family wealth was lost, mostly homes. And what was Donald Trump doing? He was thinking about himself. So you have got to ask yourself in this campaign, do you want a president who stands for ‘You’re fired’ or one who stands for ‘You’re hired?’So the bottom line, which I think is becoming clearer everyday, is that Donald Trump is not qualified to be President, and he is temperamentally unfit to be Commander-in-Chief. I said it Thursday night at the Democratic Convention, anyone you can provoke with a tweet should not be anywhere near nuclear weapons.But I have to agree, as I usually do, with Harry. We cannot take anything, anybody, or anyplace for granted. We have work to do. And I need your help, I need you to be part of this campaign. We are going to be registering voters, if you know – that’s right, we have a young woman right there, if you’re not registered and you’re eligible as an American citizen, please go sign up. And back there as well.We are trying, across the country, to register 3 million more voters and turn them out in November. We are also going to do everything we can to reach out to our friends and our neighbors across this state and across America, answer their questions. Somebody wants to be for Trump because they’re anxious, they’re fearful, maybe they’re angry because there’s a lot to be concerned about. We need to talk. We need to talk because we don’t want you being sold the same bill of goods that the students who signed up to go to Trump University were sold.We don’t want you to be left in the same position as the retirees in Florida were that put their money up for Trump condos, and there was never any built, and they didn’t get their money back. We don’t want you to think any businessperson can get away with your doing the work and then not getting paid for it. We don’t want you to support somebody who doesn’t support American workers and American businesses, and doesn’t seem to understand we are stronger together in America.Now, I will do everything I can in this campaign to tell you what I will try to do as your President. And here’s why. You know, I’ve been talking about my plans for jobs and education and healthcare and all the rest of the agenda for some months now. And I admit, some people have made fun of that, they go ‘Oh my gosh, there she goes with another plan.’But here’s what I believe. If I’m asking you to vote for me, for president, then I want you to know what I’m going to try to do as your president starting next January 20th. And I want you to hold me accountable. I’ll be back here. And I’m going to be talking, I want to have a dialogue with the American people. Not just during the election, but afterwards and for those four years because I think there are a lot of good ideas that Americans have. That I want to hear about. And I’ll tell you something else, I want to be the president of all Americans. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, young, old, everybody in between.Because I think this election comes down to economic opportunity, national security, and American unity. And I’m going to work to make sure we pull together, we get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We keep our country safe, we work with our friends and allies, we don’t insult them, we join together to get rid of the threats that we face, and that we’re going to pull America together again. That doesn’t mean we all have to agree. No two Americans agree a hundred percent, on anything, that’s part of our DNA, right? But we’ve got to work together.That’s why I applaud and salute Harry’s years of service. He got up every day working for you, making a difference for you. And I’m going to miss not working with him directly as he gets to leave and come home to the state that he loves. But Harry, you better pick up the phone when I call, because I need your advice about how we’re going to do everything we need to. So my friends, let’s join together for these next 96 days. Let’s make sure we win Nevada and America and build the future that we all deserve. Thank you and God bless you.”","Clinton Official"
"20",2016-08-03,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on strengthening the economy and protecting public lands in Commerce City, Colorado","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at a rally in Commerce City, Colorado“It’s great to be here with your governor. I am such a fan of Governor Hickenlooper for a lot of reasons, but one of the main reasons is because he does understand how we could create more jobs, and what’s happened here in Colorado under his leadership proves that. And he has used his own experience as a small businessman who grew a business and was successful not to turn his back on what it took but to try to help more people get the tools they need to start those businesses, to grow those businesses. And what a stark contrast with Donald Trump who has spent his career stiffing small businesses, refusing to pay his bills to small businesses.And I got to tell you, I take that really personally. My father was a small businessman, I mean really small — nothing as successful as the governor’s enterprises — he printed fabrics to turn them into draperies and it was hard work. And I cannot imagine what it would have been like for my dad who stood at that long table and took a silk screen and put it down and then put paint into it, then took a squeegee and went across and then lifted it up and went down and went down over and over again and finally got the fabric printed, and then folded it up, and then loaded it into his car to take it to where it had been ordered from whether it was a restaurant, a hotel, any other business, an office building. I cannot image what that would have felt like for my father, a Navy veteran, a chief petty officer during World War II — to have done his part, to have fulfilled his contract and then be told we’re not going to pay you.Now, when I first started hearing those stories about small businesses, I thought, well, maybe it happened once or twice. But no, my friends, it happened over and over again. Donald Trump would not pay people who did work, painters and plumbers and glass installers and marble installers and architects. We now have a very long list. What kind of man does business by hurting other people? I am just so, so determined that we are not going to let him do to America what he has done to so many other people.I want to also recognize your congressman, Congressman Ed Perlmutter. Thank you, Ed, for being here. I want to thank your principal of this great high school, principal Thompson. Thank you. And I want to thank a great man from Colorado, someone I had the distinct honor of serving with in the United States Senate and then serving with in the Obama Administration, and that is Ken Salazar. I’ll tell you, you will not find a better person, someone who is always thinking about what he can do to help somebody else, and I for one am grateful for his friendship.Now, when I think about our convention last week — did any of you see it? Well, what we tried to do was to make clear that we’re not satisfied with where we are in the country, but we think we know how to make progress together. We think we can put into effect a jobs program that will create millions of new jobs with rising incomes, and here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to have the biggest infrastructure investment program since World War II. And if you look, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems, they’re all in need. They all should be repaired. We have people who are driving long distances and spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars every year because of problems with the potholes or with the lack of maintenance. We have people scared about the bridges in their counties. They don’t have much choice, but they shouldn’t have to worry about whether they can get across or not. So we’re going to make investments that will make America grow our economy, put people to work, and position us better to actually be competitive around the world. But there’s a lot of infrastructure that you can’t necessarily see that we want to work on. We need a modern electric grid that can take clean, renewable energy — and distribute it everywhere across America.And here’s the other thing we need. We need to connect every community, no matter how isolated, how rural, how inner-city poor, no matter where it is, every community needs to be connected to broadband internet access.This is a competitive issue. How are we going to help small businesses that don’t have access? When I was in Pennsylvania a few days ago and I said that, I had a man tell me afterwards, he said, ‘Well, you have no idea how bad it is in rural parts of Pennsylvania. We still have dial up, and a lot of time that doesn’t even work.’ And then I told folks that I’d been talking to some teachers — you know I love teachers — and I’m going to support our teachers. But here is what the teachers told me. They said there had recently been a national survey asking teachers about different things they do in the classroom and the like, and 70 percent of teachers said that they assign homework to their students that requires the students to go on the internet. Now, I think that’s great because we want our kids to be ready for the jobs of the future and that means they’ve got to understand how to learn and find information. But here’s the rub: 5 million kids in America don’t have access to internet in their homes. So you know what? We are leaving those kids behind while they’re still in elementary and secondary schools. That is wrong. We’re going to make sure America, which invented the internet, is the most connected country in the world.And here’s what else we’re going to do: I’m going to support advanced manufacturing, manufacturing of all kinds. Because I believe that we’ve got a real opportunity to bring manufacturing back. I visited a place called Johnstown Wire Technologies in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. They started more than 100 years ago as a steel mill. Now they’re making all kinds of wire products, and they’re starting to bring jobs back from China — to do that work in America.Now, when Donald Trump is asked about where he makes things, he makes them anywhere else but America. His ties, his suits, his shirts, his furniture, his barware — made all over the world. Bangladesh, Turkey, Slovenia, Mexico. And when asked about that, he said, well, we don’t make that stuff in America. Well, I’m here to tell you: Donald, you’re wrong.And here’s how I know. I know he’s wrong because I’ve been collecting information and visiting places that actually do make these things in America. Just today I went to the Knotty Tie Company. And I met folks living right here in Denver who are making ties and scarves. I hope you like this one because I got it at Knotty just a few hours ago. I just got interviewed by one of the local newscasters, and first thing he said to me — he didn’t even know this was from Knotty — he said, ‘That’s a beautiful scarf.’ He said, ‘That looks like it’s got Colorado colors.’ And in fact, one thing I really like about it, is printed right here on the scarf, it says ‘made in Colorado, not China.’So I got so into this that we now have a website — went public today — called hillaryclinton.com/makeithere. And you can go on the website and you can see about 100 places around America where Donald could have made ties, shirts, suits, furniture, barware, right here in America. And I hope that more people will start making things here in America again.So we are going to work to grow the economy, and I look often at Denver and Colorado as examples. And it’s another one of the reasons why I admire your governor — the transit system in Denver — combined with the new airport connecting not only Denver to the airport, but other places in the region, is growing this economy. And very importantly, it’s attracting a lot of young people who want to be able to quickly move from work to home to entertainment and everything else.So we see this happening in lots of places. And so when people say to me, ‘Hey, we can’t do that in America,’ I say, ‘I don’t know which America you’ve been looking at.’ In fact, I couldn’t figure out what country the Republican convention was talking about. A negative, pessimistic view of America — that is not who we are. Do we have challenges? Sure. But can we meet them? Absolutely. We are truly stronger together, and that’s what we’re going to be doing. Now in addition to growing the economy, we’ve got to make it fairer. And I feel very strongly about this. We’ve got to make this economy work for everybody, not just those at the top.So we are going to make these investments. We are going to invest more in education, starting with preschool education. We are going to train 50,000 teachers so that they can teach computer science in junior high and high school. We are going to make college debt free so that everybody can afford to go. And we’re going to make community college free so you can get the skills you need for the jobs of today and tomorrow.And I want to say something really serious about this. John and I have talked about this a lot. Look, I think it’s great; everybody who wants to go to college should be able to afford to go to college. Anybody with student debt — we’re going to help you refinance the debt, because in America, if Donald Trump can plead bankruptcy six times and refinance his debts, American students and families ought to be able to refinance their debts.But my friends, I do not believe that a four-year college education is the only path that we should have to a good job with a rising standard of living. That’s why I want more technical education back in our high schools. That’s why I want more apprenticeship programs in business and unions. I get very excited about this, because there are more than a million jobs right now waiting to be filled, by machinists and tool and die makers, by people with real skills — coders who can get a good job. When I was at Johnstown Wire Technology, it’s a unionized plant. U.S. Steelworkers represent that plant’s workers. And they get some people already trained, and then the union and management train others. And the average salary is over $70,000 a year. We are also going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be living in poverty. And I’ll tell you the fastest way we can raise incomes in America is to guarantee equal pay for women’s work. And I am very — I’m encouraged. When I started talking about this more than a year ago, I could see kind of quizzical looks out in the audience. And then I realized I’ve got to explain this is not just a woman’s issue. If you have a working mother, wife, daughter, or sister, it’s your issue.You see, I get pretty excited about what we’re going to do. I believe with all my heart that America’s best years are still ahead of us. Now, that doesn’t mean that I think it’s going to be easy. But I know we’re up to the job. I just know we are. I have no doubt about that. And we’re also up to the responsibility of leading the world toward peace and prosperity as well. There is no doubt in my mind that Donald Trump is unqualified to be president and unfit to be commander-in-chief. Anyone who spends his time insulting our military, demeaning the service of our POWs and our fallen soldiers, insulting Gold Star families, this is not someone who understands the honor, the duty of serving America. I am so grateful to every single person who has ever put on the uniform of the United States military. And it worries me, some of what I hear him say. I mean, anyone who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near nuclear weapons.And I want to — I want to say a special word about something that’s important here in Colorado. It’s important in the West. And that is we have a responsibility to protect our public lands in America. The outdoor economy, the recreational economy is so important to so many places here in Colorado and elsewhere throughout the West. And I couldn’t believe that Trump has basically gone along with what they put into the Republican platform that would disrupt and take back public lands that are really held in trust for all of us. So I want you to know as president, I will defend and protect America’s public lands and our conservation.So we’re really having a good time in this campaign. And we want everybody to join. I said in my speech on Thursday night I want to be the president for all Americans: Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I want to work for the struggling, the striving, and the successful. I want more people to be lifted up to follow their own dreams. So here’s what I hope you will do. I hope you will join our campaign. And here in Colorado, if you text C-O to 47246, you can get involved or go to our website at hillaryclinton.com. And we are hiring organizers here in Colorado.We are also setting a goal of registering three million more American citizens to vote in November. So make sure you’re registered. Look for your mail ballot in October. And talk to your friends, your neighbors, your colleagues.I believe that we are at a crossroads election. I’ve laid out the best I could, the specific plans and ideas that I want to pursue as your president because I have this old-fashioned idea. When you run for president, you ought to tell people what you want to do as their president. And I have also told you because I want you to hold me accountable. I will get up every single day and work hard for you and fight for you. And I will fight to preserve our rights, whether they are civil rights or human rights or women’s rights or gay rights or voters’ rights or workers’ rights. And I will take on the gun lobby for common sense gun safety reform.One of the — one of the things I said Thursday night, which I will repeat here because I want you to know this, I do not want to repeal the Second Amendment. I do not want to take anyone’s gun away. I just don’t want you to get shot by somebody who shouldn’t have a gun in the first place.So we’ve got great work to do, and I’m excited about doing it with you because I do want you to know what I want to do as your president, to weigh that. It’s like a big job interview. You’re hearing from two people that you might hire. And I, frankly, think it’s better for us to have an economy where you hear ‘You’re hired,’ instead of ‘You’re fired.’So, Colorado, let’s get to work. Let’s win in November. And let’s make sure we build an American future that we all could be part of. Thank you, and God bless you.”","Clinton Official"
"21",2016-08-01,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on economic policy with Warren Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska","Warren Buffett and Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at a rally in Omaha, NebraskaWARREN BUFFETT:“Thank you. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Thank you. Thank you. I think you’ve made it pretty clear who you’ve come to hear, so I’ll –In just a minute, I’m going to talk about my favorite subject, which is going to be what Hillary can and will do in the eight years following January 20th. But before that, there have been a couple of things said by Donald Trump in the last few weeks that I — now, wait till you hear them, then you’ll really boo.So I’d like to clarify a little bit, and these are important points to be made and it’s important that you hear the answer on them.The first point was when he was asked about revealing his income tax returns, which every presidential candidate has done for 40 years. He said, ‘None of your business,’ which did not go over so well. And then he started giving various explanations, and one of the explanations was that he had given his financial statement to the Election Commission, they’re listed as assets and liabilities. But believe me, as someone who’s filled out financial statements and someone who’s filled out an income tax return, I can tell you they are two very different animals. And you will learn a whole lot more about Donald Trump if he produces his income tax return.And so that’s why I’d like to make him an offer — an offer I hope he can’t refuse. Donald Trump at one point — he says various things at different times, but at one point, and I think he said it several times — he said he can’t do it, can’t release it because he’s under audit. Now, I’ve got news for him: I’m under audit too. And I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime between now and election. I will bring my tax return; he can bring his tax return. Nobody’s going to arrest us. It is not — there are no rules against showing your tax returns. And just let people ask us questions about the items that are on there.How many of you would be afraid to have your tax return made public? Yeah, it is not — no, no. You’re only afraid if you’ve got something to be afraid about. And you’re not — he’s not afraid because of what — of the IRS. He’s afraid because of you. So I will meet him in Omaha, or Mar-a-Lago, or he can pick the place — anytime between now and election. I’ll bring my return; he’ll bring his return. We’re both under audit. And believe me, nobody’s going to stop us from talking about what’s on those returns. And send the word to him, if you will.Now, the — another thing he said is he says America isn’t great anymore. You know, you need him. But — because America just isn’t great anymore. Now, everybody is entitled to their opinion. I disagree with him violently on that subject, which I’ll say a little bit about more later. But it’s how he explains what he would do about that, because I’m going to quote his exact words — I’m going to read this because I want to be sure I’ve got it exactly right. He says, ‘No one knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.’ Well, la-dee-da. You know? I mean, this is — only he can fix it. I didn’t really realize we were in such grave danger. I mean, there’s 325 million Americans, and if this guy leaves for Canada, it’s supposed to be hopeless for the rest of us. No, he alone can fix it. It takes some kind of nerve, or something else, to really have the notion that out of 325 million people, you’re the only one who can fix it.Now, I think when somebody makes a statement like that, you should look at his record when he has appealed to the American public before. Now, Donald Trump has been in a lot of businesses, he’s had a lot of bankruptcies, but usually that’s just involved borrowing money from the American public. But in 1995 — to my knowledge it’s the only time — Donald Trump went to the American people and he said, ‘Join me — I’m a winner. Join me and invest in my company,’ Trump hotels and casino resorts. It’s the only time he asked the public to join, but now you got a chance to join the great man in this investment. That was in 1995. They listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and Mr. Trump very modestly made the ticker symbol DJT. Guess what that’s for? So he names the company after himself, or he gets the ticker symbol after himself. In the next 10 years, the company loses money every year — every single year. The — he takes out $44 million in compensation during that period.If you — in 1995, when he offered this company, if a monkey had thrown a dart at the stock page, the monkey on average would have made 150 percent. But the people that believed in him, that listened to his siren song, came away losing well over 90 cents on the dollar. They got back less than a dime. And you know the history of his enterprises where he was borrowing money where one time after another, he went into bankruptcy. I’ve really never known another businessman that brags about his bankruptcies. I mean, and it — to tell you the truth, why not? I mean, it’s his claim to stardom. I don’t know anybody else that’s had six bankruptcies, but there he is.Now, the final straw occurred this weekend, and you know about it. Donald Trump managed to get in front of George Stephanopoulos after Mr. and Mrs. Khan had told about their Gold Star son, and Mr. Khan had offered him a — Mr. Trump a copy of the Constitution. And Donald Trump said this when asked by George Stephanopoulos about –‘Well, Mr. Khan first said you have sacrificed nothing and no one.’ Quite an accurate statement. And Trump said, ‘I think I’ve made a lot of sacrifices. I’ve worked very, very hard. I’ve created thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I’ve had tremendous success.’ And George, a little overcome, said, ‘Those are sacrifices?’ And Trump, believe it or not, said, ‘Oh, sure. I think they’re sacrifices.’Now, the young son of Mr. and Mrs. Khan died a dozen or so years ago. In that dozen of years, we’ve employed a lot of people. I’ve had fun doing it. We’ve made money just like Donald Trump has made. I have made no sacrifice. No member of my family has gone — no member of the Buffett family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan. No member of the Trump family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan. We’ve both done extremely well during this period, and our families haven’t sacrificed anything, and Donald Trump and I haven’t sacrificed anything. But how in the world can you stand up to a couple of parents who have lost a son and talked about sacrificing because you were building a bunch of buildings?I mean, that is — when I heard that, my mind went back — and this goes back before most of you were born — but they went back to the McCarthy hearings. And at the time of the McCarthy hearings — at the time of the Senate McCarthy hearings with the Army, Joe Welch had a young assistant of his maligned by Senator McCarthy, and McCarthy went on and on, and implying this guy was a communist and doing all kinds of things. And finally Joe Welch couldn’t take it anymore and he said, and I’ll quote him, ‘Have you no sense of decency, sir?’ And I ask Donald Trump, have you no sense of decency, sir?I might add — I’d just add one thing. McCarthy’s career went straight downhill after that.Let’s move on to more pleasant subjects. Unlike what Mr. Trump says, America is great. Yes. So let’s talk about the USA. Because 240 years ago, we started with a piece of paper. It was a blueprint for a new society — a society unlike anything the world had ever seen before. And in 1776, that blueprint started us on a path that has finally led to the next woman president. It was imperfect, but it was aspirational.Now, that blueprint has done wonders for this country in terms of overall prosperity. When I was born in 1930, if my parents had seen what the world would look like in 2016, they wouldn’t have believed it. The GDP per capita is six times what it was when I was born. That’s never happened in the history of mankind. It’s a miracle. And the miracle is America. And it still has all the qualities that it had in 1930, and which propelled us forward like this.So America, in terms of delivering wealth, has been incredible. In terms of distributing wealth, it has not been living up to what I consider its potential. I just described to you $56,000 of GDP per capita, and that means a family of four, on average, would have $224,000 of GDP per capita. But it hasn’t worked out that way. This country, while making some people enormously wealthy, has left people behind. And those people were just a willing, probably more willing, to go to Afghanistan.And in Hillary Clinton, you have somebody that cares about that. Let me give you just one more statistic and I’ll get away from that. I know how popular that is. But in the first year of the Forbes 400 back in the 1980s, the aggregate wealth of the 400 was $93 billion. You can look it up on the internet. Currently, it’s $2,374,000,000. That’s 25 for 1. Now, I’d like everybody that’s had 25 for 1 themselves, if they’d raise their hand. Yeah. It hasn’t happened. They told us it would trickle down. Yeah.But what has happened — what has happened is it’s flooded upward. And that almost $2.4 trillion, from 400 people in this country, they’re not bad people. I know a good many of them. I’d like to know more, actually. But they have benefitted from the system that, frankly, tilted toward people like me and the rest of that group. I mean, it’s not because they’re evil, but they’ve taken advantage. They’re the ones with the lobbyists. They’re the ones that come up with carried interest where their income is taxed at rates far lower than almost all of the people in this room.And it’s going to take somebody with strength, resoluteness, brains, energy — it’s going to take that to somebody to effect change. I mean, there’s no question about that. It won’t happen by itself. It takes guts. It is a tough, tough job when you try and change the code on people that are making millions and billions of dollars a year in order to give a better break to the people who work just as hard, maybe harder, and take home a few hundred dollars a week. It’s really wrong that in a country where there’s $56,000 of GDP per person for anybody that works 40 hours a week not to be able to rely on a decent living for their family. It just doesn’t make any sense.And it won’t cure itself, and it certainly won’t be cured with Donald Trump. It’s going to take Hillary Clinton. It’s going to take powers of persuasion. It’s going to take a mandate from the people in their election. But she’s spelling out what she’s going to do, as contrasted to one of the other candidates. She is telling you what she is going to do about the tax code. And when that gets enacted, I’ll be a little worse off, and believe me, I can take it. And you’ll be better off.Now I’d like to make a little news. And this is a surprise even to Hillary. It’s very easy — there were 129 million votes cast in the last presidential election. It’s very easy to think, if you’re watching a TV show or the weather’s a little bad or something, to think, well, my vote really doesn’t count. What difference is it going to make with 129 million? Well, I’ve got some real news for you. It doesn’t make much difference if you’re a Democrat in Idaho or a Republican in California. I mean, you are in a state where the electoral vote’s going to be decided by majority vote, and you’re on the short side in that case.But we live in a very special place. In Nebraska and Maine, we also cast electoral votes by congressional district, and we don’t have to think about 129 million popular votes throughout the country; we have to think about 538 electoral votes. And yesterday on that same George Stephanopoulos show they had four people predicting how the election would come out. And Jonathan Karl of ABC News had gone state by state and come up with — he came up with his notion as to who was going to carry each state and how that would cause the electoral vote to come out. And those of you who watched the show yesterday saw that he came out 269 to 269. He absolutely said that he did not try to come out that way, he just looked state by state — 269 to 269. Now, there’s one district in the United States — I am looking at the people that can change that 269 to 270. It happened in 2008 by 3,200 or 3,325 votes — by this. We actually gave a vote separate than the rest of Nebraska. So it’s been done. It’s been done.But we’re going to help that process along this time. I have pledged today that on Election Day, November 8th, I will take at least 10 people to the polls who would otherwise have difficulty getting there. And when you go home tonight, you can go to a website called Drive2 — that’s for the 2nd Congressional District, it’s the number 2 — Drive2Vote, and if you go there, it will offer you information on three things: how to register; how, if you need a ride on November 8th, you may find someone who will take you, will take care of that; and it’ll also give you the chance to volunteer to take some people, whether it’s 10 or a lesser number. Today, I reserved Ollie the Trolley for November 8th. It seats 32. I’m going to be on it all day. I’m going to do selfies — whatever it takes. And if it’s snowing, if it’s cold, my goal and the goal of the people who’ve joined me on this in this drive to vote — my goal is to have the turnout in Douglas-Sarpy Counties, the 2nd District, is to have the turnout here be the highest percentage of potential voters of any district in the country. Let’s — Let’s give America a civics lesson. How about it? Everybody in the 2nd District, yeah? And if the people in this room, each one of you would pledge to take 10 people, that — I can almost guarantee that’ll be the march of the victory.So join me. If you can take 20, do that. If you can only take three or four, that’s fine too. But get that neighbor who is watching that television program or […] and shame him into coming with you to the polls. Now, just remember, Drive2Vote. Okay.Now, if you’ve read the Constitution, which apparently some people haven’t — if you read Article II, it deals with the presidency. Article II of the Constitution, look it up. That’s where they describe the presidency. We wrote that Constitution; 39 men signed it. How would you ever guess? You’ll find out in a minute. Thirty-nine men signed it, and in Article II, describing the qualifications for the president of the United States, male pronouns –‘he,’ ‘his’ and ‘him’ — were used 20 times. Just imagine that. And it’s still in the Constitution 227 years later. ‘He,’ ‘his’ and ‘him.’ No ‘hers,’ no ‘shes.’ Well, on January 20th, we’re going to elect the best president we’ve ever had, and somebody is going to change those pronouns: Hillary Rodham Clinton!”HILLARY CLINTON:“Wow! Thank you. Thank you all so much. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Omaha. Thank you. Thank you, Congressional District 2. I am so delighted to be back here with so many friends and supporters, and with everyone here today. And especially, I want to thank Warren Buffett for that kind and generous introduction. I’ve heard Warren called the Omaha Oracle. I call him my friend. He is an American original. I am honored to have his support, and I love the idea that together all of you are going to aim to have the highest percentage turnout of any congressional district in America.It’s great to be here at the North High School — the Magnet School. I had a chance to say hello to your principal, Gene Haynes. And I see scattered throughout the crowd both students and teachers, and I love teachers. Thank you. I also wanted to thank a former colleague of mine in the United States Senate, your former Senator, Ben Nelson. I have to tell you, I’ve had the best week. Any of you watch the convention? I was so excited to have the opportunity for so many people who care about our country, who have contributed in many different ways, to have a chance to stand before America, and to tell their stories. Because America is story after story. And what I want is to provide the opportunity and the support so that every single American can live his or her best story, can make the most of your own God-given potential.And after the convention was over, starting Friday morning, Tim Kaine and his wonderful wife Anne — and Bill and I got on a bus and started traveling across Pennsylvania, into Ohio; we visited factories, small towns, bigger cities. We met with so many hard-working people who told us their stories. And they proved every day that Donald Trump is wrong. America is not weak. I agree with Warren. This is the greatest nation on earth, and our best days are still ahead of us.Now, that doesn’t mean we don’t have challenges and problems. Of course we do. Right here at home and around the world. But I don’t believe there is anything that Americans can’t do if we make up our minds, because, you know why? We are stronger together. But as Warren said, too many people haven’t gotten a raise since the great crash. There’s too much inequality and too little opportunity. Washington is paralyzed by special interests and big money. But don’t let anyone tell you we don’t have what it takes if we make up our minds to solve our problems. And don’t believe anyone who tells you, ‘I alone can fix it.’When Donald Trump said that in his convention speech, I did a bit of a mental double take. I listened to that speech, 75 minutes of it, and it was like he was talking about a different country. Forgetting about everyone in America who gets up every day and works together. People who make a difference every single day. He’s forgetting our troops on the front lines, he’s forgetting police officers and firefighters who run toward danger. He’s forgetting about doctors and nurses who save lives, and teachers who change lives. He’s forgetting about unions who fight for working families, and communities that pull together through hard times.I grew up in the Midwest. I was born in Chicago, raised outside of Chicago. My dad was a small businessman. I mean, really small. It was mostly just him and occasionally my mother, my brothers, and me. And sometimes he’d hire helpers to get one of his orders out, because he printed fabrics to be made into draperies. And he had a print plant with long tables. He was a very self-reliant man. But I don’t think he, for a minute, through his growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, through his service as a chief petty officer in the Navy, through his work in business or his raising our family, ever thought to himself, ‘I alone can fix it.’That’s just not the way we were raised. We were raised to get together. We were raised to follow up on the extraordinary example of our founders 240 years ago, in Philadelphia, who came together. You see that across Nebraska. You see people working. I’ve been in Omaha. I have visited projects, schools, other kinds of nonprofits and institutions where people are working together. That’s what we do in America. We see a problem and we say, ‘We’ll fix it together.’ And that’s what we’re going to do when we get the White House to move us forward in the direction we need to go.Now, I know how hard the great recession was. It was a terrible time. The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And people in Nebraska worked hard to come back. I think it was a terrible moment. It could’ve gotten even worse. I believe that a lot of difficult decisions had to be made. And we have come back from that terrible financial crisis. Thanks to the hard work of Nebraskans, Americans, and President Obama, we got out of the ditch we were in. So I think if we’re going to solve the problems we have, we ought to be really clear about where we’ve come from. We now have 15 million new jobs that have been created in the last 7 ½ years. We now have 20 million more Americans who have access to healthcare. We have the highest percentage ever in our history of young people walking across graduation stages to get their high school diplomas.So I know we’ve made progress, but I know we shouldn’t be satisfied. As Americans, we always have to be asking ourselves, what can we do better? How can we make more progress? How can we help more people? We’re still facing tough challenges that developed long before the recession, and they’ve stayed with us. The economy is not working the way it should for everyone. Starting in Iowa back in April 2015, until the convention this week, I have met so many people who tell me, you know, they don’t expect a handout. They don’t even expect, you know, life to be easy. But they don’t think it should be this hard.It shouldn’t be that people feel like they’re out there on their own, like no one cares about them, that they’re not respected. That the dignity of their job is not something that we all support. I know a lot of people who feel that way. I bet there are some in this gymnasium who feel that way. Well, here’s what I want you to know: You deserve a president who will get up every single day in the White House and do everything she can to give you the chance you deserve to have.And I will quickly add, as important as it is to have someone who gets what you’re going through, I think it’s also really important that that person tells you what her plans are for producing results. So if you saw what I said on Thursday night, let me give you the short, punchier version. And it starts by making clear, we do have to rewrite the rules so that our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. My overriding mission as president will be to do everything I can to help our country create more jobs with rising income. I believe anyone willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well — enough to support a family.So in my first 100 days, we are going to break through the gridlock in Washington and make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. We are going to make the boldest investment in American infrastructure since the highway system. Warren read you some of the quotes from Donald Trump. Well, he has said so many things that I profoundly, vehemently disagree with. And for the life of me, I don’t know why someone runs to be president of the United States who thinks and says, we never win anymore. Our country is full of losers. Well, he could not be more wrong. We are going to fix and build the roads, the bridges, the tunnels, the ports, the airports, the water systems we need.And I want to say a particular word to any of you here from rural Nebraska. We’re going to bring diverse economic development to rural communities to support our farmers and others in small towns who keep America going. And one specific way we will do that is to make sure we have an electric grid that can take and distribute energy from clean, renewable sources. In fact, I know, because I’ve seen them in the crowd, there are a few people from Iowa here today. And your neighbor Iowa is already getting one third of its electricity from clean energy, primarily wind energy. And what I love about that is, they’re also giving farmers extra income for hosting the turbines on their farm, and they are taking abandoned factories and actually assembling the wind turbines, putting people to work in Iowa to produce the energy in Iowa.The other thing we’re going to do is finish the job of building out broadband so everybody in America, no matter where you live, has access to the Internet. I don’t know how we build a 21st-century economy for our young people if we don’t give every home and business access to high-speed Internet connectivity. And I learned something from talking to some of my teacher friends — as I said, I do love teachers, and I’m going to work with you to support you.And here’s what they told me. They told me that a recent survey found 70 percent of our teachers give homework assignments to their students that require them to use the Internet. Now, that makes perfect sense. We want to have a really great opportunity for young people to understand how to be involved with and use the Internet. But here’s the rub. We have 5 million kids in America who don’t have access to the Internet in their homes. So already they’re being left out and left behind. We don’t have a child to waste. We need every child to be given an education to prepare them for the future.So, to me, it’s real simple. If we invest in infrastructure, we’re going to put millions of people to work, and we’re going to lay the foundation for new jobs in the future. The second thing we’re going to do is invest in American manufacturing. And here’s why. A lot of people say, you know, we can’t make things in America anymore. And they think about all of the jobs we’ve lost because of low wage labor and other problems. Well, here’s what I have seen — and I’ve seen it all over America — I was just in a plant in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. A wire plant called Johnstown Wire Technologies.And I was talking — it’s a plant that’s been there more than 100 years. Started off as a steel plant. Now it’s making wire products. And I was talking to them, and I said, well, what kind of future do you think you have? And they said, boy, if we get the right support, we’ve got a great future. We’re actually bringing jobs back from China to Johnstown, Pennsylvania. When I was your Secretary of State, I visited 112 countries, and I went to a lot of places that really want American-made products. They’re the best, the most innovative. Nobody can outwork or outcompete American workers or American businesses.So what I want to do — I want to support manufacturers, large and small. And again, I hear Trump talking a big game about — I think he says, putting America first. Well, I don’t know what part of ‘America first’ leads him to make Trump furniture in Turkey, not Nebraska. Or Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Or Trump barware in Slovenia, not Ohio. He says he wants to make America great again. Well, he could start by actually making things in America again.And then just this week we find out he’s asking for permission to get visas to bring more foreign workers, which he has used consistently, to work in his country clubs, on his golf courses. And he was asked, I think, on that same interview Warren was talking about — he goes, oh, well, it’s very hard to find people. Well, I bet together we could find thousands of people who would like to work at a country club or on a golf course in America.We’re also going to take seriously the education and training of our young people, and people in midcareer. We’re going to invest in STEM education, which is part of the mission here. I want us to provide to every student in America the chance to learn computer science like you’re doing here at OmahaNorth High School. We are going to partner with the private sector to train up to 50,000 computer science teachers over the next decade, so they’re in the classroom preparing our young people. We’re also going to make college tuition free for the middle class, and debt-free for everybody.And we will liberate millions of people who already have student debt. It is just not fair that Donald Trump takes bankruptcy six times to get out from under his debts, and we won’t let families and students refinance their student debt. And here’s something else. I don’t think we say this enough. College is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America. Right now, there are millions of job openings. We don’t have enough machinists or welders or coders. We need more skilled people in the trades because a lot of the people who know how to do that work are going to be retiring in the next 10 or 15 years. That’s why I want to support more business and union apprenticeship initiatives, targeted higher education programs, more training. We’re going to help people build a better future.And, finally, we are going to support the kind of small businesses that Donald Trump has consistently stiffed. Like I said, my dad was a very small businessman. I take this really personally. I had no idea before he started running and information began coming to light what he has done to hurt people. I said in the convention Atlantic City, New Jersey, hardworking contractors, small businesses, were left holding the bag after Trump refused to pay their bills. I’m talking about painters, landscapers, plumbers, the people who installed the glass in his casino, the people who laid the marble floor in his casino. They needed the money. They did the work. They bought the supplies. And he didn’t pay them, not because he couldn’t but because he wouldn’t. That is just not the way you do business in America. We make good on our promises.Well, I think about my dad standing over those big bolts of fabric. You take a silkscreen. You put it down. You pour paint in it. You take a squeegee. You go from one side to the other. Then you lift it up, and you keep going down the table. Then maybe you come back, and you add another color with a different silkscreen. And then, finally, you finish.My dad would get contracts. He would do the work. Then he would load the fabrics into his car, and he would take them to the places that had ordered them: hotels, offices, restaurants. And he expected to be paid. If one of his major customers had refused, he would have been forced to close up his business. Luckily, he never had a contract with Donald Trump. If you hire someone to do a job and they do it, you pay them. You don’t go around bullying small businesses just because you can.Small businesses are the backbone of this economy. And I want to be a small business president. We’re going to make it easier to give credit, to cut red tape. Too many dreams still die in the parking lots of banks in America. If you can dream it, you should be able to build it.I also will tell you exactly how I’m going to pay for everything I have proposed. If you go to my website, hillaryclinton.com, you can see. It’s not complicated. It’s exactly what Warren said, ‘Follow the money.’ And I’m glad — I’m glad Warren is so good-humored about it because the super-rich, Wall Street and corporations, are going to start paying their fair share for supporting the United States of America. And this is not because — this is not because we resent success. We welcome success as long as you do it fairly and don’t abuse people on the way up. But 90 percent of the income gains have gone to the wealthiest 1 percent in America. Our tax code is full of loopholes and special breaks that make it even worse.And what I really appreciate about Warren is he has said — and he has said it consistently — he should never be able to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. And he is right. So I have said I am going to follow Warren’s example. Being successful doesn’t have to come at the expense of others. He knows that real value comes from helping more people invest in themselves. Their businesses grow the economy. And so we’re going to use him and his ideas about how we’re going to tax the wealthy more as the real foundation of making the investments in America that will help everybody.Now, I don’t — I’m told that Donald Trump stays glued to the TV set. So I hope he heard Warren. There’s always — there’s always time for a conversion because while Warren is standing up for a fairer tax code, Trump wants to cut taxes for the super-rich. Well, we’re not going there, my friends. I’m telling you right now we’re going to write fairer rules for the middle class, and we aren’t going to raise taxes on the middle class.And while we’re at it, we would like to see those tax returns, wouldn’t we? My husband and I have put out I think about 33 or 34 years’ worth if you’re interested. He doesn’t even respect the American people enough to do what every other presidential candidate has done for decades and release them. It’s time for Trump to stop hiding. It’s time to stand up for working families. It’s time to make clear that when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And that’s what we’re going to get back to doing.So, my friends, I will not rest until we get wages and incomes rising. I will not rest until we make it clear what’s at stake in this election. And that’s why I need your help. I just want to — I want to throw into the challenge that Warren made if this congressional district has the highest percentage of votes in any congressional district and, of course, if I win, here’s what we’ll do. I will shortly after I become president, sometime as soon as I can arrange it, come back here. And Warren and I will dance […] together. And maybe if we’re really lucky, he’ll wear his Elvis costume again.Please join this campaign. Text JOIN, J-O-I-N. Go to 47246. Go to hillaryclinton.com. And, oh, by the way, we are hiring organizers in Nebraska. So let’s have some fun. Let’s register voters. Let’s turn people out. And let’s win this election for America’s future. Thank you.”","Clinton Official"
"22",2016-07-31,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on the economy in Columbus, Ohio","TIM KAINE:“Hello, Columbus. Wow. Man, we have had an intense week, and we roll up here, as tired as we can be, and you just gave us a shot of energy. Whew. This is so cool. This is so cool.Hey, let me do — let me do a couple of thank-yous. I want to thank Roger Teeters, who just did the introduction, proud Vietnam vet, proud Vietnam vet. I think one thing we showed this week in Philadelphia is what a patriotic, upbeat, optimistic, pro-America party we are in the Democratic Party. And you guys show us the great beauty of our country.Wasn’t Philadelphia so different than that dark and twisted convention that the Republicans put on the week before? I know we’ve got the mayor here and Congresswoman and Governor Strickland, who is going to be a fantastic U.S. Senator. Give them a round of applause. And I really mean that, what we said about Philadelphia. I know we felt that the hospitality there was great, that the spirit of our Democratic family was great. And it was such a contrast with that, kind of the dark, twisted vision that Donald Trump says is America, but, really, it’s just a tour through Donald Trump’s head. And, folks, that’s a scary place to be, scary place to be.But we’ve had a great three-day bus tour. We get on the ticket. We do the convention. We hop on this bus tour through Pennsylvania and Ohio, talking about job creation, talking about Hillary Clinton’s plans and what we’ll do in her administration. This is the last stop on the tour. And it’s great to finish strong in Columbus.I want to introduce you to my wife, Anne Holton, who is my wife of 32 years. We’re proud parents of three. She was the Secretary of Education in Virginia until last Monday. After I was asked by Secretary Clinton to be a running mate, Anne walked in and said, ‘I want to campaign full-time for this ticket.’ She stepped down from her position. And having her on the road with me makes me a very happy warrior. She is a great public servant.And then we’ve also had the great benefit up until the events this morning of having another travel buddy during the bus tour, President Bill Clinton. Now, that’s pretty cool. That’s pretty cool. I said yesterday that I’ve been in politics for 22 years. Mr. Mayor, I was a city councilman and mayor before I was a governor and senator, started at the local level. I thought I knew something about politics after 22 years, but spending about 15 minutes on a bus with Bill Clinton, you realize, man, now, there’s a guy who knows some things about politics. It was really exciting for Anne and I to be on this tour.”AUDIENCE MEMBER: “You’re going to be our next VP, Tim.”TIM KAINE: “Thank you. Thank you.But I will also say I just — I am so proud to be on this ticket. I am proud — I am proud that Hillary Clinton, out of a number of spectacular people who could have been her running mate, asked, ‘Tim, will you do this with me?’ I’m so humbled about it. I’m so excited to work with somebody who, as President Obama said the other night, has got to be the best qualified person to be a nominee for President of the United States in a very long time.So I’m proud and we’re having fun, but I’ll just go one more reason that I’m excited about this. One more reason I’m excited to say a couple things about the race and out opponent, and then introduce Hillary Clinton. This is a historic election. This is a historic nomination. And I was standing on the podium Thursday night after Hillary did her acceptance speech and the balloons started falling. My 81-year-old mother and my wife were standing there with me. My mom Kathy put her arms on my shoulders and said, ‘This is the happiest moment of my life.’ ‘Of my life.’Now, there was a lot of reasons she was saying that, but I’ll tell you one of the reasons is this: because we were making history not just by nominating the best-qualified major party nominee in a very long time if ever, but we were also nominating that the first woman to be president. And here’s what I thought of, here’s what I thought of: How many strong women have helped me in 22 years in politics, been campaign managers for me, campaign staffers, volunteers, member of my cabinet, supporting me, so that I could have a great political career, my wife supporting me so I could have a great political career, just like I’ve supported her in her public service career.But if you look at that whole arc of American history, how many strong women have stood behind strong men leaders? I think it’s time for the strong men of America to show that we can stand up and support a strong woman president of this country, of this country. Now — ”AUDIENCE: “Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!”TIM KAINE: “Hillary!”AUDIENCE: “Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!”TIM KAINE: “Can I be honest and just tell you the one bad thing about this week? I mean, I’ve got to be honest. Before I was on the ticket, Donald Trump didn’t have any reason to call me a name. So when I got on the ticket, he had to figure out how to call me a name. So the morning after I became the nominee he did a press conference, and he took a mike and he said that Tim Kaine, he was a really lousy governor of New Jersey.Now, I’m a sensitive guy; I don’t like criticism. And so I kind of felt bad until I realized, wait a minute, I was never governor of New Jersey. I’ve never even lived in New Jersey.But look, guys, give Donald a break; he’s new to this. He’s new to this. You know the basic civics, there’s 50 states and Virginia is different than New Jersey. I’m sure that’s in the briefing book a few pages later, he’s not there yet.Look, we’re on this tour and we’re having fun, but it’s about something real serious, which is about the American economy and how to grow it, because Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have real different plans. I like making things simple so I’m going to make it simple. Would you rather have a ‘You’re fired’ president or a ‘You’re hired’ president? I thought so. I thought so. And I predict this: After Donald Trump loses this race, and after everybody has forgotten virtually everything about his candidacy, the one thing people will remember about Donald Trump is two words: ‘You’re fired.’ ‘You’re fired.’Hillary has — is going to be a ‘You’re hired’ president and she’s going to talk a little bit about what we’ve been both talking about and learning about on the trail with factory stops and rallies. The American economy was in a freefall at the end of the Bush administration. President Obama has pulled it out, and we’re climbing again. But we got a long way to go. We got a long way to go because we need to grow jobs and make sure that the growth is not just for a few, but that the growth is shared by all. And so to do that, Hillary’s got a very dynamic plan about how to grow our economy and grow it for all.It involves skills training. It involves major investment in advanced manufacturing. It involves infrastructure. It involves debt-free college so people can get the skills that they need to be successful. It involves things that should be just basic, like raising the federal minimum wage so you can’t work full-time and be below the poverty level. And it also means making sure that women are entitled to equal pay for equal work.Now, these are the basics of the Hillary Clinton ‘You’re hired’ plan. And guess what? She is respectful enough of y’all — I don’t know, do you use that in Columbus? Yeah, okay. Am I okay? She is respectful enough of the voters to share the details. You go on hillaryclinton.com. One click of a mouse, you can see how she’ll do it, how she’ll pay for it, how she’ll benefit. Right? And she said this the other night at the convention. I liked this line. She said, ‘I’m going to give you the details.’ Some people criticize the details. ‘Oh, I don’t want to know about the details.’ But here’s what she said. ‘If it’s about your kid, if it’s about your family, if it’s about your business, it ain’t a detail. It’s a big deal. It’s a big deal.’ And she’s going to share the plan.Go over to the other side of the aisle. Donald Trump? No plans, folks. No plans. I mean, he talked for 75 minutes at the convention, criticized Hillary Clinton, and made a lot of big, broad claims without any substance behind them. In fact, if you ask Donald a question, he’ll say, ‘I’m going to create jobs,’ or, ‘We’re going to all be rich,’ or, ‘We’re going to beat ISIS,’ or, ‘We’re going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it.’ And you ask him, ‘Well, how are you going to do any of those things?’ And he just says, ‘Believe me.’ ‘Believe me.’ Huh. ‘Believe me. Believe me.’But here’s the problem. A lot of people have believed Donald Trump and gotten stiffed, gotten hurt, gotten — there’s a lot of stories of contractors. Hillary Clinton and I both grew up in families where our dads ran small businesses. Her dad ran a drape and fabric-printing factory, and my dad ran an ironworker-organized welding shop. And so we’re used to businesses. A whole lot of small businesses have done deals with Donald Trump to help him build golf courses, build casinos, et cetera, only to get stiffed after the job was done. They did the work. They were entitled to the pay. But Donald and his phalanx of lawyers said, ‘We’re not paying you. Sue us. We’ll run you into the ground. Even if you win, you’ll pay so much in lawyers’ fees it won’t be worth anything.’ They got hurt, and many of them lost their businesses because they believed Donald Trump.Retirees in Florida, hundreds of them, gave Trump money to build them condos, and they never go the condos, and they never got the money. They got burned and lost part of their savings because they believed Donald Trump. Students — I know. Hey, look, Columbus is a big town for students. Right? Big town for college. So young people like vets and others who wanted to advance, Donald Trump said, ‘Hey, give me a bunch of dough and be part of my Trump University. And then I’ll just guarantee you’ll have a path paid for success in your life.’ And they gave him a lot of money, and they ended up with a certificate that wasn’t even worth the paper it was written on. They got ripped off all because they believed Donald Trump.And so now he’s just saying, ‘Oh, I’ll do all these things, believe me,’ but we are just too great a nation to believe a guy who’s ripped off virtually everybody he’s come in contact with. We cannot put a nation as great as the United States in the hands of an empty-promising, self-promoting, one-man wrecking crew. We just can’t do it, folks. We just can’t do it.And so I want to ask you a question, and I hope you’ll ask everybody this question, and that is this: When Donald Trump says, ‘Believe me,’ does anybody here I mean even come close to believing this guy? I mean, do you believe even one word of what he says? That’s my attitude. Not one word. Not one word, folks. Not one word. And that’s what we’ve got to do on this trail, convince others that they shouldn’t be so gullible to fall for Trump’s no-details promises, either.Okay. Look. Now it is my great pleasure. We’ve had fun on these couple of days. And I hope you’ll keep us in your thoughts and encouragement and prayers. It’s 100 days to Election Day. And Anne and I get the virtue of just joining with like 105 days left. Now, this has been like an 18-month or multi-year effort on Hillary Clinton’s side. But it’s going to be tough. It’s going to be challenging. But nothing important in life is meant to be easy. And Democrats know tough, folks, and Ohioans know tough.So let me introduce to a great leader, a tough leader, a compassionate leader, and the next president of the United States, my friend Hillary Clinton.HILLARY CLINTON:Hello, Columbus. I am just so happy to be here on this absolutely glorious, beautiful Ohio afternoon. And I am so glad to be making this journey with Senator Tim Kaine and Anne Holton because they understand what public service is all about. They are committed to doing everything they can — as Tim has, starting on city council, mayor, lieutenant governor, governor, and now senator — to give people the best chance they can to get ahead and stay ahead. So please join me again in thanking Senator Tim Kaine.And Mayor Ginther, we’re happy to be here in your beautiful capital city here in Columbus. And I don’t know how you all felt, but boy, I thought your congresswoman really knocked it out of the park at the convention. I haven’t even had time to tell Joyce this, but I think it might have been on the very first night she was sitting in the box with my husband, sitting right next to him. And all of a sudden, Twitter was going crazy, ‘Who is that beautiful, well-dressed, elegant woman sitting next to Bill Clinton?’ And finally, somebody says, ‘That’s the congresswoman from Ohio,’ and I was so proud to have her support.Now, there’s somebody else with us, somebody very special to us, somebody special to Ohio, your former governor, Ted Strickland. I’ve had the great privilege of knowing Ted for decades. I’ve seen how hard he has worked. He got dealt a bad hand being governor during the Republican-generated Great Recession and doing everything he could to try to help Ohio and get through that. Well, now he’s running to represent you in the Senate. I think your other great senator, Sherrod Brown, deserves a partner. Every time Sherrod stands up and fights for you, he needs a partner to do the same and not have his vote canceled out. So do everything you can to send Ted Strickland to the Senate in November.Tim’s right; we’ve had a great time. How many of you watched the convention? I was so proud to see Democrats standing up and speaking about what we can do together to make sure the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top, taking on the special interests that have benefited from a system that is rigged in their favor.So when we finished those four days, I was thrilled to get on that bus in Philadelphia and head out across Pennsylvania and into Ohio. And along the way, we stopped at factories, where hardworking Americans are still making things. We stopped at a factory in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where business and management works with the steel workers who are there represented by their union fighting hard to have more good jobs. They told me how they are bringing jobs back from China, how they’re creating more opportunity.That’s the American story that we’re going to be telling during this campaign during these last 100 days. I have specific plans about how we’re going to get the economy working for everybody. We are going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II and put millions of Americans to work.And here’s how we’re going to do it: We’re going to invest in infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. But not just what you can physically see; we need a new electric grid to be able to take and distribute all the clean renewable energy we’re going to be producing.And we need to finish the job of connecting every home and business in America to high-speed broadband internet access. I talk a lot about building our economy, getting jobs for everyone. Well, it’s a little heartbreaking to learn, as I did when I was talking to some teachers a few days ago — and I love teachers — and the teachers told me they had just had a national survey done, and learned that 70 percent of the teachers in America assign homework to their students that required kids to go on the internet.Now, that makes sense. We’re living in the information age. We want more people, particularly young people, to help create that future so we have even more opportunities. But here’s the problem: 5 million kids in America don’t have access at home to high-speed internet. So already they’re being left behind. So we’ve got to build America’s competition, build America’s opportunities, and the plans that we’ve laid out will do just that.I also believe we need to do more for small business. 98 percent of the businesses in Ohio are small businesses. Let’s have greater access to credit. Let’s be sure we cut through and eliminate any of the red tape and the other obstacles. You heard Tim say his dad ran a small business. So did mine. My father ran a print plant where fabrics were printed with designs for draperies. I was there helping him, but I know how hard he worked. And I am personally sickened when I hear the stories about Donald Trump refusing to pay plumbers and painters and marble installers and glass installers and small businesses who have done the work.I think about my dad. He worked hard. What would have happened if the customers he had, after he printed those drapery fabrics, made them into draperies, loaded them into his car, delivered them, helped to install them, and somebody like Donald Trump said, ‘We’re not paying you?’ My dad would have said, ‘What do you mean? I did was I was contracted to do.’ But to person after person and business after business, Donald Trump said, ‘I don’t care.’ It’s not because he couldn’t pay them. He wouldn’t pay them. He drove businesses into bankruptcy in addition to taking bankruptcy himself six times. My friends, that’s not how we do business in America. If you do the work, you deserve the pay. And we’re going to stand up and make that case against Donald Trump.The other thing about Trump — you’ve heard him — he says, ‘America first.’ Sounds real, doesn’t it? As if we wouldn’t put America first. That’s sure what I believe. He says it. But then everything he makes, he makes somewhere else. He makes dress shirts in China, not Brooklyn, New York. He makes furniture in Turkey, not Cleveland, Ohio. He makes barware in Slovenia, not Jackson, Ohio. And he goes around saying he wants to put America first and American workers first.And then just today we learn, once again, he’s asked for visas to employ foreign workers at his country clubs because he says he can’t find any American workers. Shame on you, Donald Trump. Shame on you. Let’s cut through all of the hype and the rhetoric and understand that we’re dealing with somebody who has a history of stiffing people, making things somewhere else besides America, and whenever possible, hiring foreign workers. I don’t think that adds up in any way to making America great again. I think it adds up to making Donald Trump more money, that’s what it’s all about.So we’re not only going to grow the economy and create more jobs for American workers — we are going to make the economy fairer. We are going to raise the minimum wage so that nobody who works full-time will be in poverty. And you’ve heard it before, but I’ll say it again: The fastest way to raise incomes in America is to pay women equal pay for the work we do. Now, this is not just a woman’s issue. This is a family issue. If you’ve got a working mother, wife, sister, or daughter, it’s your issue. And we are going to enforce the laws and finally make it absolutely clear: No more discrimination against women who work in the workplace.So I know we’re up against some powerful forces, and here’s what I want you to know. As you talk to your friends, your neighbors, about this election, everything I’ve proposed — and you can go to hillaryclinton.com and read all about it — I’ve told you how I will pay for it. How will I pay for it? I will pay for everything I’ve proposed by making the wealthy corporations and Wall Street finally pay their fair share of taxes. Somebody asked me, well, why are you doing that? Do you resent success?No, I don’t resent success. I do resent people taking advantage of other people to try to become successful. But the reason we’re going to get the wealthy to pay is that’s where the money is. They have earned 90 percent of all of the income gains since the recession. That’s the top 1 percent. And I just think, like that old movie says, you’ve got to follow the money. And the money is with the super-wealthy.Now, we’re also going to do more for education, starting with preschool education. We’re going to support our teachers in order to give them what they need to do the job we’re asking them to do. We are going to make four-year college affordable by making it debt-free. And we’re going to help those of you who have student debt pay it back at a lower interest rate, at a faster timetable. And if you do public service like teaching, policing, firefighting, social work, we will forgive your debt. This seems to me also to be fair. Donald Trump gets to refinance and forgive his debts. Well, what about the families and students of America who get to have some help with their debts? So if you vote for us, that’s exactly what we’re going to do next year.So there’s a big agenda, and I watched what’s happened over the last two weeks. A lot of the rhetoric that came from Trump and his convention was so dark, so pessimistic, so negative. I know we’ve got problems and challenges. I’m not taking a position that we don’t have work to do. In fact, I’m telling you what work we can do together. But at the end of the day, we Americans are better when we roll up our sleeves, we set some goals, and we work together, because yes, we are stronger together.And I am very excited about what we can do. You see, I view this campaign as a giant job interview. I am here telling you what I want to achieve, asking for your vote, and asking you also to hold me accountable. I want you not just to vote for me in November but help me be the best president I can be for all Americans. I want to be the president for every American. And that’s why today Tim and I and Anne are here, because we are kicking off this campaign in Ohio.And yes, we have a lot of other issues that we are concerned about. I see some of the t-shirts and the signs. We will defend Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks. We will defend and improve benefits under Social Security. We will take on the gun lobby for comprehensive gun safety reforms. We will take on the real challenges that confront America, not pick fights with people, not act as though some folks are better than others, not insult and finger-point. We’re going to stand up for Americans’ rights: for women’s rights and gay rights and voting rights and workers’ rights.But we can’t do any of this without your help. And I’m asking for it. We need you to get involved in the campaign. And right now, if you will text JOIN, J-O-I-N, at 47246 or go to hillaryclinton.com, you can find out how to get involved. And, by the way, we are hiring organizers in Ohio if you’re interested in being part of our campaign staff because at the end of this election, I want people to have made an informed choice. I don’t want folks to be misled, to listen to the rhetoric and the demagoguery.I personally think that Donald Trump poses a serious threat to our democracy. And it’s going to be up to all of us to repudiate the hatefulness, attacks on distinguished military leaders, like General John Allen, who came to the Democratic Convention because he loves a country that he served for more than 40 years and wanted to be clear about what he thought was best for our national security, or insulting the family of a fallen soldier, Captain Khan, an American Muslim who sacrificed his life to protect his unit and other soldiers as a taxi raced toward the gates of a base containing a bomb.When his father spoke at the convention and pulled out a copy of the Constitution, it was so fitting that happened in Philadelphia, where our country started 240 years ago. They enshrined in our Constitution the principle of religious liberty. They understood that America would be including and attracting people from all over the world. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, they addressed different religions, including Islam, that were present in America way back at our beginning. And I want us always to stand for freedom and equality and justice and opportunity now and forever. Help us go out and win an election that will keep our democracy strong, our economy growing, and give every American a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.Thank you so much, Columbus.”","Clinton Official"
"23",2016-07-30,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on manufacturing and jobs in Youngstown, Ohio","Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at a rally in Youngstown, Ohio. TIM KAINE:“Hey, guys. Man, this is great. Wow. This is great. Hey, were we worth the wait? Were we worth the wait? Yeah, absolutely. It is — thank you for giving us this great shot of energy. Hello to the Valley. Hello to Ohio. We’re so glad to be here on our bus tour. We’ve come out of a spectacular Democratic Convention in Philadelphia, and we’re glad to be in Ohio. There’s a reason why traveling through Pennsylvania and Ohio comes first. It’s because you guys are so critical to the outcome of this election. And I can’t tell you how proud we are to be here with you. Thank you for this warm, warm Ohio welcome. We had great UAW introducers, Glenn and Robert. We are so glad to be here with your formed governor and future senator, Ted Strickland. We served together; he’s a huge, huge hero of mine. You’ve got one of the best congress members of the United States Congress, Tim Ryan. Give it up for him. Give it up for Tim. And then your state senator, who is the lead Dem in the Ohio legislature, who told me that he was going to get us the best pizza in Ohio for the bus on the way after tonight. Give it up for Joe Schiavoni.This has been a long day and a fun day, and I am so glad to be here with my wife, Anne, who until a few days ago was the secretary of education in Virginia. But my wife Anne walked into the office Monday, before we went to the convention, and resigned so she could be full-time on the trail to make sure Hillary Clinton is elected our next president. And how great is this to be campaigning with President Clinton? I mean — I started my career in elected office 22 years ago, and I’ve learned more on the bus in the last eight hours — about politics than I’ve learned in 22 years. We have had a wonderful, wonderful time.It has been a great week, and I tell you, when Hillary Clinton called me at 7:32 last Friday night — I mean, who’s counting? — 7:32-ish last Friday night and asked if I would be her running mate in this history-making campaign in an incredibly important time in our country, I just can’t tell you how humbled it made me — excited, but humbled too. I mean, this is just a remarkable woman, a remarkable leader, the most qualified person. As President Obama said the other night when he spoke — wasn’t his speech fantastic Wednesday night? As he said the other night when he spoke, Hillary Clinton is the most qualified person to head a ticket of any party for a long time, and probably ever. And so of course I was honored; as somebody who’s been a mayor and a governor and Senator, I was honored to say I would love to be on this ticket to help this most qualified person be the next president and to help tackle one challenge after the next and keep America moving forward with an optimistic and patriotic view of this country. Of course I’m going to do it.But there was one other reason that made me very, very excited. As we stood out on the stage together on Thursday night after she gave that magnificent speech following that fantastic introduction by Chelsea — as we stood out on that stage together with balloons falling and the history of electing — nominating the first woman of a major party to be our nominee, my 81-year-old mom, Kathy, was with me out on stage; Anne and my whole family, my mom and dad were there. And my mom looked at me as the balloons were falling and said, ‘Tim, this is the best night of my life.’ And I’ll tell you why. We’re backing Hillary because she’s the most qualified person to be president, but we can add to our excitement a little bit because I just was reflecting, as my mom said that, the number of strong women who have supported me through my 22-year political career — Anne supporting me just as I’ve supported her in her career. But think about — thinking about all the campaign managers and volunteers and finance directors and staff and voters, and the majority of the American electorate is women, and by far the majority of the electorate to vote for Democrats is women, and I have always been able to be in leadership positions because strong women were willing to support me. And I think it’s just about time, after like 240-plus years — after about 240-plus years. I think it’s time. I think it’s time. I think it’s time for strong men to show that they can support strong women in leadership positions, including the president of the United States. It’s just about time. It’s just about time.So everything about this week has been great except one thing. Now, I mean, everything’s been great. Until I joined the ticket, I was under the radar screen and Donald Trump wasn’t saying anything bad about me. I mean, he wasn’t threatened by me, so he didn’t have to say anything bad about me. But as soon as I got onto the ticket, Donald Trump had to come up with something to blast me about. So let me tell you what he said. The morning after I accepted the nomination of our party, the oldest party in the world, the Democratic Party, to be vice presidential nominee, Donald Trump said about me, ‘That Kaine, he was a lousy governor of New Jersey.’ I mean, I guess I was a lousy governor of New Jersey. I mean, I don’t have the thick skin that Hillary Clinton has built up during the campaign, so that kind of affected me. I was kind of feeling bad about it, and then I realized, wait a minute, I was never governor of New Jersey. I’ve never lived in New Jersey.But look, you’ve got to give Donald a break. He’s new to this thing. So 50 states, and Virginia is different than New Jersey. I mean, okay, so he doesn’t understand much; this whole thing is a big civics lesson for him. But he wants to be president, so go figure. I mean, go figure.We have been on this tour because what we want to do is talk about something really important: how to make sure that our economy grows and […] for a few, but for everybody. Now, you all […] this. Hillary Clinton and I both grew up in small business families. She’ll probably talk about her dad’s business, a drapery and printing fabric factory in Chicago. I grew up working in my dad’s manufacturing business, an ironworker-organized union shop in the stockyards of Kansas City — welding and ironworking. And it was five employees in a bad year, eight employees in a good year, plus my mom, plus my brothers and me. The old thing, if you’re in a family business, if there’s an order that has to go out then the kids are working on weekends or the kids are coming in on holidays or summers, and that’s what we did. So we come out of a small business background, though, and that’s where jobs get created. And we’re here to talk about — in Youngstown and in Pennsylvania earlier today and yesterday — how to grow the economy for all.And this is — on the economy, this thing is super simple. Super simple. Do you guys want […] a ‘you’re fired’ president or a ‘you’re hired’ president? I thought so. I thought that would be the answer. I mean, you know that Trump’s the ‘you’re fired’ guy. These are the two words that he is most known for. And I’ve got a prediction: after this whole campaign is over and after Donald Trump has lost and after people have forgotten everything about the race he ran, the two words they will remember about Donald Trump is, ‘You’re fired!’Hillary has been just laying out the details and talking about a ‘you’re hired’ economy, a job-growth economy. So it’s skills training, and it’s tax reform. Right now we have a tax code that loves investors and hates workers. We’ve got to flip that around. I like investors; that’s great. But we’ve got to love workers as much or more, and that’s what she’s talking about.We have to promote manufacturing. We’ve got to promote research — this great innovation. We have to promote — I mean, what about, like, wages? I mean, a minimum wage so you’re not under the poverty level. Or what about the radical notion that women should make the same salary and wages as men?One of the best lines in my opinion that — from Hillary’s speech the other night — she had a lot of great lines, but one I really liked because I’m kind of a — look, I was a mayor, I was a city council person, I was a governor. I kind of like the details about things. You know, it’s not just pie in the sky. You’ve got to tell people how you’ll do it. And Hillary Clinton said the other night, ‘I’ve got a lot of plans with some details to it. I feel like I ought to tell you what I’m going to do.’ And some give me grief about that, but if it’s your kid or your business, it’s not just details. It’s kind of a big deal. Right? I mean, you’re entitled to know what your president wants to do before you cast a vote in the ballot box, and that’s one of the things that I love about Hillary Clinton. The details matter.If you want to, go home and go on hillaryclinton.com, and you can see how she’ll make college debt-free, and how she’ll invest $10 billion to regrow advanced manufacturing, and how she’ll make sure that we combat bad trade deals and only accept trade deals if they’re really good for American workers, and how we’ll get to pay equity, and how we’ll raise the minimum wage. You go on that web page, you will know how she’ll pay for it and how we’ll benefit by it. And that’s what a presidential candidate ought to do.On the other hand, on the Trump side, he doesn’t give any details, folks. You’re not getting any details. I mean, when he tells you, ‘We’re going to be rich,’ and you ask why and he just says, ‘believe me.’ Or, ‘We’re going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, believe me.’ Well, wait a minute. ‘Believe me. We’re going to defeat — believe me.’ ‘Don’t worry, there’s nothing suspicious in my tax returns, believe me,’ Now, I know something about Ohio folks. I know you ain’t gullible.Do you really think that there’s nothing wrong with his tax returns? How about this: Do you think Donald Trump, if he wants to be president, should do what every presidential candidate in modern history has done and show his tax returns to the American public? Absolutely. Because what we’ve seen, and the convention laid this out, is Donald Trump has said ‘believe me’ to a lot of people. Now, he’s saying it in 2016 to the American voters.But let’s just go back before the election. He said ‘believe me’ to a bunch of contractors who have done work for him, and then he stiffed them on paying their bills. He said ‘believe me’ to a bunch of employees at his companies, and then he outsourced their jobs and laid them off. He said ‘believe me’ to retirees who gave him money because they wanted to live in a condo community in Florida, and then they ended up losing their money, they didn’t get their condos, and Trump walks away with a lot of dough. He said ‘believe me’ to thousands of students of Trump U. and what did they get? They lost their dough, and they got a certificate that wasn’t worth the paper it was printed on. When Donald Trump says ‘believe me’ and you believe him, you’re going to get hurt. You’re going to get hurt.And I just think we are too great a nation to put it in the hands — to put it in the hands of a slick-talking, self-promoting, empty-promising, one-man wrecking crew. We just can’t do it. we just can’t do it. So can I ask you, is there anybody here in this place who believes Donald Trump? The guy who co-wrote his autobiography says about Donald Trump recently, ‘Lying is second nature to him.’ So when he says ‘Believe me,’ I got this question — well, here’s my attitude: I ain’t believing you. I ain’t believing one word. Not one word, folks. Not one word. Not one word. Not one word. Not one word. Not one word.Not one — but we can believe somebody who has been about helping others since she was a teenager, a Midwestern Methodist Church kid growing up inspired by a wonderful youth pastor in her church in suburban Chicago who opened up the fact that in this broad world, there are a lot of folks who need a voice, who need a friend, who need a hand. And from that early moment, Hillary Clinton has been battling, and battling hard, for families and kids, long before she was in office. Long before she was in office.So I said to you, do you want a ‘you’re hired’ president or a ‘you’re fired’ president? And you answered right. But I’m going to bring up Hillary Clinton now and say the real issue is– the real issue is, with Donald Trump, you get a ‘me first’ president. With Hillary Clinton you get a ‘families and children first’ president. And Ohio, I know how you’re going to pick. We got work to do.. Let’s bring a warm Ohio welcome to the next president of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton!”HILLARY CLINTON:“Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you all! Thank you! I got to tell you, it is so great, so great being back here with you. I am excited about our bus trip, which started in Philadelphia, and we’ve gone across Pennsylvania, and now we’re in the great state of Ohio, starting in the Mahoning Valley! I apologize for us being late. We ran into a lot of thunderstorms, and it slowed us down. I really appreciate all of you waiting. It means the world to us to be here with you tonight. And there’s a big overflow crowd, and I understand they can hear us, and I want to thank them for being here as well.I want to thank Glenn Johnson and Robert Morales for being up here to introduce us to the stage. I am very proud to have the support and the endorsement of the UAW. I’m also very pleased to see our long-time friend, your former governor, Ted Strickland, a decent, hard-working, committed man who I hope you will send to the United States Senate in November. I appreciate State Senator Joe Schiavoni, and Joe, we do want that pizza. We need that pizza.And finally, I got to tell you, I am just the biggest fan of your congressman, Tim Ryan. How many of you saw him speak at the Democratic Convention? Wasn’t he terrific? Tim and I have a lot in common. I started the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate when I was there. He has led the House of Representatives Manufacturing Caucus. We are both commit to bringing manufacturing back so that there is a real path to the middle class for people who help to actually make things in America again.Tim and I also share a love for hot sauce. And he told me there would be one up here, but Tim, somebody got to it. It’s gone. So I’m going to hold you to it. I understand there’s kind of a special hot sauce that’s made right here. Right? Hot peppers! […] Yes, I want to try that. I told Tim some years ago that when Bill ran for President in 1992, I read an article which said that if you ate hot peppers, it would build your immune system. I figured, well, it’s worth a try. I started heating hot peppers back in ’92. I’m still eating them. And I’m still standing. And I’m still ready to go to the White House!Now, we’re on this bus tour to highlight what our plans are to create more good jobs and raise incomes. And we wanted to come to Pennsylvania and Ohio because these are two states where people still make things, where people believe that it’s possible to be a builder, to make a contribution, to have a good life for your family. So we’ve been visiting factories. We’ve been talking to folks, getting ideas. And here’s what I think. I think that if you agree that our major challenge economically is to create more good-paying jobs with rising incomes and good benefits so that more people in America — right here in the Mahoning Valley, across Ohio, and across our country — have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead, which is the basic bargain of America that joined this campaign.I started that Manufacturing Caucus back in the Senate because I represented New York. And in Upstate New York — some of you know because you may have traveled through there — we had a lot of hard-working people who got caught up in technology, with automation, with jobs being moved out of our country. And they deserved better. And we began to put together plans, and that’s exactly what I will do as your president. We’re going to have the biggest job creation program since World War II. And we’re going to invest in infrastructure, we’re going to build and maintain our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. There is so much good work to be done in America. And it’s not just what we can see; not just the physical infrastructure, which is critically important. We need a new electric grid. If we’re going to be creating renewable energy, we’ve got to be able to distribute it. We need to make sure every person, every home, every business in America has access to broadband. Internet connectivity that will give them a chance to compete and win in the economy.I said in Harrisburg Pennsylvania last night that that’s what I wanted to do, and I told folks that teachers had told me, just recently, there was a big national survey of teachers — and you know I love teachers. And so these teachers that were telling me that after they did this survey, they found that about 70 percent of our nation’s teachers assign homework that requires kids to use the Internet. And I see some teachers’ heads nodding. Well, that makes perfect sense because we want our kids prepared for the future. They’re going to live in the information age, and goodness knows, it’s going to be moving even faster.That’s the good news. The bad news is, there are 5 million kids in America who cannot access the Internet from their homes when they’re supposed to be doing their homework. And there are parts of every state — because when I finished speaking last night, I went out, as I will later, and meet everybody, shake your hands — and some of the people there told me, they said, you have no idea how bad it is in places in Pennsylvania. We still have dial-up. A lot of places, we can’t get access. That is unacceptable. It is 2016. We are going to finish providing broadband Internet connectivity to every place in America.We are also going to invest in advanced manufacturing. I can’t wait until I get to work with Tim Ryan and Ted Strickland and Sherrod Brown about how we’re going to do this. We’re going to invest, we’re going to work the public and the private sectors to make sure, number one, that businesses get the support they need in order to have the kind of plant and equipment that will enable them to be more competitive. We are going to make sure that people have the skills that they can immediately put to work.I am a strong believer is that, yes, it’s great to get a four year college education, and we’re going to make that debt free. But I don’t believe that a four year college education should be the only path for people having a good middle class job, and a future that gives them and their kids better opportunities. We were in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and we were meeting with the management and the Steelworkers Union, a unionized plant, and they helped to train their people. And then their workers are making, on average, $70,000 a year. I’m telling you, we can do this. Because there are now million jobs in America that are not being filled. We don’t have enough machinists, tool and die workers, welders, coaters. We need more skilled people in the trades. I’ve got a plan to encourage businesses to pay to train people, and to support union apprenticeship programs so that we get those skills and get ready to make a good future.And, you know, I believe strongly that some nation is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I want it to be us. Because there are millions of new jobs and businesses if we do this. So we are going to grow the economy. I’m going to invest $10 billion in manufacturing communities like those in the Mahoning Valley. And I’m going to do it by defending American workers. We are not going to let Republican governors and Republican legislatures undermine the right to join a union, undermine the right to bargain collectively. I believe Right to Work is wrong for America, and I will stand against that effort.And we are going to say no to unfair trade deals. I’m going to appoint a special trade prosecutor to go after companies and countries that undercut our businesses and are unfair to our workers. We’re going to enforce rules of origin. We saved the American auto industry from a certain demise. And I’ll tell you, it was the Democrats who did it, wasn’t it? And it was the right thing to do. The American auto industry just had its best year ever last year. Well, we’re going to keep that going. And the way we are is, we’re going to stand up for our companies and our workers, and we’re not going to let China continue to dump cheap steel into the American market.Another way we’re going to grow the economy is by supporting small business. You heard Tim say his dad was a small businessman. So was mine. My father had a small business that printed fabric for draperies. He had a — what we called a print plant. It was a kind of low ceilinged, kind of dark place in Chicago, with two really long tables. And the way you did this — because I helped him when I had to, and he needed the help — you would take the fabric, you’d put it on the long table, then you’d take what’s called a silkscreen, and you’d put it down, and then you’d take the paint — you’d pour it into the silkscreen, then you’d take the squeegee and you’d go from left to right, then you’d lift it up and you’d keep going down the table.I know how hard he worked. And I know how many opportunities that hard work gave my family. That’s why I take really personally what Donald Trump does to small businesses. This is not just a campaign talking point. This is personal. You know, because my dad did all that work — he would get contracts, he’d load the fabrics into the car, then he’d take them — he’d provide them to the hotel or the restaurant, the office — and then he expected to be paid. I mean, that’s the way we do business, isn’t it? I mean, my first job is I babysat. I expected to be paid. Every job I’ve had since, I expected to be paid after I did the job.Well, apparently Donald Trump thinks he’s immune from all of those rules and requirements. And so, person after person has come forward to say the same thing: I got the contract, I did the work, he wouldn’t pay me. I’m talking about plumbers and painters, glass installers, marble installers, all kinds of people. And then what happens is, you know, they do the work, they go to get paid — he or his minions say, no, we’re not going to pay you. And, you know, it’s a kind of — like, a shock — what do you mean you’re not going to pay me? They say, if you don’t like it, go sue us. Well, if you’re a small business person, you can’t afford to sue a guy who puts his name on big buildings all over the place, has a battalion of lawyers. This man has been sued 3,500 times. He plays the odds. ‘A lot of people won’t sue me. A lot of people will give up if they try. So maybe at the end we’ll have to pay them 50 cents, 30 cents on the dollar.’ That is so wrong, and it is something — it is something that people who have been treated like this are coming to the forefront to speak out about. Because, you know what? They don’t want America being treated by Donald Trump the way they were treated by Donald Trump.I looked it up: nearly 98 percent of businesses in Ohio are small business. So again, I take this personally. We’re going to help small business. We’re going to help get you more access to credit, cut red tape, remove obstacles so that small businesses can thrive. But we’re not only going to grow the economy, we’re going to make the economy fairer. Because the economy needs to work for everybody, not just those at the top. And we need to be doing everything we can to lift more people up. So we’re going to raise the national minimum wage. We’re going to make it a living wage that can produce a good, solid, middle-class life.And the fastest way to increase family incomes is to make sure women get paid for the work that we do. Now, I’ll tell you, this is not a woman’s issue. It’s a family issue. If you have a working mother, wife, daughter, or sister, it’s your issue. And so therefore, finally, we’re going to put this right.So I’m excited about what we’re going to do to create jobs, raise incomes, grow the economy, make it fair. And we’re going to pay for everything, I’m telling you, and I’m telling you how I’m going to pay for it. It’s pretty simple. We’re going to increase taxes on corporations, Wall Street, and the wealthy in America.Now, that is not because I’m against success. We don’t resent success in America. But it’s because that’s where the money is. 90 percent of the income gains have gone to the top 1 percent of Americans. So it’s like that movie. You want to know what we’re going to do? We’re going to Follow the Money, and the money leads to the super wealthy and corporations and Wall Street, who need to be paying for the benefits that they have received from living in the greatest country in the world.So as you can tell, I’m pretty excited. It may be late, but I’m really jazzed up about what we’re going to do. And I don’t think the stakes could be higher. Tim told you some of the reasons why Donald Trump is offering empty promises and totally at odds with what he’s done in business, how he’s treated people. Well, let’s just take one more example. He talks about let’s make America great, right? Well, he talks about putting America first, right? Well, then why does he make Trump suits in Mexico instead of Brooklyn, Ohio? Why does he make furniture in Turkey instead of Cleveland? Why does he make barware in Slovenia instead of Jackson, Ohio?Well, if you saw your great senator, Sherrod Brown, at the Democrat convention — he was great. He said he bought his suit not far from where he lives in Cleveland, bought his tie in Ohio, bought his shirt in Ohio. Now, I don’t want to stir up any rivalry with Pennsylvania but — my husband is wearing a shirt that was made in Reading, Pennsylvania. So if we’re going to make America great again, Donald Trump ought to start making things in America again.This is going to be a very intense campaign, right? One hundred days from today, people are going to go vote. Tim and Ann and Bill and I and everyone working with us, we’re going to work our hearts out, because I have to tell you this is not a normal election. Donald Trump is not a normal presidential candidate. Somebody who attacks everybody has something missing. I don’t know what it is. I’m not going to get into that. But yesterday he attacked a distinguished Marine general, John Allen. He attacked the distinguished father of a soldier who sacrificed himself for his unit, Captain Khan. He’s attacked immigrants and women. He’s attacked people with disabilities. It’s a long list, my friends. I don’t know, maybe he doesn’t have anything positive to say.But when you run for president, it’s kind of like a giant job interview. If you were interviewing somebody to hire and that person came in to see you and that person spent all of his time insulting and scapegoating and blaming other people, and then got up and left your office, you’d be kind of wondering what does that person do. I think it is fair to say he is temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief. And as I said Thursday night, someone who can get provoked by a tweet should not be responsible for nuclear weapons.So here’s what I’m asking you. We’re going to be back. We’ll be in the Mahoning Valley. We’ll be all over Ohio. Because I want people to understand what the choice is and how it will affect you, your job, your future. And just yesterday, the Republican economist who advised Senator John McCain when he ran for president in 2008, he looked at the plans that I’ve put forth and he’s looked at what Donald Trump has said he wants to do, and here’s what he concluded: Under my plans, America will create at least 10 million new jobs in the first four years. And this is not me saying it. This is not me saying it. It’s not even a Democrat saying it. But then he goes on and says under Trump’s plans America will lose 3.5 million jobs. So this is serious business. Yes, don’t boo. Vote.So here’s what I’m asking. I am asking for your help in this campaign. I want you to talk to your friends, your neighbors, your family members. I know that there are people here in the Mahoning Valley who think they want to support Trump. I just want you to try to have a conversation with them. I want you to ask them please to look at the facts. I want you to ask them to look at the stories that are coming out in the press every day about people who were stiffed, mistreated. I want you to look at the stories of all the foreign workers that he hires. I want you to look at where he makes the things he sells. And then I want you to ask your friends and neighbors, ‘Is this somebody who really cares about the people of the Mahoning Valley, the people of this great state?’And I want you to join the campaign. Here’s what you can do: Text JOIN, J-O-I-N, to 47246 or go to hillaryclinton.com. And by the way, we are hiring organizers in Ohio, so if you’re interested, go to hillaryclinton.com and look for where we’re hiring, because we are going to reach out. We’re going to register 3 million more people. We are going to turn everybody out to vote.Because like I said, I want you to know what my plans are as your president and I want you to hold me accountable. I’m not going to sit in the White House. I’m going to keep traveling around America. I’m going to come back to the Mahoning Valley. I’m going to sit down; I’m going to ask you what’s working, what’s not working. As you heard in the convention, when I tell you I will try to help you, you can count on it, because I will do everything I possibly can to deliver results for you.So I know the hour is late. I know you have been incredibly patient. But I am so excited to be back here. I will be back. My team will be back. And we want you to be part of winning this election and moving our country into the future with optimism. Thank you.”","Clinton Official"
"24",2016-07-30,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on building a 21st century economy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at a rally in Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaTIM KAINE:“Hey, Pittsburgh! You guys look great! One of the hard things about being the VP nominee is they make you follow Mark Cuban. I mean, that guy is great. Give it up for your native. Give it up for your homeboy.I am so happy to be here in Pittsburgh. I’m Tim Kaine, Senator of Virginia, and I am so proud that Hillary Clinton has asked me to be her running mate in a race where we’re going to make history for this country, and then after November 8 when we win, we’re going to make history every day by doing great things for Americans. Give it up for Hillary Clinton!And I’ve just been doing this little bus tour for the last couple days with Hillary Clinton and President Clinton and my wife Anne. You know, it’s just a regular week in the Kaine household. We have been having a spectacular time. And I just can’t tell you how proud I am to be on this stage with Hillary, with President Clinton, and my wife Anne.I’ve had a blessed life. Grew up in a manufacturing household. My dad ran an organized ironworking shop in the stockyards of Kansas City. I was a missionary in Honduras, civil rights lawyer for 17 years in Richmond, Virginia, and then I was a city councilman and mayor. I honor all the elected officials here tonight, especially our local guys — city councilmen, mayors, members of county commissions. If you’re doing work at the local level, you understand folks’ heart. And I give all of these folks here great praise. We got a great cheering section behind.And I’ll just say one other thing about what an honor it is for me. I encouraged Hillary Clinton in April of 2014, ‘Please get in and run for president in 2016.’ And I did that because I knew it would be a challenging time and she would be the best-qualified person to be president of this country, absolutely.But I was also struck as we stood on the stage in Philadelphia — and I’ll tell you, Pennsylvania showed a lot of hospitality, did a great job at the convention. As I stood on the stage at that history-making moment, when the balloons were falling and we realized that a major party had nominated a woman to be president for the first time in the history of this nation, and I thought about every strong woman who has supported me during my life and during 22 years and eight electoral campaigns, including my fantastic wife Anne, Virginia’s former Secretary of Education. And I realized this is an election that can not only make history for the country and do good things, but it gives every strong man in this country to show that they can support strong women leadership just as much as strong women have supported us for hundreds of years.Only one bad thing has happened to me since I got on this ticket, folks, and I’m just going to be honest. As soon as I was part of the ticket, Donald Trump had to figure out a name to call me. I’d been skating under the radar. He wasn’t saying anything about me. And then I end up being on the ticket, and I take the nomination, and he gives a press conference the next morning and he said that Tim Kaine was a lousy governor of New Jersey. I mean, when you’re super-sensitive like me, I kind of felt bad. But then I realized, wait a minute. I never was governor of New Jersey. I’ve never lived in New Jersey. But look, you got to give Donald Trump a break. He’s new at this — the civics, the 50 states. New Jersey is different than Virginia. I mean, come on. What do you expect? What do you expect?So here’s the deal. We’re on this bus tour through Pennsylvania and Ohio to talk about how to create an economy that is going to grow and that’s going to provide opportunities for all, not just for a few. And Mark, the way you said it — you’re not going to inspire entrepreneurs and grow jobs by terrifying people; you’re going to do it by inspiring people. I mean, it can’t be put any better than that. It can’t be put any better than that.And if you boil it all down between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, it comes down to a pretty simple question. A pretty simple question. Do you want a ‘You’re fired’ president or a ‘You’re hired’ president? I mean, we know Donald Trump is the ‘You’re fired’ guy, and long after this campaign is over and after he’s lost and after we’ve forgotten everything about the Trump campaign, we will remember these two words, ‘You’re fired.’ We will remember those two words.But what’s so great about Hillary is she’s laid it out in pretty clear detail, this is what I want to do to get this economy growing, and growing for all. And you’re going to hear her talk about that. It’s growing the skills so that there can be these great new entrepreneurs and great new workers, and making sure that people have the skills, are treated fairly with wages that are fair and benefits that are fair, and pay equity for women, and paid family leave. If we’re going to honor workers, we got to have policies that honor workers. Right?We’ve got to have a tax code that is fair to workers. We have a tax code now that loves investors and punishes workers. No, you got to have a tax code that — I want to love investors, but we got to love workers, too. And you got to have tax reform to do that. Advanced manufacturing research. Infrastructures to build roads and ports and buildings, to hire people, and then raise our platform for success.You go to hillaryclinton.com, one click, you can find out how she’s going to do it all specifically — how she’ll do it, how she’ll pay for it, how we’ll benefit. Sometimes people have criticized her for the details, and what she said the other night is really important. She said, ‘Well, look. Some people, they don’t like the details. But if it’s your kid or if it’s your business, it ain’t a detail. It’s a big deal.’ And that’s really important. And that’s really important.Now, I’ll just say this about Donald Trump and then I’m going to introduce our next president. So Hillary’s got plans. Hillary’s got plans. Donald Trump, no plans. Not a single plan. He will tell you, we’re all going to be rich, but no plan there. He just says, ‘Believe me.’ ‘We’re going to beat ISIS, believe me.’ ‘We’re going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it.’ ‘How you going to do it?’ ‘Believe me.’ ‘Nothing’s funny in tax returns, believe me.’Hey, by the way, does anybody here think there’s nothing funny about Donald Trump’s tax returns? I mean, does anybody here think Donald Trump has been paying his fair share of taxes? Does anybody here think that Donald Trump has given a lot of money to charity? Does anybody here think Donald Trump should do what every modern presidential candidate has done and release his tax returns so we can make our own decisions?Well, the problem with the ‘Believe me’ is that there’s an awful lot of stories about people who did believe Donald Trump — contractors who believed him and never got paid; employees who believed him and saw their jobs outsourced, and they got laid off; students at Trump University, who not only believed him, but put a whole lot of money in his hands, only to end up with a certificate that wasn’t worth the paper that it was written on; retirees that believed him, gave him their life savings, bought a condo for retirement, only to get no condo and lose all their money. People have believed Donald Trump, and when people have believed Donald Trump, they’ve ended up getting hurt.So when Donald Trump looks you in the face and says, ‘Believe me,’ is there anybody in here who will believe Donald Trump? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. We cannot afford to put a nation as great as ours into the hands of a slick-talking, empty-promising, self-promoting, one-man wrecking crew. We just can’t do it. We just can’t do it.So what we have in Hillary Clinton is a seasoned public servant who has gotten results for people her whole life. She’s not a ‘me firster.’ She’s a ‘families and kids firster.’ And she has battled from long before she got into public office to make a meaningful difference, whether it’s getting health care for those who went into the buildings after 9/11 to save the victims of a terrorist attack and making sure she could get health care, or whether it’s battling for 8 million American children who have health insurance because of Hillary Clinton. She would never stand up and say, ‘Believe me.’ She believes in you. And together with you, we’re going to put a great president in and make history.Please welcome, a warm welcome, Hillary Clinton.”HILLARY CLINTON:“Hello, Pittsburgh! Wow! Thank you so much! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you very, very much. Wow! It is so great being back here in Pittsburgh with all of you, and I can’t tell you how happy I am to be here with a Pittsburgh native who worked hard for everything that he has made and has helped a lot of people along the way. What he exemplifies is the American Dream, but he understands the dream gets bigger the more you share it. And I want to thank Mark Cuban for being here!I loved hearing his stories. I especially loved everyone learning what he did when he became successful and sold companies. He shared. He shared the benefits with everybody who helped him be a success. He said, when he sold the company, the second one, for a big, big amount of money, he shared it with everybody, made 300 millionaires, including people who were working at minimum wage, because they helped him be a success. And Mark is right. I want to do what I can to make it possible for more people who help their businesses succeed share in the profits because when we share, we grow. And you know what I believe: We are stronger together, and that’s how we’re going to make it in America!Now, I want to thank your elected officials who have been on this pre-program and thank them for their support because I am really looking forward to working with them. They’re bringing people together on behalf of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County and Western Pennsylvania. So thanks to Congressman Mike Doyle. Thanks to Mayor Bill Peduto, thanks for Allegheny County Executor Rich Fitzgerald, Councilman Dan Gilman, and Mayor John Fetterman from Braddock PA.Now, as you heard from Tim Kaine, we are on a bus tour and we are having a great time because you get to drive through Pennsylvania, which really is one of the most beautiful places on Earth — and I don’t say it because it’s the first time I’ve seen it. My father was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania — and every summer of our lives we drove from outside of Chicago where we lived to Scranton. And because we did it every year and a lot of times also during Christmas, we took different routes. So I was in Pittsburgh a lot. And my dad and my brother went to Penn State so I was in State College at lot.So for me this is really a sentimental tour through Pennsylvania, and it gives me such personal joy because I love this commonwealth and I know that a lot of good things are happening here because people are working together. But we’re going to make more good things happen. We’re going to have a coordinated, specific set of plans to create more jobs right here in Pennsylvania, to give more people a chance to fulfill their own dreams, to lift up the incomes of hardworking people, to create what I view as an opportunity society, where if you do your part you can get ahead and stay ahead. That’s the basic bargain of America and we’re going to keep our end of it.Now, as you heard Tim say, I have laid out plans in this campaign. I have this old-fashioned idea that basically I’m being interviewed to be hired. This is a giant job interview. And I’m hoping I am hired and the other guy is fired. But I’m not asking you — I’m not asking you to vote for me just because I show up and just because I tell you you’re supposed to believe in me and you’re supposed to just count on me to come up with something that I don’t tell you about beforehand. I’m not doing that. I’m laying out my plans in this campaign.And here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to, in the first 100 days, break through the gridlock in Washington and have the biggest infrastructure and jobs program that we’ve had since World War II. We’re going to be investing in our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. But we’re also going to be investing in a new electric grid that can then take advantage and distribute all the new, clean, renewable energy we’re going to be producing.And we’re going to do something else. We are going to finish the job of providing high-speed, affordable broadband internet connectivity to every single home and business in America. I was in Harrisburg last night and I told the crowd there — beautiful night, place called the Broad Street Market. It was just magical. And I told them we were going to do this on broadband. And then I said I was talking to a bunch of teachers, and they just did a survey, a national survey — I love teachers. I could tell you something about every one of my public school teachers starting in kindergarten all the way through 12th grade.But I was talking to them and they said 70 percent of the teachers in America assign homework to our kids that requires the kids to go on the internet. Now, I think that makes sense. Just like Mark was a pioneer in using the internet to deliver services, we want our kids to know how to use it and how to learn from it. And who knows? They may grow up and follow in Mark’s footsteps or whatever the next generation is.But here’s the kicker: 5 million kids in our country don’t now have access to the internet in a way that enables them to do the homework they’re asked to do. That’s 5 million kids who are being left out. And after I finished saying that in Harrisburg I was walking the line, as I will after I talked here, meeting people, shaking hands, and one of the men I met said, ‘You know, that’s only half of it. We still have places in Pennsylvania,’ he told me, ‘where our only option is dial-up.’ Right? I see heads nodding. How are we going to be a competitive 21st century economy and take on and win in the world if we can’t even get broadband, if we can’t even get internet connectivity to every single home and business? And we’re going to do that.Now, in addition to growing the economy we are going to make it fairer. And this is a big deal too, because I want everybody to be lifted up. I want everybody to benefit from their hard work the way Mark has done with his businesses. There’s a couple of things we can do at the government level as well as encourage more businesses to follow Mark’s example. We can raise the national minimum wage so that more people have a chance to get themselves out of poverty and into the middle class. And we can do more to help small businesses because that is where more of the new jobs are created, so let’s do more to get them the credit they need and get rid of the red tape and the bureaucratic obstacles.But you know the fastest way to raise incomes in America. It’s pretty simple. Let’s finally guarantee equal pay for women’s work. Now, I’ve got to add, I think most of you know this, but this is not a woman’s issue. It isn’t. Because here’s what I’d ask you: If you have a working mom, wife, sister, or daughter, it’s your issue. It’s a family issue. And when women are shortchanged, families are shortchanged and the economy is shortchanged.And the other thing we’re going to do, we’re going to make sure that we pay for everything I’m proposing, everything from paid family leave to preschool for kids. We’re going to make sure we pay for it. Because I want you to know exactly what I’m going to do and exactly how I’m going to pay for it, and I am going to go where the money is. You know that old movie Follow the Money? Well, 90 percent of the income gains have gone to the top 1 percent, so we’re going to try to get those who’ve been successful — sorry, Mark — we’re going to try to get those who have been successful to help us fund what will make America even more successful and create more millionaires and more billionaires, more entrepreneurs, more success stories. You see, I am so excited in part because I’ve seen what Pittsburgh has done. I told you I used to come to Pittsburgh all the time, so I have had a firsthand look at the way this great American city has reinvented itself. It didn’t happen by people insulting each other. It didn’t happen by folks pointing fingers and demeaning one another. It happened because people got together and said, ‘Wait a minute, we love this place.’ Right?So how do we reimagine and reinvent Pittsburgh for the future? Let’s not just keep looking backwards. Let’s look forwards. How do we create more jobs? How do we bring young people back? During the primary I was at Carnegie Mellon, and I was knocked over by what I saw going on there.So I get excited. I want us to really believe that America’s best years are ahead of us, but to understand the only way we’re going to make that a reality is by working together and recognizing that we’ve got to do more to make sure everybody is brought alone. Education is still the door to opportunity, but it’s not just one kind of education. You know I believe we need to start with preschool education, because I want every child prepared to be successful when that child gets to school.And I want to be sure that in elementary and secondary school we’re providing the tools that kids will need to make the most out of their own talents and ambition. And so let’s make sure we’ve got computer science and coding and technology programs in our high schools again.And I have a plan to make community college free so that more people can get two-year degrees to get a good job.There are about a million jobs right now that aren’t being filled, and a lot of those jobs are in the trades. A lot of those jobs require skills. We are going to have a shortage of machinists and welders and tool-and-die makers, and these are good jobs and I want us to start respecting the work that people do to build America again.And then we’re going to do more with apprenticeship programs. I’m going to offer a tax credit so that businesses will provide apprenticeship programs that will pay, that will pay young people to learn the skills that will give them a path to a new job. And I’m going to support unions that are already providing apprenticeship programs for young people.And we are going to make public colleges and universities debt-free so that every single young person can afford to go. And then we are going to give you ways to refinance your student debt to get the cost down. It’s just not right. Donald Trump gets to take bankruptcy. American families and students get stuck. Well, we’re going to change that. We’re going to give you a way to pay less because we’re going to lower interest rates, pay it as a percentage of your income, put a date certain when your obligations end; and if you do public service like teaching or policing or firefighting, we’re going to forgive your college debt.Now, I’m excited by this because I have seen it work. I know that if we make up our minds and roll up our sleeves, we will create these jobs and we will unleash a whole new generation of entrepreneurs. I want young people to feel like they can start their own businesses, they can take chances. I really appreciated Mark saying, you know what, he didn’t succeed 100 percent of the time, I don’t know anybody who has. But you learn by trying, and I want to encourage more Americans not just to dream again but try again.And I want people to know that we can make things in America, because I believe that if we put our minds to it, we can do more in advanced manufacturing, clean energy technology. We can bring back some precision machining from Germany and Japan with a public-private partnership where we work to support manufacturers so that they can be competitive worldwide.Now, Donald Trump talks a big game about putting America first. But then you actually peel back the story and what do you find? He makes Trump shirts in Bangladesh, not Ashland, Pennsylvania. He makes Trump furniture in Turkey, not Freeburg, Pennsylvania. He makes Trump picture frames in India, not Bristol, Pennsylvania. And I just have to point out, my husband is wearing a shirt that was made right here in Pennsylvania, in Reading — Reading, Pennsylvania. And when we were packing for the bus tour and he said, ‘Well, what am I supposed to wear,’ I said, ‘Well, I don’t know. It’s sort of bus tour casual.’ And so he’s going through his closet, and this morning in the hotel in Harrisburg he’s putting this shirt on. He goes, ‘You know what? This shirt was made in Reading, Pennsylvania, and you will not believe this, at a company called ‘Bill’s.’So we have a very stark choice in this election. It really is about the difference between pulling together, working together, making the future better together, and living with fear and anxiety and the kinds of insults, the bigotry, the blustering and bullying that we’re seeing from the other side.Now, I know because I’ve had the great experience of observing presidents up close — and working for four years for President Obama as Secretary of State — and even working with Republican presidents. I may not have agreed with what their positions were, but I will tell you this: I’ve had the great privilege of observing presidents, listening to them, understanding what they’re trying to achieve. And even where our positions diverge, I have never doubted that they were trying to figure out, in their own minds based on their own experiences, what was right for America. We’ve never had someone run for president who is so manifestly temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.And I understand what he’s doing. There are a lot of people in our country who are frustrated. They feel like maybe the economy has passed them by, that their government doesn’t help them, that nobody is listening to them, nobody cares about them. I get that. That’s why I said in my convention speech I want to be a president for all Americans — Republicans, independents Democrats, people who vote for me, people who don’t vote for me.Because I think we all are in this together, and I know that if we decide we’re going to set some big goals for America, we’ll achieve them because that’s what we’ve always done. And so when I think about the next 100 days of this campaign here in Pennsylvania, I will be doing everything I can to reach out and meet as many people as possible. I will go everywhere that Tim and I and Bill and Ann can reach. I will make sure that you know what I stand for, what I want to do, because I want you to hold me accountable. I want you to say, ‘I came and heard her.’”AUDIENCE: “Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!”HILLARY CLINTON: “Because I need your ideas — not just during the campaign but afterwards. I want us to begin a conversation that keeps going. As president I won’t be stuck in the White House. I’m going to be traveling around America having meetings, listening, trying to learn what more we can do.But I can’t get there without your help. I am inviting you to join this campaign. Please, if you will, text JOIN, J-O-I-N, to 47246 or go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up, be part of this campaign. And by the way, we are hiring organizers in Allegheny County and across Pennsylvania right now.I want to end where Mark took us, because as I was backstage listening to him — I’ve watched him on Shark Tank. And I’ve watched him very respectfully try to figure out how can I help somebody. If I can’t, I can’t. But if I can, here’s what I’d like to do. And I’ve really admired that, Mark. I really did. Because we’ve got to have that attitude in our country again. How are we going to help each other, lift each other up, have each other’s back? This country is really a place that people dream and build together. With us in Philadelphia were so many wonderful people who told their stories. If you saw them during the convention, you heard the bravery, the determination.That, to me, is the best of America. Whatever position one holds, whatever kind of background one has, getting up every day trying to make the most out of your own life, trying to get your family to go through barriers and obstacles to make the most out of theirs, reaching out to neighbors, being part of this dream that we all share — the American dream is not limited, my friends. The American dream is as big as we make it. And with your help, we’re going to make it bigger than ever. Let’s go win in November. Thank you and God bless you.”","Clinton Official"
"25",2016-07-30,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks contrasting 100 day jobs plan with Trump’s record of outsourcing in Johnstown, Pennsylvania","Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at Johnstown Wire Technologies, a factory in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. TIM KAINE:“How you guys doing? So good to be here at Johnstown Wire, and thank you for welcoming us. I want to thank Jim and Ron. And I had a great chance to visit with Nick a little bit, and heard about what you all do. It is a treat for us to bring our bus tour here. You can see my voice has gotten a little hoarse this week. I don’t know why. It’s not like I’ve been doing a lot of talking. I want to say a special thanks to Leo Gerard, the head of the steel workers. Leo, it’s so good to have you here.The largest steelworker union in the international, the largest […] local, is in Newport News, Virginia. Local […], which is the manufacturers who build the most complicated things on planet Earth — nuclear aircraft carriers and subs. So we’re glad to have our steel workers there in Virginia, Leo.This has been an incredible week. And my wife, Anne, up until a couple of days ago was the Secretary of Education in Virginia, but she stepped down to campaign full time so we can get Hillary Clinton elected President. The week has been amazing, and I’m just really humbled and honored to be part of this ticket. Being asked by a public servant who is as superb as Hillary Clinton, to join her on this ticket and to do good things for the economy, to grow it so that all benefit, to make us strong in the world with stronger alliances to build a community of respect — It’s deeply humbling.There has only been one bad thing about being asked to join this ticket. And I’ll just be blunt about it. Once I was on the ticket, Donald Trump had to decide how he was going to make fun of me. So he basically decided at a press conference a couple of days ago, it really hurt my feelings, by saying what a lousy governor of New Jersey I had been.When you work hard in public life, and then somebody trashes your record, you feel bad. I was feeling bad for a few minutes, and I thought, ‘Wait a minute, I wasn’t governor of New Jersey. I’ve never lived in New Jersey. I was governor of Virginia.’ So then I started to feel better. You’ve got — listen, you’ve got to give the guy a break. He’s new at this. He’s still getting the briefing memos on 50 states and New Jersey’s different than Virginia. So give him time, I guess, give him time. Well, look. I took this nomination a couple of days ago, and I talked about my own background, which makes me feel proud to be here. I was talking to Jim and Ron and Nick as we came in.I grew up in Kansas City, and my dad ran an iron-worker organized ironworking and welding shop in the stockyards of Kansas City. My mom was his best salesman. My brothers and I worked in a manufacturing business that is pretty similar to this, except a whole lot smaller. Five employees plus family and […], plus family in a good year, but I know the deep importance of manufacturing: the deep importance of cooperation between management and union labor. So that’s why I’m so glad to come here today.And we’re on this tour so that we can talk about the American Economy: to talk about manufacturing; to talk about the way to grow jobs and make sure everybody benefits from our economic growth, not just a few. And that’s why I admire Hillary so very, very much. She —No, please. please. Hillary also grew up in a small business family. You know, we were comparing notes. The businesses were different, but one thing’s the same if you grow up in a small business family. Everybody, it’s all hands on deck, just like this campaign.Everybody comes down and the kids come down. If you’ve got to get an order or if it’s a holiday or a weekend and something is needed, everybody gets pressed into service. And she learned those same values growing up in her family in suburban Chicago and she’s been living them for her entire career. And she’s got just about the best life partner that you could imagine if you’re trying to serve others. Please give a great round of applause to President Clinton.For all of us on stage and frankly for anybody who’s got their values straight, it’s not about title, it is not about money, it is not about prestige, it’s not about popularity it’s about what you can do to help folks out. And that’s why I’m so excited to be here on this tour with Hillary, Bill and my wife Anne.For us to just be sitting on a bus shooting the breeze with Hillary and Bill Clinton — I mean, I’ve got to tell you, I’m still sort of pinching myself. And yesterday — we have a boy in the Marines who deployed overseas earlier this week. And we were able to — and […] that Nick is a Marine — we were able to get him on the phone and talk to our running mates, and man that just blew him away. That’s something that he felt so good about many time zones away.But look, we’re here because the convention was great and Pennsylvania did a superb job. We think we know hospitality in Virginia, but Philly and Pennsylvania did a superb job.But this is the part of the campaign I like best, not in the suit but with the jacket off and with the tie off, just going out and pounding the pavement. 100 days from now and we are pounding the pavement to make sure we win. On this bus tour, which is in Pennsylvania and Ohio, we’re talking about creating jobs, raising wages and the leadership that we need to show in order to make that possible.In this county, you’ve got 125 to — 129 manufacturing businesses just like Johnstown Wire that employ nearly 4,000 people. And Hillary’s going to talk at some length about our ‘Make It in America’ plan that will invest $10 billion in communities just like Johnstown.We’ll put workers first, we’ll put their wages first, we’ll put their families first. We’ll reject trade agreements like the TPP that don’t meet the standards that they ought to meet.And we need to do something that has a direct tie to Johnstown Wire’s business, which is invest in infrastructure, so that everybody’s able to get around. We can have a power grid that works, we’ve got bridges that are solid, because these kinds of jobs and infrastructure hire people today and raise our platform of economic success down the road.This way to build the economy so that all benefit is just one of the few issues at stake in the campaign, but it’s really the most important one, because if we can build those ladders of success for every community and every industry and every region, then our country’s going to be very, very strong.We saw in Philadelphia this week a united Democratic Party. And look, for Dems that’s not always just an automatic. I will just be honest. We came in and there were challenges, because we are a family that doesn’t mind airing debates and having robust debates and there were challenges on Monday morning, but by Thursday night, when our candidate hit the stage, took the nomination and laid out her vision for the country, they saw the Democrats pull together behind a relentlessly upbeat and patriotic view of this country, right?And aren’t we all patriots and aren’t we all optimists?I think the vision we put on display was a sharp contrast from the darker and more twisted version that we saw in Cleveland and we like being the upbeat, positive people. We don’t sugarcoat stuff, we don’t whitewash challenges, but we know we can solve our challenges because of you.This election, the stakes are very clear and the stakes are very high. It’s a choice between a leader who’s been working her entire life on behalf of families and children or somebody who’s spent his entire life watching out for himself no matter who gets hurt. There’s a story that the campaign has told of a guy named Andrew Tesoro who’s an architect. You might have seen it — there’s a video and an ad, and the reason we mention him, he lives in New York but he’s been teaching over at Carnegie Mellon, so that’s why I wanted to mention him, Donald Trump hired him as an architect to design a clubhouse for one of his golf courses, that was a huge honor to him.He believed Donald Trump. He believed he could do good work for him, and he did. He honored his part of the bargain, he designed, and they built this clubhouse, this very nice place. But as he so often does, Donald decided, ‘Hey, I can stiff this guy.’ And even told him, ‘You know what, because you’re a nice guy, I’ll pay you half.’ You know, if he didn’t like him, he was going to pay him less than that.And Andrew couldn’t hire the […] lawyers to go after a big machine like the Trump machine. And so I guess he figured, well, I guess, probably can’t go after him. So maybe I’ll have to settle for half. But after he did that, Trump had second thoughts about paying him half. He bullied this guy, this small business owner, this entrepreneur, he threatened him, he said he’d tie him up in court forever, and so the guy basically had to settle for virtually zip when he had already done all of the work.He had already paid for all of his work, all of his folks, and all the entire project, and built the clubhouse that Trump gets to take advantage of and enjoy. This was a small business that took a punch because they believed Donald Trump. So when it comes to Trump there is, there are just too many stories like that, I talked about it at the convention the other night, so many people when they believed in him, they found out they got stiffed. And now he’s still saying, ‘Hey folks, believe me.’We’ve got a candidate who respects you enough to lay out a plan, here’s what I’ll do, here’s how I’ll do it. And I thought when of the best lines that Hillary said the other night was, ‘I’ve got details, but remembers when it’s about your own kid, or it’s about your own business, it’s not a detail, it’s a big deal, and you ought to have to tell people, what you’re going to do.’But Trump just says, ‘Look, believe me. Trust me.’ And we’d be fools to do it. I can’t help but think what would have happened if my dad’s business had been trying to do work with seven or eight employees for a guy like Trump, who just felt like he could use them and then just kick them aside, I wouldn’t have the opportunities I have today had my Dad dealt with people like that when he was running his iron-working shop.So the last thing I’ll say before I bring up the Secretary is this: Virginia and Pennsylvania share something in common, and that is we call ourselves a commonwealth, not a state. There’s 46 states and there are four commonwealths, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Mass, and Virginia. Once when I was Lieutenant Governor I went to a school and I talked to a student just about your age, young lady, standing right in front of me, and I was in a classroom and a little girl asked me, ‘Hey, why are we a Commonwealth and everybody else is states?’And I did what a good politician was who doesn’t know the answer, I made something up on the spot. And I said, ‘Commonwealth — a state is a dotted line, it’s geography, Commonwealth says, it’s something about our values.’ The wealth we hold, we hold in common, it’s got to be about the community. It’s got to be about bringing everybody together, and Pennsylvania, you have the boldness to say that’s how you want to be known, and in Virginia, we have the boldness to say that’s how we want to be known.That’s our values. The wealth we hold, we hold in common, and those are Hillary Clinton’s values too. So, I’ll just ask you this last question and then bring up our next President. I think as far as it goes with the economy, we’ve got a really, really clear choice, and I’ll boil it down to this: Johnstown, Pennsylvania — do you want a ‘you’re fired’ President, or a ‘you’re hired’ President?I mean I don’t think it could be any simpler, we’ve got a ‘you’re hired’ President in Hillary Clinton, and I’m so proud to be her running mate and I’m so proud to bring her up to talk to you! Hillary Clinton, give her a big round!HILLARY CLINTON:Well I’ll tell you what, I’m glad I told Tim Kaine, ‘You’re hired,’ because you just got a great look at why the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia keep promoting him. He started off in the city council of Richmond, went on to become mayor of his hometown, got elected Lieutenant Governor then Governor, and now United States Senator, because he’s someone who really instills confidence in those whom he serves.And as America gets to know him, that’s exactly what I think will happen as well. We’ve got an incredible week here in Pennsylvania, I can’t tell you how much I love being here.And some of you may know that my father was from Scranton. My grandfather came as a small child from England, immigrant, to Scranton with his family. He worked in the Scranton lace mills, a factory his entire life, because he believed that he could produce a better life for his children, and he did. And every time I come to Pennsylvania, I think about the many journeys we made from where we lived, outside of Chicago, to Scranton, every single year.We would go every summer, we went some Christmases, I was brought back, as were my brothers to be christened in the little Court Street Methodist Church, we really have a great deal of love and affection for Pennsylvania. My father plus one of my brothers played football at Penn State, so –It’s always a joy for me to be here. And to come to Johnstown, a place that I’ve been to before and look forward to coming back and being here.And having this opportunity to come and visit with you. I want to thank Ron and Jim for welcoming us, […] thank you for explaining some of the work you do and telling us that Nick was a Marine at Camp David when Bill was President, we’ve actually met him in his prior life, so that was a very special treat. I want to thank my friend Leo Gerard, a man who has fought for justice, for working families in America, North America, and who sets a great example, as does this company, where business and labor work together.And Ron and Jim told me about something called gain share, where when you get more productive, get more productive, don’t have as much scrap, those gains are shared. That’s what I believe we ought to be doing in every single business in our country. So on Thursday, I was incredibly humbled and grateful to accept the Democratic Party nomination.I have to tell you, it was pretty overwhelming to be out there and to think about the awesome responsibility of taking on the challenges facing our country, but I’m an optimist, and I’m confident, because I think if you look at American history, that’s how we get things done. It’s not the whiners and the complainers and the insulters who move our country forward. It’s the workers and the builders, it’s people who get up every day and try to figure out how it’s going to be better for them and their families.So then yesterday, Tim and I and Anne and Bill hit the road, going across Pennsylvania — sorry we were a little late, the rain was really heavy and we have kind of a long convoy, so I apologize for that, but we are visiting places that prove what Americans can do. We have the most productive, competitive workers in the world, we just need to give our people the chance to succeed. So from Philadelphia to Hatfield to Harrisburg and now here in Johnstown, that’s exactly what we’re doing. We’re talking to people, meeting people who have each others’ backs. And you truly are the reason why I have so much confidence that America’s best days are still ahead of us, so –It’s in stark contrast to the vision that Donald Trump is laying out, because I don’t think we’re weak. I don’t think we’re in decline. I think we can pull together because we are stronger together, and if anybody like him spent a day on the factory floor here, they’d see what teamwork looks like. They’d understand what it means to create and build.Every day you are showing that America is home to the best products, the hardest workers, the most innovative entrepreneurs in world. And so as we are honest about our challenges here at home and abroad, let’s start from understanding that this country and our people have what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead if we have the leadership that gives us that chance. And most of all, we know better than to believe anybody that says, ‘I alone can fix it.’ Right? Those were actually Donald Trump’s words at the Republican Convention in Cleveland last week. And I think they should set off alarm bells for everybody. Because by saying that, he’s forgetting what all the rest of us do every day. He’s forgetting our troops on the front lines; our businesses who see possibilities in every problem; our unions who fight for working families every day.He’s forgetting companies like this one who invest in employees. Americans don’t say, ‘I alone can fix it.’ We say, ‘Oh, okay. How are we going to fix this together? How are we going to raise a family, build a business, heal a community, lift a country?’ And that’s why we have to stand together. My grandfather, as I said, worked at the Scranton lace mills from the time he was a teenager, until he retired at the age of 65. It was dangerous work in those days, but he was one of the kindest and gentlest men I’ve ever known. He knew that hard work in America meant that his family would get ahead — that it would pay off.And he was right. My dad, as I said, made it to college, made it to Penn State. Now, if he were still alive, he’d tell you it’s because he played football. But that’s okay. He got an education. He was proud to get it. He started working as a salesman, enlisting in the Navy after Pearl Harbor. And when the war was over, he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies. And it was a really small business. He would recruit my mother, my brothers and me. He had a print plant. It didn’t have any natural light. It was a pretty dark place.But it had long tables where the fabric would be rolled out, and then the silk screens would be laid on the fabric. And then the paint for the color you wanted to put on the fabric would be poured onto the silkscreen, and then we would take squeegee. One person on one side of the table, another person at the other side — sometimes me. We’d take that squeegee. We’d roll it — you had to add exactly the right pressure to the other side of the silk screen — , lift it up, move the screen, go down the table and keep going.I remember watching my dad standing for hours over those silk screens. Why did he do it? Because he wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had. And he did. I believe every single family in America deserves that same chance in 2016.And you know, I know we’re living in a time of really hot politics. People say all kinds of things — hateful things; insulting things. I’m sorry about that. I think we should have a much better dialogue and debate so that voters can decide which way they want to go. And sometimes, because of all of the static going back and forth, we lose track of where we are. We’ve come along way since the worst financial crisis in a generation. And it could have gotten a whole lot worse, my friends.When I think back to 2008, I was in the Senate then, before I accepted President Elect’s offer, President Elect Obama’s offer, to become Secretary of State. We were losing 800,000 jobs. 9 million Americans lost their jobs. 5 million homes were lost. But it’s fair to say we did not know where the bottom was. Unemployment: over 10 percent. Stock market: down to 7,000. This was one of the riskiest economic moments in our country’s recent history.And I will say it: I don’t think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for doing what they had to do to save our economy.And one thing they saved, and I’ll say it over the opposition of the Republican Party, they saved American auto industry, which is a big customer of this plant.I found that debate back then just unbelievable. People saying, giving speeches: “Let the American auto industry just fall.” Millions of jobs were at stake — many millions more families of the people who worked in the American auto industry. And I’m proud that it was saved, and I’m even prouder that it had the best year it’s had in a long time last year on behalf of selling American-made automobiles. So that’s progress.And I just want people, as we go into this election, to be fair. Because yes, we do have work to do. We can’t be satisfied with the status quo — I’m not. Not by a long shot. We’re still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before that recession and have stayed with us through the recovery. But let’s be fair and let’s be clear about where we’ve come from and where we need to go. And let’s not buy the same failed economic policies that got us into the mess we were in in the first place.You know that old saying: “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.” When people come around and say they’re going to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans, we have seen this before and it does not turn out well. And it’s about time we say, “No, we’re going to make the wealthiest Americans, for a change, pay their fair share of taxes and support America.” That’s why I’ve gone around the country talking to working families across America.And I’ve heard all the concerns people have that, you know, the economy isn’t working it needs to. Too many people feel like they’re out on their own. Well I can tell you that Tim Kaine and I will get up every single day. We will fight for you and we will work for you. We will look out for you. How do you know that? Because I’ve actually told you what I want to do. I’m not standing here insulting my opponent and making crazy promises. I’m telling you what I want to do. I actually have plans. Some people make fun of me for having plans. Yes, it used to hurt my feelings. It doesn’t anymore.At each of conventions, you get four days to tell the country what you want to do. That’s what they’re supposed to be for. At the Republican convention, they spent more time on insults for me than on jobs for you. Donald Trump spoke for 75 minutes and offered zero solutions. Now, I don’t think that’s good enough. I have the […] idea if you’re going to ask somebody for their vote, we owe you a clear explanation of what you’re going to get for it.And I have said from the beginning of this campaign, my mission from first day to my last, will be to create more opportunity and more good wages that will give people a chance at their own dreams. We’re going to create jobs in Pennsylvania and across America, especially in places that have been left out and left behind. And that means from our inner cities, to our small towns, to Indian country, to coal country, from communities ravaged by addiction like too many in this county.I believe with all my heart that the economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top. Leo knows because when I was privileged to work with him. To stand up for steelworkers. To start the very first Manufacturing Caucus in the United States Senate. I had no idea then that I was going to run for president. What I cared about is that I had lots of great people in New York who saw their jobs leave.Who lost them to automation and technology. Who were the victims of efforts to bust unions and undercut fair wages and benefits. So what I wanted to do was to make it clear that in America, we’re going to keep making things. Anyone willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well enough to support a family. That’s the basic bargain of America.So, here’s how we’re going to do it. Within the first 100 days of our administration, we are going to break the gridlock in Washington and make the biggest investment in new, good paying jobs since World War II. We will start by making the boldest investment in America infrastructure since we built the Interstate Highway System back in the 1950s.Now, Donald Trump may think we never win anymore and our country is full of losers, but, boy, is he wrong. We still do big things and we can do more big things. We’re not going to build a giant wall, we’re going to build roads and bridges and tunnels and forts and airports and water systems and a new electric […].And we’re going to connect up all of America to high-speed internet connectivity. You know, yesterday night in Harrisburg we had a great rally at the Broad Street Market, if any of you know that. We were outdoors. It was a beautiful night. And I said, you know, I’m not just talking traditional infrastructure. I’m talking about broadband, virtual infrastructure. Electricity.And I made a point that some teachers told me. There’s been a recent survey. 70 percent of teachers said that they assign homework that requires the student to go on the internet. Well, you know, that makes sense if you’re going to live in an information age you want your kids to be prepared and smart and savvy about how to use the internet.But here’s the kicker — 5 million don’t have access at home to high-speed internet. And then I was talking to some of the people who were there after the rally and they said boy, were you right. We have places in Pennsylvania where it’s still dial up.I mean, how are we supposed to be competitive in the rest of the world if we have smart, hardworking people — their businesses, their kids — their essentially shut out of being able to access information quickly and use that information. So, we’re talking broadly here. And I’m going to do everything we can to create a national infrastructure bank so that we are going to have investments made every year, not just when Congress decides to appropriate money for that.The second thing we’re going to do is invest in American manufacturing. Anybody who thinks we can’t make it in America ought to come to Pennsylvania and do a tour as I have. Now, the products that you’re making here in the Commonwealth are being sold all over the world, including products made right here. Ron and Jim were telling me about a big order you had from Bangladesh. You know, we can export. Donald Trump, you hear him, he talks a big game about putting America first.Well, with all due respect, please explain to me what part of America first leads Trump to make Trump dress shirts in Bangladesh, not Ashland, Pennsylvania. Or to make Trump furniture in Turkey, not Freeburg, Pennsylvania. Or Trump picture frames in India, not Bristol, Pennsylvania. In fact, my husband told me on the bus ride here that I was telling him that I just find it maddening that Trump goes around saying this and all the stuff he makes, he makes in other countries. And Bill says, well you know the shirt that he has one right now, he said that’s made in Reading, Pennsylvania.And, look, you’re not going to believe this because it’s going to sound too coincidental — it’s made at a company called Bills.Well, so Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again. Well, he could start by actually making things in America again. Now, if we’re serious about investing in America manufacturing, we have to be serious about defending American workers, and that means we’ve got to defend the right to organize and bargain collectively, which helped to build the American middle class in the first place.That’s why I love coming to plants like this that work business and labor together. But, that’s not Donald Trump. He actually hires union busting firms to break up organizing campaigns. He did that at the hotel in Las Vegas. And then he says he wants to do to America what he’s done to his businesses. We can’t let that happen. We’re going to fight back against attacks on working families, against assaults on the right to organize and bargain collectively. Right to work is wrong for workers and it’s wrong for America.And we’re going to say no to unfair trade deals. We’re going to stand up to China. We’re going to support our steelworkers, our autoworkers, our homegrown manufacturers. I feel strongly about this, and I need your help. I need your ideas about how we’re going to do this because I’m sick and tired of us having an open market where everybody gets to sell to us, and they often do it at lower costs, undercutting our workers, our businesses, that’s not fair and it’s not right. Now we’ve won a few cases, haven’t we Leo, in the International Trade Commission?But we’re going to go after that much more aggressively. I will be the first President who has what I’m calling a trade prosecutor to prosecute cases that are undercutting and hurting American manufacturers. Third, we’re going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century because there are millions of new jobs and businesses in that. Pennsylvania is doing some good work.We owe to future generations to work together to combat climate change, not dismiss it as a Chinese hoax the way Donald Trump has. I love this — he dismisses it as a Chinese hoax when he’s standing on a stage running for president and then he goes and asks for help because he’s worried about some of his golf courses that are maybe going to be hurt by climate change.I mean that is just hard to believe but we’ve got to take it for what it is. There is no other Donald Trump; you’ve got to look at it from both sides here. So we’re going to set bold goals. We’re going to install a half a billion solar panels and generate enough clean energy to power every home in America within 10 years.And we are going to create more good-paying jobs, clean energy jobs like the ones that are being created here in Pennsylvania. Fourth, we’re going to support small businesses like the one that my Dad and Tim’s Dad ran, put their hearts and souls into them when we were growing up.And it’s important for you to know this. Just as Tim told you, we don’t make this up. We actually try to tell you what is factually accurate. We go to a lot of trouble so we can tell you what is actually happening, not just pull it from the air. Just a few hours away in Atlantic City, you’re going to find a lot of hard-working contractors, small businesses, workers, painters, plumbers who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills.We’ve been meeting some of these people — painters, landscapers, plumbers, glass-installers, marble-installers — people who did the work and deserve to be paid and didn’t get it, not because he couldn’t pay them but because he wouldn’t pay them. That’s just not the way it works in America, Donald.In America we make good on our promises and when somebody puts in the work you are supposed to pay them. You can’t go around bullying small businesses like the one Tim’s Dad ran or my father — if my father had done all that work to print those drapery fabrics and most of his customers were hotels and businesses, and he used to load them into a van and deliver them and then put them up — after all that work, Donald Trump had said, “We’re not going to pay you,” my father first of all would have been stunned.And then he would have been furious. But what could he have done? Trump would have said, “Well you don’t like it? Sue me. Otherwise take 30 cents on the dollar.” That is so wrong, it just gets my blood boiling. I think about my Dad, I’m sure Tim thinks about his — small businesspeople who did not deserve to be treated like that and 98 percent of businesses in Pennsylvania are small businesses.That’s one million small businesses, creating jobs, strengthening communities. When you hurt small businesses, you hurt our economy. It’s time we gave small businesses a boost. Let’s cut the red tape, let’s make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks these days and we’re going to change that too.In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. And I will tell you how we’re going to pay for everything that I’ve just proposed. That’s not complicated, either. Wall Street, corporations, and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.Now let me be absolutely clear here, we don’t resent success in America. But when more than 90 percent of the gains in income have gone to the top one percent, that’s where the money is. Remember that old movie? Follow the money! Well, that’s what we’re going to do. American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return.Many of them are. Johnstown Wire Technologies is, but too many aren’t. So under our plan, if companies try to move headquarters to another country to avoid paying their taxes, we will make them pay an exit tax. It’s wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other. So we’re going to take back all the money that counties and cities and our governments have given to companies. We’ll make them pay it back. And we’ll put that money to work right here, creating good jobs.The basic principle is simple. America thrives when the middle class thrives, and I will not rest until we get wages and incomes rising for all Americans, not just those at the top. Just yesterday, an economist who advised John McCain, the Republican candidate for President in 2008, just put out a new analysis. He analyzed what Trump has said. He analyzed what I’ve proposed. He said my plans would create millions more jobs than Trump’s. In fact, under my plans, the economy would create at least 10 million jobs in our first term.As for Donald Trump? Well, his policies were found that they would actually cost us nearly three and a half million jobs. So what’s the difference between Donald Trump’s plan and my plan in terms of jobs created? The combined workforce of Pennsylvania and Ohio. In fact, the more you listen to Donald Trump, the more you realize he is not offering real change. He’s offering empty processes, and what little we know about his economic policies, from running up our debt, to starting trade wars, to letting Wall Street run wild, could devastate working families.So here we are, my friends. Now I know we’ve got to fight for every single vote. And I’m ready to do that. That’s why we’re on this bus tour, that’s why Tim and I and Bill and Anne and our campaigns are going to cover the country. Because we want you to know the differences. We want you to understand what we’re proposing and why we think it will work, and to contrast that with what Trump is saying.Now when I say things like this, like his plans would cost 3.5 million jobs, although I’m just quoting an economist, he lashes out. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. Just yesterday, he went after retired general John Allen, who commanded our troops in Afghanistan. General Allen is a distinguished Marine, a hero and a patriot. Donald Trump called him a “failed general.” Why? Because he does not believe Donald Trump should be Commander in Chief.Well I’d say that proves it. Our Commander in Chief shouldn’t insult and deride our generals, retired or otherwise. That really should go without saying, but I’m going to respond on behalf of General Allen to those kinds of insults. So, look, I know people are angry and frustrated. I think we just heard one. I understand that. I’m not going into this with some kind of rose-colored glasses. I know we’ve got work to do, but I’ll tell you this, when you’re President, and I know it, because I had a front row seat. I watched my husband as he struggled, and after eight years, we had 23 million new jobs, my friends. Incomes went up for everybody.And then, unfortunately, the Republicans came back. They slashed taxes on the wealthy, I voted against that. I spoke against that. Then they took their eyes off of the financial markets and the mortgage markets and you know what happened. And then we elected another Democratic president, who inherited another mess from the Republicans. It’s our choice, America. We can grow together, we can have plans that will enable us to create more jobs, give more people a chance to live up to their own dreams.Or we can go with demagoguery. We can go with insults. We can go with no plans and insofar as they are even understandable, that would cost us jobs. That’s the choice. And boy, is it a historic choice for America. I’m going to do everything I can in this campaign to make the case about what we can do, being stronger together. And I’m not going to respond to what Trump says about me, I don’t really care.I’ve grown a pretty thick skin. But I’m going to respond when he insults Americans, when he insults workers, when he insults unions, when he insults people who work hard for a living every single day. So let’s go out, let’s make our case, let’s win the election! Thank you and God bless you!”","Clinton Official"
"26",2016-07-29,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on American manufacturing jobs in Hatfield, Pennsylvania","Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at the KNEX factory in Hatfield, PennsylvaniaTIM KAINE:“[…] great to be here. And I know we’ve got employees from Rodon, K’NEX. We’ve got students. And raise your hand. I think we have a lot of teachers here. Raise your hand if you’re a teacher. All right. Very, very important.To begin, let me just say with Governor Wolf standing right behind me Philadelphia and Pennsylvania just knocked it out of the park. What a powerful combination. […] I mean, I like to brag in Virginia about Southern hospitality, but apparently there can be hospitality just about everywhere. And you guys did such a good job. And we really appreciate it. My wife, Anne, and I are now on the trail, excited to be part of this team.And just a couple of thoughts before I introduce our next president, thoughts about manufacturing, thoughts about education, and thoughts about pride. Manufacturing. This brings back memories coming here and seeing some machinery that is really familiar to me and then some machinery that is not so familiar. I grew up in a household where my dad ran a business called Iron Crafters Inc. in the stockyards of Kansas City. And it was an ironworking and welding shop. The first room we walked into, a lot of presses, punches, lathes looked exactly like the ones that I grew up working on, with his five or six employees and my two brothers and me and my mom basically all making that business work. That’s what small businesses do.So you will hear people say when it comes to manufacturing in America manufacturing is dead, but that is not the case. And it’s often these family businesses, just like Rodon K’NEX, that are keeping it alive that then are revitalizing it and bringing a renaissance so that we can do it in the 21st Century. And so we honor that in you, and that’s why we wanted to come by on sort of our first road stop on a two-day bus tour in Pennsylvania and Ohio to talk about jobs. We’ve got to bring manufacturing back. And the way we do it is using the examples of successful companies, like Rodon K’NEX.Second, education. We’ve got educators here. And we know how important that is.I’ll tell you something that I really liked last night. There were many moments in Secretary Clinton’s speech that I really liked. One of the ones was when she was talking about the need for a great workforce. She, as you know, has laid out a pretty important plan for families to enable us to educate our children and to try to guarantee them that they would go through college debt-free. Now, that would be a really, really big thing we could do for our kids.But you may have noticed that she also kind of said and really underlined it in what she said that we shouldn’t just perpetuate sort of the myth that it’s only about college education. It’s got to be about apprenticeships. It’s got to be about technical skills and trades and careers. Often jobs in these areas are the most likely jobs not to ever be outsourced. And so we have to have an education system that inculcates in the students an appreciation for manufacturing and trades.And that’s another reason, Mike, to you and the whole team here, Rodon K’NEX gets it. The products that you produce capture and spark that imagination in students, but you also work with educators to advance that cause. Hillary Clinton is a big believer that we’ve got to define educational success in a very broad way so that we can train and inspire the next generation of neighbors, just like Rodon K’NEXdoes.Now, the third thing is pride. This company has a pride story. This company had 50 percent, maybe more than 50 percent, of its product being produced outside of the United States, manufactured outside of the United States, before 2009. And when a lot of companies; in fact, including companies that are owned by the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, are pushing more and more jobs overseas and when there are policies, even tax policies, in the country that give you a benefit if you push jobs overseas, Rodon K’NEX was fighting against that trend, fighting to make it in America by proud American workers with high-quality products that nobody in the rest of the world can match. This is a pride story. And that is one of the reasons we’re here, too. You should be proud of yourselves just like Hillary.Hillary Clinton understands that pride. She feels that pride. She knows that the years, especially since 2008, with the greatest meltdown of the economy since the 1930s, have imposed an awful lot of pain on an awful lot of people and an awful lot of industries and an awful lot of communities. The American economy has climbed back up the ladder to climb out of it, but we have a long way to go. And she has laid out very clearly a set of strategies from the education strategies I talked about earlier to important strategies to make sure that those who are working are treated fairly in their benefits and their wages and also to investments to grow the economy, whether those be investments in innovation and research or investments in infrastructure to build the society that we want.Hillary Clinton is proud to be here, and so am I. Hillary Clinton is proud of the American worker and just wants to make sure that we have policies that reward work as much as we say we’re proud of the workers. And that’s one of the reasons why I am just so honored to be part of this ticket.So will you please do this with me: give a great Pennsylvania welcome to a history-making person who is going to lead us […] the 45th president of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton.”HILLARY CLINTON:“Thank you so much. Wow. I am — I am very honored and excited about being here with all of you. I am grateful to be here with your United States Senator, Bob Casey, someone whom I’ve known a long time and had the privilege of working with in the Senate, as Tim Kaine has had. I also am delighted to be here with Governor Tom Wolf, somebody who knows about family-owned businesses and how important it is that we keep them alive and thriving.And I also want to thank Michael, Michael Araten, for describing about what this company does, why it’s important, and the goals and the values that undergird it. So, in addition to Michael, I also want to recognize Joel Glickman and Bob Glickman, Garrett Talley, all of the families and employees associated with this company.Now, we could have come a lot of different places because we started off in Philadelphia after the end of the convention last night, but we wanted to drive through Pennsylvania, a state I’ve spent a lot of time in because my father was born in Scranton and we used to grow to Scranton every single summer and a lot of Christmases from our home outside of Chicago. So I’ve been all over Pennsylvania. And my dad played football at Penn State. My brother played football at Penn State. And it’s a place that’s very meaningful to me.And I was particularly pleased that Tim could be joined by his wonderful wife, Anne, who is the commissioner of education in the Commonwealth of Virginia. And I was so pleased that I could be joined by my husband, who knows a little bit about getting the economy to work well for everybody. And if you’re looking for a kind of pessimistic, downbeat vision of America, we’re not your folks. We do not buy into that dark, divisive image that was presented at the Republican convention last week. Donald Trump says America is weak, that we’re in decline. Well, all I can tell you is, we are the best-placed country in the world to seize the future. But that doesn’t happen by wishing for it. It happens by building for it, something that you here at K’NEX know a lot about.That’s why we’re on a jobs tour. We want to tell you what we will do if we’re so fortunate enough to be the president and vice president. We know that companies like this one provide some very important lessons. You have to have a well-trained workforce. The STEM and STED skills are important for the combination of design and production. We know that if we’re smart about it, we can bring jobs back from China and other places if we make up our minds to do that, just like that’s happened here. We know that companies that invest in their employees — as we were walking through the back, I introduced myself to a few of the employees. One had been here 24 years. One had been here 23 years — because Rodon and K’NEX actually see employees as assets to be invested in and treated with respect.So that’s why I’ve laid out throughout this campaign very specific plans about how we’re going to get the economy growing again, creating more good jobs, and helping people acquire the skills to fill the more than one million jobs that are available in America today, that are open, that are not being filled. There’s nothing we can’t do if we make up our minds that we’re going to address these challenges.So let me just briefly say we’re going to make big investments in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean energy technology. We’re going to do more to help small businesses start, grow, and succeed. We’re going to make it possible for more people to acquire the skills that you need to be competitive in the economy of today and tomorrow. We’re also going to make it a government policy to invest money in manufacturing communities, like Hatfield, so that more companies can make it in America. It’s absolutely wrong that American companies take tax breaks and then export jobs. They get the tax breaks in order to have jobs in America, and I believe if they take tax breaks and then they try to export jobs, they should have to pay back every single penny of every tax […] made for our country.And we will then put that to work in communities like Hatfield with companies like this. We’re also going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Now, this is something that I think is such an opportunity for America. As I said last night, I believe in climate change. It’s real. It’s happening. I’m not denying it. Why would I deny it? It’s real. […] And we can either wring our hands, or we can deny it, or we can accept it and we can treat it as both a challenge and opportunity.So that’s why I want us to produce and deploy half a billion more solar panels in the next four years, and enough clean energy to power every home in America. And I know that there’s clean energy jobs here in Montgomery County. Right, Marcel? Because I have visited some of those clean energy jobs. Some states are moving ahead and creating more clean energy through wind and solar and geothermal and other approaches. Some states are denying it.There’s a Republican governor in Florida who sent out an edict to his state employees as governor, if you can believe it, telling them that they would be disciplined and maybe lose their jobs if they wrote about or talked about climate change. (Booing.) And then down in South Florida, you have noonday floods happening. You have salt water getting into wells. Of all the states in America that are the most at danger from climate change, Florida is number one. And you’ve got a governor who is denying it at the cost of increasing insurance premiums and other kinds of risks. This is crazy.And when somebody like Donald Trump says, well, he thinks it’s a hoax, and that he’s not a scientist, well, go talk to a scientist. There are a lot of them right here in Montgomery County. We’re going to make sure that people start making and building things in America because we know that small businesses are at the core of creating most of the good jobs in America. As you heard Tim Kaine say, Donald Trump goes around with that hat on, Make America Great Again. Everything he makes he makes somewhere else besides America. The only thing he makes in America are bankruptcies, both his own and of the people who […]And it really is shocking. I didn’t know any of this before he became the leading Republican candidate. But then I started running into people who told me stories. Then I went to Atlantic City, and I met small businesses that had been ruined because they took work offered by one of Trump’s hotels and casinos. I met the man who installed the glass in one of his casinos, a small company. Submitted the bill. The work was done. The Trump organization said, no, we’re not going to pay. What do you mean, you’re not going to pay? I did the work. I employed people. I put my money up front to buy the supplies. We’re not going to pay you. It’s shocking.Then after a while they’ll come back and they basically say to the small businesses, go ahead and sue us. He keeps a battery of lawyers on hand in order to make it impossible for people to sue and be successful even when they’re in the right. I met the man whose small business — third generation, as I recall — supplied all the marble for one of the casinos. Same thing happened. We’re not going to pay you. It’s shocking. Then they come back and say, well, maybe we’ll pay you 50 cents on the dollar. Maybe 30 cents on the dollar. The marble company and its owners had to take bankruptcy, and they didn’t walk away with somebody else’s money the way that Trump did. They were destroyed as a company.We have a film about an architect who designed the clubhouse at one of Trump’s golf courses. It was a big job for this small architectural firm. He was really proud of it. Finished it. Ribbon cutting. It was opened. Events being held. The architect submits his bill. Doesn’t hear anything. A couple months go by. He calls. They say, we’re not going to pay it. The architect was so shocked, he said, well, I have to talk to Mr. Trump. I can’t believe he knows what you’re doing. Fine. The architect was in New York City. Goes into one of those big buildings with Trump’s name on it. Gets ushered into an office. Trump’s there with his lawyers. We’re not going to pay for it. But it’s built. I did the work. If you want to take 30 cents on the dollar, that’s all you’re going to get.I tell you those stories because if someone runs for president and says their primary qualification for being president is because they claim to be a successful businessman, then it’s only fair to ask, how did you become successful? We don’t resent success in America. But we do resent people who take advantage of others in order to line their own pockets on the way up.If I weren’t the Democratic nominee, I would still be going around the country saying, hey, take a hard look. When someone says, I can fix it alone, what does that really mean? Because I don’t know anybody who can. Instead, we are stronger together. We’re going to work together. We’re going to set goals together. We’re going to achieve those goals. And the centerpiece of my presidency will be more good-paying jobs with rising incomes for more Americans, because if you’re willing to work hard, you ought to be able to get ahead and stay ahead, in my experience.I’m just so happy to be here in a company with such a great history, such great values, such a great success, bring jobs back from China, and then exporting around the world. That’s what we have to do. Nobody can outcompete America when we put our mind to it. We’re going to roll up our sleeves and we’re going to get to work, and America’s best years are still ahead of us. Thank you all.”","Clinton Official"
"29",2016-07-26,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on rejecting Donald Trump’s vision of America in Tampa, Florida","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks in Tampa, FloridaThank you, Tampa! Thank you all. Thank you so much. Whoa. Are we ready to go win an election in November? Well, I think after the last week, what we saw in Cleveland, we’d better be ready to go win an election in November.I want to thank Delia for those wonderful words about her life growing up here in Tampa and her strong endorsement. I want to thank my longtime friend and my colleague from the Senate, your Senator Bill Nelson. I also want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Bob Buckhorn. I also have a few others to thank, because I’m thrilled to have so many strong Florida leaders here with us today — County Commissioner Les Miller; former Governor and soon-to-be congressman Charlie Crist; former Mayor Sandy Freedman; and we’ve got a great group of state representatives, councilmembers, and so many more, and I am grateful to each and every one of you who are here with us.I’ve got to tell you, did any of you watch that convention in Cleveland? Well, it was kind of perversely flattering. It’s hard to believe they spent so much time talking about me and no time talking about jobs or education or health care. No matter what your political leanings, I think we can all agree that never in the history of conventions, certainly, but I think even more broadly, have we moved forward together by pointing fingers and scapegoating and blaming people instead of rolling up our sleeves, getting a plan together, and then working to achieve it.Now, I mean, something has gone terribly wrong when one speaker says ‘vote your conscience’ and gets booed. I mean, I never thought I would say these words, but Ted Cruz was right. In this election, do the right thing and vote your conscience — vote for your future; vote for a United States of America.Now, look, I think many of us felt that those speakers, including of course their nominee, were not talking about the country we know and love. They weren’t talking about the work people do every day, the opportunities we try to seize, neighbors helping neighbors. I didn’t hear any of that. Instead, I heard about Donald Trump’s dark and divisive vision. Last night’s speech took it to a whole new level. He offered a lot of fear and anger and resentment, but no solutions about anything that he even talked about.He didn’t have a jobs program, did he? All that talk about keeping people safe; I didn’t hear any plans about what he’s going to do to support our police, to make sure that we are all working together. You could listen to that speech and you could think, my goodness, he believes America is in decline. And I’ve got to say, as he said this last night, I was pretty shocked. He said, ‘I alone can fix it.’ Now, just think about that for a minute, because it’s really important. His vision of America is one where we Americans are kind of helpless, we need to be rescued. I can’t really imagine him on a white horse, but — that seems to be what he’s telling us: ‘I alone can fix it.’ Well, he doesn’t understand that Americans, we Americans, we are strong, big-hearted, results-oriented, generous people in America.I’ve spent a lot of time, a lot of wonderful times, traveling across our country, and I’ve seen people fixing all kinds of things. I’ve met educators like Delia, working with teachers and parents to turn around schools and give kids a better chance. I’ve met small businesses and entrepreneurs who get up every day and work really hard. And you know when they make a contract for their goods or their services, they expect to be paid. I’ve met so many wonderful men and women who serve in our military; they know their job, they know the grave responsibility that they fulfill, and they get up every day and they do their best. But I’ve never heard one of them say, ‘Oh, I can fix it alone.’I was in Orlando before I came here to Tampa. And I had the great honor of sitting and talking with some of the residents of that beautiful city, and hearing what they are doing together to deal with the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in American history. The mayor spoke with great pride about how his city had responded. The police captain in charge of the SWAT team talked with such conviction about how when the moment arrived, the police in Orlando were ready. They had trained. They supported each other. They were ready. The captain didn’t say, ‘I can fix it alone.’ He said, ‘I’m a member of a team — the best team that anybody could have.’I met some of the hospital and the medical personnel who were there to take the wounded and worked so heroically to save lives, every one of them doing his or her part — triage, nursing — doing everything. I didn’t meet any one of them who said, ‘Hey, I can fix it alone.’I’ve never heard of an American leader, or at least someone who wants to be an American leader, claiming that he’s all we need. That’s not a democracy, my friends. As I recall, we had a revolution to make sure we didn’t have someone who said, ‘I can fix it alone.’The other thing he said that really shocked me — it is hard to know where to start, isn’t it? Well, last night Donald told us, ‘I am your voice.’ Well, I don’t think he speaks for most Americans, do you? He doesn’t speak for small businesses like the ones he has consistently stiffed and driven into bankruptcy and financial peril. He doesn’t speak for the workmen that he’s employed on his various projects and then refused to pay them. He doesn’t speak for the housekeepers and the cooks and everybody working at a hotel in Las Vegas that he owns that have voted to have a union and he refuses to even talk to them. He doesn’t speak for immigrants; he only speaks against immigrants. He doesn’t speak for people with disabilities. He doesn’t speak for our military, which he has insulted consistently, and in particular, prisoners of war who sacrifice much of their life because they serve us. And contrary to what they tried to say at their convention, I don’t think he speaks for women. I don’t think he speaks for working families who would be devastated by his reckless economic policies. He doesn’t speak for anyone who thinks our country should be standing together not splintering apart. He sure doesn’t speak for me, because I know we are stronger together and that’s what we’re going to be next year.Now, starting on Monday in Philadelphia, we will offer a very different vision. It’s about building bridges, not walls, between people. It’s about making the economy work for everyone not just those at the top. It’s about embracing our diversity that does make our country great.I have to tell you, in Orlando today, in listening to people who had been there that night, meeting a mother whose son died, meeting others who barely escaped after hiding from the killer, sitting around a table with leaders of the LGBT community, leader of the SWAT team, a county commissioner, and a Muslim imam who has been embracing the LGBT community, I was so proud, I was so proud. But — well, I’m proud of everybody in this country who gets up every day and makes a contribution and does your part. And what the folks in Orlando said to me was so touching. They said, ‘We have to stand against hatred no matter who it’s against’ — racial hatred, religious hatred, homophobia, xenophobia — all of these hates that infect the soul. And we have to stand against violence everywhere, and that includes standing up for common sense gun safety measures.I want to say something else, I really do, because this is serious to me. I love this country. I am so grateful for all the opportunities and blessings I’ve had, and I am so humbled by the prospect of being nominated next week in Philadelphia. But here’s what I want you to hear: I will do everything I can to make life better for hardworking Americans. I will do everything I can to bring people together. I will do everything I can to keep us safe, and I know a little bit about that.Now, you can’t put this — you can’t really put this into law is what I’m about to say, but we need more love and kindness in this country. We need more respect between and among our fellow Americans. We need to be listening more to each other. The last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are. We should be working to reach out to those who are different from us. Our differences, which make up our diversity, makes the United States the strongest, best positioned country in the world for the 21st century.I am proud to be an American, and I want to be sure that our children and our grandchildren have the same pride and the same opportunity to have the access to the American dream that so many of us have had so that they too can enjoy the fruits of freedom and liberty, justice and equality and opportunity.Now, look, I understand that there is a constituency for the fear and the anger that we saw last week. I know there are people who are feeling insecure and anxious about their lives, about their futures. They worry that maybe they’re not going to have as a high a standard of living as their parents or grandparents or as they themselves hoped. I know that there’s a lot of angst about all the changes that are happening in the world — technology, globalization. I understand all that. And I respect those who have legitimate concerns and questions.But I’ve never known America to quit on ourselves. I’ve never known us to give up in the face of tough challenges. I’ve never known us to basically retreat into the kind of isolationism that was being advertised at their convention. That is not who we are. Those are not the values that made this a great country. And don’t ever forget: We are a great country already!Now, can we do better? Of course we can. Can we be fairer? Can we provide more ladders of opportunity? Yes, we can. And that’s exactly what I intend to do if I’m given the great privilege of being your president. I will work every single day to make your dreams come true, to make you believe that America’s future can be even better than our past. We are a forward-looking nation, aren’t we? And I know that if we set our goals and we work to achieve them, we will. It has always been thus. This country has always delivered for the American people.Now, we’ve had some challenging times. We’ve taken some detours. It took a long time for some people to be given the same rights as everybody else. We know that. But there is no place on Earth that historically has continued to move forward towards that more perfect union. The last thing we need is somebody running for president who talks trash about America.So I hope you know that this campaign is really going to take a lot of work. I hope you will join us. I hope you will take your phones out and text, ‘join,’ J-O-I-N, 47246, or go to my website, hillaryclinton.com, to get involved. And I want to tell you this, especially the young and young at heart. We are hiring organizers right here in Florida. If you would like to apply, go to that website. We want the very most energetic, enthusiastic people because our success in the I-4 corridor is essential to our winning.And I’m excited about this campaign because I believe that when it’s all said and done, all of the scary speeches with all the side effects are over, people have stopped yelling at us at the top of their lungs like they did all week, that we will choose to be stronger together. That’s what I’m counting on. That’s what I, in my heart, believe, is the right course for our country. It is the only course, the only course that leads us with confidence and optimism into the future. And I know that we are up to the task. I know we are. And particularly to all the young people who are here today, every election is always about the future. This election is truly about your future.So today in Orlando, when I asked everybody around the table what they wanted, what they needed, they basically said, ‘We need people to understand what we’ve gone through, to be there for us for the long term, to help us help all those who were affected in all the families, and we need to stand up against hate and divisiveness.’ And the best way I can sum up what I hope this election will lead to — the conclusion we will reach together in November and the work we will do for the next four years– is — it really is great to be among so many optimistic people — but here’s what I — here is what I want you to remember. My last thought for you today. Just remember, love trumps hate.","Clinton Official"

I believe that more people in our country need to hear from Lizeth and other DREAMers across America. These young people are so important to our future. I told her I was really proud of her and I’m sure that her family and her parents in particular are very proud as well.And thank all of you for helping to make LULAC the united and energized organization it is today. For 87 years, you have been on the frontlines. Now I haven’t been around all of those 87 years, but I am proud to stand alongside you for part of that journey. There are a lot of people I know in this audience: people who have served as President and officers at LULAC, women who have led the women’s movement here out of LULAC.Back in the ’90s, we worked together to achieve universal health care. We fought the good fight. And when were defeated, we got right back up, and you helped us pass the Children’s Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million children in America today. I remember this very well because I worked with your leadership.Back then, LULAC made signs that read, ‘Let’s move forward with Clinton.’ Now, I found that very flattering. But I asked back then if we could please change the signs to ‘Let’s move forward together.’ Because that was more accurate. Because everything we achieved, we achieved together.And that’s how we’re going to write the next chapter of the American story, to put opportunity within reach of every family. We are going to do that together. And I for one, want, I want all Americans, from all backgrounds, to help chart that future. And I hope and expect that Latinos will play a leading role.Now you know this, but it bears repeating, you represent one of the fastest growing minority groups in America. By 2050, communities of color will represent the majority of our population. So of course Latinos have to help us shape the future of America because you are the future of America.Now I know from my own work going back decades that when we invest in this community — when we make it easier for Latinos to get an education, compete for jobs, start and grow new businesses and pursue your dreams — all of America benefits.That’s why I’m making to you two commitments for what I’ll do in the first 100 days of my Administration.First, we will make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II — with support specifically for Latino-owned small businesses.And I will also introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship.These two top priorities are what I have heard as I have traveled across the country, meeting with groups large and small. People who say, ‘Hey we want to succeed, we want to start a small business, we want to create more opportunity.’ And we need once and for all to end the vicious debate about comprehensive immigration reform.So first, with respect to jobs. We need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And we have to do this together as well. You know that better than anyone. Latinos are 17 percent of our country’s population — but you hold only 2 percent of its wealth. There’s a disconnect here. We’ve got to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages, with more opportunities to go to college, like Lizeth, to launch new ventures, and build wealth that you can pass on to your kids. Now, there are lots of ways of doing that, aren’t there? Well, one of the best ways is to face the fact that America’s infrastructure is crumbling.We need to rebuild. And we need to build our clean energy infrastructure, so we can increase efficiency, cut costs for consumers, and compete and win in the 21st-century green economy. It just so happens that more than a quarter of all construction jobs in America are held by Latinos. My plan will create thousands more jobs in these sectors, putting people to work rebuilding America. That is about the kind of future that we want together.And I have a special place in my heart for small businesses. My dad was a small businessman, very small. But he worked so hard and gave us a very solid, middle class life.So I want to do more to support Latino-owned small businesses, which have created so many jobs and so much growth across America. I have a plan to cut red tape, increase access to capital, and invest $25 billion to support innovation in communities that need that the most. That’s what we will do together. While we’re doing all that, creating these jobs, which is good for everybody in America.While we’re at it, let’s finally give workers a raise. It’s time to raise the minimum wage. No one who works full-time in America should ever live in poverty. The presumptive Republican nominee doesn’t believe we need to raise the minimum wage. In fact he has said wages are too high in America. Yes, exactly.And you know what else we need to do? We need to close the gender pay gap. This inequality of pay affects all women, but it is hardest on women of color. And hardest most of all on Latinas. On average, Latinas earn just 55 cents for every dollar earned by a white man. That is just outrageous. I know you understand this, and I am going to campaign on this across America in front of every audience. Because one of the fastest ways to raise income is to ensure equal pay. And people who say to me, ‘Well that’s a woman’s issue’ are missing the whole point. If you have a mother, a wife, a sister, or a daughter who is not being paid fairly, it’s your issue, it’s a family issue and it’s an American economic issue.And at a time when education is more important than ever, let’s make sure no one is forced to give up their dream of going to college because they can’t afford to pay. Over the last 20 years the number of Latinas going to college has tripled. We should applaud, that is a big accomplishment. Yet here is the catch, Latinos are still less likely than their white peers to graduate, often because they can’t afford to. That’s heartbreaking, isn’t it?I think we’ve gone backwards in many ways. We don’t provide enough help to students who really need it. My plan will change that. We’re going to make community college free. And we’re going to make public universities debt free.Now here’s what that means. For families making less than $125,000 a year, we will eliminate tuition altogether at public colleges and universities. We will also help those of you who already have debt refinance it and pay it back with more help.Now, also, in my first 100 days, as part of my commitment, I will introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. I want to say I know how painful it was when the Supreme Court made the decision it made. So many families had hoped that it would be different. And there is a lot of worry and concern across our country. So let me say this. We do, in my opinion, have a consensus that something must be done. Whether we get it done will depend on this election.For a long time the question of whether to reform our immigration system was hotly contested. Now there’s greater agreement, except in some circles. I deeply regret the kind of campaign the presumptive Republican nominee started with and is still running today. So part of what we have to be strong in standing for is a credible path forward for reform that is truly comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the system, including immigrants living here today, those who wish to come in the days ahead, from highly-skilled workers to family members, to those seeking refuge from violence, wherever that might occur.To families, this is an issue that matters more than we can measure. So there’s nothing that I take more seriously.I will send a proposal to Congress that will include a path to citizenship. That will fix the family visa backlog and strengthen our economy. And will enable our country to be what it’s always been — a place where people from around the world can come to start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation.And while we’re doing that, we must do everything we can to keep families already here together.So when the Supreme Court put DAPA on hold, and that affected 5 million immigrants, and it was devastating for millions of families. But it’s important to note the Court did not actually rule on the substance of the case. I’ve said throughout this campaign that DAPA is squarely within the President’s authority. And I will keep saying that and fighting for it.There’s more we can do. We need a simple, straightforward system where people with sympathetic cases or can show a history of service to their communities can make their case, and be eligible for deferred action. Like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses.And we absolutely must end family detention, close private detention facilities, stop the raids and round-ups. These actions are not consistent with our values. Too many children in our country say goodbye to their parents every morning, not knowing if Mom or Dad will be there when they get home. I know how important family is, and I want to do everything I can as President to keep families together. That’s one of the many reasons to finally get immigration reform through. There’s nothing more important to these families that live in fear and anxiety.Now jobs and immigration reform are just two of the issues that are at stake in this election. What happens this November really matters my friends. Now, I think that’s true in every Presidential election. But this one is different, isn’t it?We’re not just choosing a President and Commander in Chief this fall. The choice we make will say a lot about who we are and whether we understand and celebrate the diversity in our country, which makes us all the stronger.After the last election, the Republicans commissioned a major report, telling them everything they did wrong and what they’d need to do in order to win next time. One of the conclusions of that report was that Republicans had to work harder to appeal to Latino voters.Next week in Cleveland, they will nominate someone who thinks ‘Latino outreach’ is tweeting a picture of a taco bowl.What a difference a few years makes.Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be President of the United States.Let’s just remember why that is so. In the first weeks of his campaign, he said that immigrants from Mexico are drug dealers, rapists, murderers, carriers of infectious disease.He referred to a Latina contestant in his Miss Universe pageant as ‘Miss Housekeeping.’He insists — and I quote — ‘this is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.’ Well I have to tell you he doesn’t know much about our history and what a great opportunity we give to people from everywhere to come to this country. He criticized Jeb Bush for speaking — quote –‘Mexican.’ You can’t make this up.He wants to revoke the citizenship of 4 million Americans born in this country to immigrant parents, eliminate the bedrock principle in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution — that if you’re born in America, you’re a citizen of America. Now, I don’t know if you read about his visit recently to Capitol Hill to try to assuage the concerns of some of the House and Senate members. But he was asked a serious question by one of those members — what did he think about Article I of the Constitution and the powers that it described. He said, ‘I like Article 1, Article II, Article XII.’Well, there is no Article XII. I kind of have this old-fashioned idea that if you raise your hand to be sworn in as President to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States, you should know what is in the Constitution of the United States.Now, I often mention the 11 million people he wants to round up and deport. But if you add in the more than 4 million Americans whose citizenship he wants to revoke, it’s closer to 16 million. Never mind that this crazy idea could cost us nearly a trillion dollars in economic output. He is talking about undoing a fundamental value of our nation.Then there are his attacks against Judge Curiel, the distinguished judge in the fraud lawsuit against the so-called Trump University. Judge Curiel was born in Indiana. Last time I checked, it was part of the United States. His parents were born in Mexico. So, as far as Donald’s concerned, that means Judge Curiel can’t be trusted to do his job. He says that the judge should be disqualified because of his, and I quote, ‘Mexican heritage.’ Those are his words. He called him a ‘Mexican judge’ over and over again. It was a cynical, calculated attempt to fan the flames of racial division. And also to undermine people’s faith in our judicial system. Why would someone running for President want to do that?Even the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, called Trump’s comments, ‘the textbook definition of a racist comment.’I will say what Donald Trump won’t say. Judge Curiel is as American as I am. And as American as Donald Trump is.So just listen closely because when Trump talks about making America great again, that is code for taking us back to a time when racial minorities, and women, were marginalized, ostracized, treated as less than the full citizens, the full participants, the full human beings that we are.Now he’s making unfortunately, an impression on our children, too or dad or teacher about how to talk to their kids about Trump. In one recent survey, two-thirds of teachers reported that their students — especially those from immigrant families — feel afraid about what this election will mean for their futures.When our kids are scared by our policy debates, that’s a sign something has gone badly off the rails.It matters when at a high school sporting event in Indiana and Wisconsin, Latino teenagers are subjected to chants of ‘Build the wall!’ And ‘Speak English.’Donald Trump is running the most divisive campaign of our lifetimes. His message is that you should be afraid — afraid of people whose ethnicity is different, whose religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country.That’s, my friends, no innuendo or dog-whistle anymore. It’s all out in the open now.So we have to come back twice as strong and twice as clear.We have to say with one voice that Latinos are a vital part of the American community.And we saw that so tragically again last week.When shots rang out in Dallas last week, brave police officers ran into the gunfire. One of them was a man named Patrick Zamarripa. He was a Navy veteran. He served three tours in Iraq. He had a 2-year old daughter. And he was very proud of his Mexican heritage. On July 4th, in what would turn out to be his final tweet, this is what he wrote: ‘Happy Birthday to the greatest country on the face of this planet. My beloved America!’That is the Latino community. Loving. Dedicated. Proud. Patriotic.Whether you’re Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Afro-Latino, from Central or South America, whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existed, we are brothers and sisters, and I will be your champion. We are not strangers. You are not intruders. You’re our neighbors, our colleagues, our friends, our families. You make our nation stronger, smarter, and more creative. I want you to know I see you, I hear you, and I am with you.And together, together we must send a resounding message to Donald Trump in November and earn a decisive mandate against demagoguery and fear. It’s not enough to just complain, it’s not enough to talk to friends and neighbors or make speeches. We need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket.That will lead to more supportive state and local officials, who can put a stop to aggressive, anti-immigration measures. That will lead to more Senators and Representatives helping us craft immigration reform, and a Congress that will actually pass it.So I’m going to work my heart out, but I need your help. I need you at my side. Because this is your election. That’s why the work that LULAC is doing to help register voters is so critical. That’s why I’m fighting for automatic voter registration.When you leave this conference please go home and figure out what you can do to be a part of the LULAC registration movement. Let’s move forward together once more, toward a future built on the ‘kindness and compassion’ that Cesar Chavez envisioned, toward the ‘social change’ that Dolores Huerta marched for, toward a future that reflects that simple, timeless notion that all of us are equal.Judge Curiel is an American. Patrick Zamarripa was an American. Lizeth is an American.We are all proud Americans.And the promise of America is big enough for all of us.Let’s go forth and make that clear in the election of 2016. Thank you. God bless you!","Clinton Official"
"31",2016-07-25,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the VFW Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at the VFW Convention in Charlotte, North CarolinaThank you so much Commander. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you very much Commander for that very warm welcome.Thank you to your Executive Director, Bob Wallace your Commander-in-Chief, and all the men and women of the V.F.W., of the auxiliary, for your commitment, your service, and your action on behalf of America’s veterans.This is the 117th National Convention. That is a quite a legacy. And in that time, the V.F.W. has built a record to be proud of.You have been a moving force behind hallmark achievements: like the creation of the V.A.; the passage of the G.I. Bill; the establishment of national monuments dedicated to those who fought in World War II, the Korean War, the war in Vietnam, women in military service, and veterans disabled for life.These monuments are sacred places. I’ve been to many of them, also to our cemeteries around the world. People come to sit quietly, maybe lay a flower or a letter or other memento. To reflect on the courage and sacrifice of those who fought for our nation and our ideals. I don’t think it is an overstatement for me to say, those memorials might not exist if it weren’t for you.So thank you, and thank you for standing up today and every day for veterans’ health, for veterans’ education, for the right of all veterans to dignity and security. And thank you for continuing to push our nation to live up to our obligations to those who serve.I’ve been a direct beneficiary of your expertise and commitment — some of my top advisors are members of the V.F.W. I’m grateful to all the veterans and retired military leaders who have shared their knowledge and counsel with me — I especially want to thank the V.F.W. for the close consultation you provided as we work to put forth our plan to reform the VA. Today I especially want to acknowledge and appreciate Retired Marine General John Allen, former Deputy Commander of U.S. Central Command and Commander of the International Security Assistance Force overseeing NATO troops in Afghanistan. I had the great privilege of working with General Allen; therefore, I am deeply honored that he endorsed me this morning.His confidence in me — and that of the other esteemed military leaders who support my campaign — means a great deal to me. But it also imposes a high responsibility on me as well.So I thank you. I thank you for what you’ve done behind the scenes, as well as in public, to make sure that America keeps our promises, honors our history, and gives our veterans the respect and the opportunities they’ve earned.A lot of the issues you have fought for are at stake in this election. America is grappling with big questions:How do we keep our country safe? How do we make the world safer? How do we make sure we give our troops what they need to see their missions through — and when they come home, that they have the support and access to services they need to lead healthy, productive, successful lives?These challenges matter to me personally, not only as the proud daughter of a veteran. My father, Hugh Rodham, enlisted in the Navy shortly after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He became a chief petty officer responsible for training thousands of young sailors before they shipped out to sea, mostly to the Pacific Theater. After my father died in 1993, I received letters and old photos from men who had served under him, talking about what a difference my dad made in their lives — these are letters that I treasure.My dad once told me how sad he felt when he left Great Lakes Naval Base and accompanied his trainees to the West Coast to join their ships. He knew some of these bright, energetic young men wouldn’t survive. Some of them probably thought it too. But still, they went to serve. Because they knew our country needed them.That’s the kind of courage and honor our men and women in uniform demonstrate every single day.I thought a lot about my father’s experiences later, when I became a Senator from New York serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and then as Secretary of State. I’ve worked hard over the years on many of the issues you care about and work on every day. I am not a newcomer to these issues.And today, I want to tell you a few of my core beliefs, which will guide me if I have the great honor to be elected this fall.Because Americans aren’t just choosing a President — we’re also choosing a Commander-in-Chief. The person who decides questions of war and peace, life and death. There’s no more solemn or serious a responsibility than that.So you deserve to know what we candidates believe about national security, and how we’d go about making life-or-death calls. Because they will affect our men and women in uniform, first and foremost. And they will affect our veterans.Let’s start here — I believe the United States of America is an exceptional nation, with capabilities that no other country comes close to matching. And we have the world’s greatest military — don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. We also have an economy that is larger, more durable and more entrepreneurial than any other on the planet.And we are guided by values that have long inspired people across the world — a commitment to freedom and equality, justice and diversity — that fundamental American idea that every single person deserves to be treated decently and with respect, no matter who they are.I believe in standing with our allies because they are part of what makes us exceptional. No country in the world has relationships like we do.Generations of American troops fought, and yes, died to secure those bonds, because they knew we were safer with more friends and partners and fewer adversaries and enemies. Our men and women in uniform carry that work forward today.My running mate in this election is a wonderful man from Virginia named Tim Kaine. He’s a U.S. Senator, he was governor of Virginia, mayor of Richmond, Virginia. If you’re not familiar with him yet, I urge you to check him out. He’s a great public servant and a terrific guy. His son is a Marine.His son is actually deploying today to help defend our NATO allies in Europe. That’s how committed he is — and many others are — to our alliances, and we should be, too. After all, America’s word has to mean something.I believe in being firm but wise with our rivals — finding common ground where we can, and standing our ground when we must.That’s the balance that made it possible for me to work with all kinds of nations: to work to increase pressure on North Korea; to work to stand up to the Chinese in the South China Sea; to work with Russia to conclude the new START treaty that reduces nuclear stockpiles, while standing up to them because of their threats to our friends in Eastern Europe. One thing for certain you will not ever hear me is praise for dictators and strongmen who have no love for America.And yes, I believe with all my heart in democracy. And I believe in diplomacy. It’s often the only way to avoid conflicts that can end up exacting a much greater cost.I believe the most sacred responsibility of a Commander-in-Chief is deciding whether to send men and women into battle. I have visited our troops in theaters of war and tension. I know how serious this is. Force must only be used as a last resort, and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy. Our troops deserve nothing less; America expects nothing less.I believe our troops strive to comport themselves with honor. They deserve a Commander-in-Chief who will never order them to commit war crimes.I believe in listening to our generals and admirals, because they have invaluable knowledge and experience, and they’re doing one of the most important jobs there is: commanding America’s sons and daughters. As Commander-in-Chief, I will always show them respect and hear them out.You will never hear me say that I only listen to myself on national security. I believe in doing everything we can to meet threats at home and abroad. I know we live in a dangerous world. That’s why we need real plans, real strategies, to deal with terrorism, including homegrown terrorism. I’ve worked with experienced people from across different fields, and indeed across the political spectrum, to come up with comprehensive strategies for these and other threats.I will be ready to get to work on Day One — I take nothing more seriously than our security.Most of all, I believe in American leadership. I believe that who we are as a people, the values that we hold dear, the history that we care about, matters a great deal. I’m not interested in talking provocatively; I’m not interested in insulting people, including our military; I’m interested in bringing our country together — I’m interested in healing the divisions.We have to protect ourselves against terrorists.To do that, we need to lead other countries in stopping ISIS, al Qaeda, and other radical jihadist groups. We shouldn’t leave that to the rest of the world to figure out on their own — that won’t keep us safe.We need a strong global economy, because it’s good for American jobs and exports. That means we should lead in setting and enforcing the rules. If we retreat on either security or the economy, behind some kind of imaginary wall, we will have lost our leadership, our purpose, our chance to prevail in the 21st Century.Because if America doesn’t lead, we leave a vacuum — and that will either cause chaos, or enable other countries to rush in to fill that void. Then they will be the ones making the decisions about American lives, jobs and safety. The choices, make no mistake about it, might not be to our benefit. That’s not an outcome we can live with.I have set forth plans and strategies for dealing with these threats. I know how challenging it will be to meet the difficulties that we face in the world today. But you see, I have confidence. I have optimism. I don’t understand people who trash talk about America — who talk about us as being in decline, who act as though we are not yet the greatest country that has ever been created on the face of the earth for all of history.If you want somebody who will scapegoat other people, peddle fear, and smear, I’m not your candidate. I’m interested in bringing everybody together, rolling up our sleeves, and getting to work to solve our problems.That’s why, in the Senate, I worked closely with Republicans. Now as some of you might know, I have been the recipient of numerous political attacks for a very long time. I’ve learned to live with that. I have, as Eleanor Roosevelt advised many years ago, ‘If a woman wants to be in a public arena, you’ve better develop skin as thick as the hide of a rhinoceros.’ So when I got to the Senate, I didn’t say, ‘Oh, I’m only going to talk to Democrats. I’m not going to work with Republicans.’ How silly would that be?I was elected to represent the great Empire State. And I wanted to do everything I could to produce results for the people who honored me by electing me to be their Senator. So I worked with Republicans to increase the benefit paid to family members of the fallen; to expand veterans’ access to military health insurance; to make sure that all members of the Reserves and National Guard, and their families, had access to Tricare military health benefits even when they were not deployed.I introduced the Heroes at Home Act to establish new services for military members and veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries.I fought successfully in 2007 to amend the 2007 Defense Appropriation Act, to establish a training program for family caregivers helping their loved ones with TBI.I did all of this because I had met so many wonderful people who were struggling, struggling because they lost a son, or a daughter, a mother, a father, a wife, or a husband. Struggling because their loved one came home and didn’t have the care that he or she needed. They deserved more support from all of us, and I, fortunately, was in a position to advocate for them.I joined forces with Senator John McCain to personally raise money for the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, which helped build a state-of-the-art rehab facility in San Antonio to help our seriously wounded service members coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan.And let me just say it was a pleasure to work with Senator McCain on that project and many others. I believe that he, and all American prisoners of war, are heroes and deserve the respect that that entails.As President, I will build on the work I’ve done.We’re going to have a 21st Century Department of Veterans Affairs that delivers world-class care.Like you, I was outraged by the V.A. scandals — people waiting months, even years for things like wheelchairs and basic medication — some even dying while languishing on a waitlist for an appointment. Heartbreaking and absolutely unacceptable. That’s why I have put forth a detailed plan about what I would do as President to revamp the V.A. — it will be one of my highest priorities. But I will tell you this: we are not going to privatize the V.A., we are going to reform it and make it work for every single veteran in America.We will ensure access to timely, quality care; improve the coordination of care, which as you know is a huge problem still; improve care for women veterans, who are often under-served; tackle and at long last, end the epidemic of veteran suicides by expanding access to mental health care, erasing the stigma that still prevents too many from getting the help they need. I know this is a high priority for the V.F.W. and other veterans service organizations. And I will do everything in my power to support you in this critical work.And we’re going to help more veterans looking for jobs with expanded tax credits for businesses that hire veterans, more support to veterans who want to start their own businesses, better certification and credentialing programs, so the work that veterans did on active duty will be understood and respected as they compete for the jobs in the civilian sector that they deserve to be considered for and hired to perform.And I’m going to crack down on companies that prey on or discriminate against veterans. They should be ashamed of themselves, and we are going to hold them accountable.We will also follow the lead of cities like New Orleans, Houston, Philadelphia, and Las Vegas, which have worked to end veteran homelessness. We have lessons to learn from them. Many more cities are making strong progress toward that same goal — we should support them, and end the tragedy of veteran homelessness once and for all.And I will protect, preserve and defend the post-9/11 G.I. Bill. It has opened doors of opportunity to more than one million veterans and family members. Unfortunately, there are some Republicans in Congress chipping away at it. That’s not just wrong — it is short-sighted. This program helps us recruit and retain the all-volunteer force we need to protect our country. And it’s a way to invest in families and our shared future. We should protect and strengthen it, not let anyone erode it.So yes, I have a plan to do all this and more. Including supporting military spouses as they seek to build careers. Including standing with women, standing with LGBT veterans to make sure they get the support they’ve earned.You can go to my website, and I hope you will, hillaryclinton.com, and read all the details. I hope you will, not only because I want you to know, but there’s a lot of expertise in this room. I want your ideas too. I have this old-fashioned notion: you run for President, you should tell people what you want to do, as specifically as possible. So they can actually make up their minds. And then you should be held accountable as to whether or not you deliver results. So here’s my bottom line.This is something that I care deeply about. But I know a lot of veterans still feel invisible, powerless, like their country has forgotten them. That is just totally wrong. It’s unacceptable, and we have to work together to make sure we end that.We can disagree about the details. I’m sure we will from time to time. You see I actually believe as someone who’s been in public life and public service, it’s better if we have honest, candid conversations. That’s the best way in a democracy for us to come up with the best solutions. But we should be guided by our values.We can all agree that our troops deserve serious, strategic leadership. We can all agree we have to be serious and committed about the complexity of the challenges we face, here at home and around the world. Beneath whatever disagreements we might have as a country about how to get where we need to go, surely we can start listening to one another again. Respecting one another, our individual experiences that bring so much to the debate.My father made sure I understood that the freedoms and rights we enjoy as Americans didn’t come out of thin air. People sacrificed for them. Fought, bled and died for them. People like you, and the generations of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen who have made our country strong, proud and free.All of you, everyone who has served deserve our thanks, and more importantly, our respect. You deserve a country and a president and a commander-in-chief who honor your service. Not just with words but with deeds.That’s what the V.F.W. has stood for. To make sure that America lives up to that standard.And as President, I will be working alongside you as I did as Senator to make sure that we produce results. I know this is the first time that one of our two major parties has ever nominated a woman.And I know, that it takes a little getting used to, even for me. But here’s what I want you to know. I will get up every single day in the White House, doing everything I possibly can to protect our country, to treat our men and women in uniform with the care, and concern and respect they deserve. To make good on our nation’s promises to our veterans. That’s how I was raised, that’s what I have done, and I promise you that’s what I will do. Thank you, V.F.W. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you all very much","Clinton Official"
"32",2016-07-18,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the NAACP 107th Annual Convention in Cincinnati, OH","Hillary Clinton gave the following remarks at the NAACP 107th Annual Convention in Cincinnati, OH.Hello, NAACP!

A treasure not only for New York, but for the NAACP and for our country. Thank you so much dear Hazel.I want to thank your Chair, Rosyln Brock. Thank you so much Madame Chair. Your President and CEO Cornell Brooks, and everyone here today, including all the elected officials who have already appeared before you and those who will be addressing you during this convention.And I have to start by saying we all know about that other Convention happening up in Cleveland today. Well, my opponent in this race may have a different view, but there’s nowhere I’d rather be than right here with all of you.For more than a century, you’ve been on the frontlines, pushing America to become a better, fairer country. You and your noble predecessors have marched, sat in, stood up and spoke out – all to bring us closer to our founding ideals of equality for all.And yes we have made progress, we see the results: in classrooms where children of all races learn side by side; in boardrooms and break rooms, where workers of all backgrounds are able to earn a living and support their families; at every level of government, where more and more the people we elect to represent America actually look like America.And, of course, in the White House, with our wonderful President and First Lady and their daughters, Barack and Michelle Obama.So as the President has said, and indeed, as he exemplified, we’ve come a long way.  But you know – and I know – that we have so much further to go.We were cruelly reminded of that with the tragic deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two more black men killed by police incidents, this time in Louisiana and Minnesota. And then in Dallas, five police officers killed while serving and protecting peaceful protestors, targeted because they were police.And we saw it again just yesterday, when three police officers were shot in an apparent ambush in Baton Rouge. This madness has to stop.Watching the news from Baton Rouge yesterday, my heart broke not just for those officers and their grieving families, but for all of us.  Because we have difficult, painful, important work ahead of us to repair the bonds between police and communities, and between and among each other.  We need one another to do this work.  And we need leaders like the NAACP. We need police officers to help us do this work.  These murders threaten all of that.Killing police officers is a terrible crime.  That’s why our laws treat the murders of police so seriously because they represent the rule of law itself. If you take aim at that, you take aim at all of us. Anyone who does it and anyone who helps must be held accountable.  And as president, I will bring the full weight of the law to bear in making sure that those who kill a police officer are brought to justice.  There can be no justification.  No looking the other way.  We all have to make sure and pray it ends.The officers killed yesterday in Baton Rouge were named Montrell Jackson, Matthew Gerald, Brad Garafola.  When they died, they were responding to a call about a man with a gun.  How many families, how many more families, would pay the price if we didn’t have brave men and women answering those calls?  That’s why I’m haunted by the images of what the officers were doing in Dallas when they died.  Protecting a peaceful march, talking with the protestors. Where would our democracy be without courageous people willing to do that?So we all need to be partners in making law enforcement as secure and effective as it needs to be. That means investing in our police – in training on the proper use of force, especially lethal force. How to avoid using force to resolve incidents.Officer safety and wellness – everything they need to do their jobs right and rebuild trust with their communities.  I’ve said from the beginning of my campaign, that will be my priority as President.Perhaps the best way to honor our police is to follow the lead of police departments across the country striving to do better.  The deaths of Alton and Philando drove home how urgently we need to make reforms to policing and criminal justice — how we cannot rest until we root out implicit bias and stop the killings of African Americans.Because there is, as you know so well, another hard truth at the heart of this complex matter. Many African Americans fear the police. I can hear you, some of you in this room. And today there are people all across America sick over what happened in Baton Rouge and in Dallas. But also fearful that the murders of police officers mean that vital questions about police-community relations will go unanswered.Now that is a reasonable fear isn’t it? All of this tells us very powerfully that something needs to change. Many police officers across the country agree with that. There’s a real opportunity here for cooperation.But that can only happen if we can build trust and accountability. And let’s admit it. That gets harder every time someone else is killed.So now is the time for all good people who agree that the senseless killings must end to stand up, speak out loudly and clearly. I know that the NAACP, and so many of you individually, will do all you can to help our nation heal and start the work together to meet these challenges.We must reform our criminal justice system because everyone is safer when there is respect for the law and when everyone is respected by the law.And let’s admit it, there is clear evidence that African-Americans are disproportionately killed in police incidents than any other group.  And African-American men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men convicted of the same offenses.  These facts tell us something is profoundly wrong. We can’t ignore that. We can’t wish it away. We have to make it right.That means end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system – not half-measures, but a full commitment with real follow through. That’s why the very first speech I gave in this campaign, back in April of 2015 was about criminal justice reform. And the next President should make a commitment to fight for the reforms we so desperately need. Holding police departments like Ferguson accountable. Requiring accurate data on in-custody deaths, like Sandra Bland. Creating clear, national guidelines on the use of force, especially legal force. Supporting independent investigations of fateful encounters with the police. So I pledge to you, I will start taking action on day one and every day after that until we get this done.And you know what? When the 24-hour news cycle moves on, I won’t. This is too important. This goes to the heart of who we are. This is about our character as Americans. That’s why we also need to fix the crisis of mass incarceration. Eliminate the disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine. Dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline that starts in school and diverts too many African American kids out of school and into the criminal justice system, instead of giving them the education they deserve to have. And we need to do, all of us need to do – and I look forward to working with the NAACP – we need to do a much better job of helping people who’ve paid their debt to society find jobs and support when they get out.America is well known, and we want to be a land of second chances – but so many Americans never had a first chance to begin with.  So let’s give everyone a fair chance at rebuilding their lives.  As Abraham Lincoln said, “Give everyone a fair chance in the race of life.” My plan would make significant investments in reentry programs for the formerly incarcerated.  And I will “Ban the box” in the federal government. People deserve a real shot at an interview instead of being told “No,” right out of the gate.Then beyond criminal justice, we must, we must fight for commonsense reforms to stop gun violence. This is by far, gun violence, by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.  The wrong people, the wrong people keep getting their hands on guns.  And not just any guns – military weapons, like the kind the Dallas shooter had, which allowed him to outgun the police.That’s why the Cleveland police, yesterday, demanded that the state suspend open carry of guns on the streets during the Republican National Convention.  And last week, the extraordinary and inspiring Dallas police chief, Chief Brown, told lawmakers, “Do your job. We’re doing ours,” he said.  He’s right.  When he went on to say we’re putting our lives on the line. We’ve got to do better.People who should care about protecting of police officers should be committed to getting assault weapons off the streets to start with.  And they should join us in instituting comprehensive background checks because law enforcement officers are nearly 50 percent, nearly 50 percent, less likely to be killed in states where there are checks on the purchase of handguns.But even if we succeed in passing these laws and implementing them, we’ve got to go even further than that.We need to do something about the racial inequities in our healthcare system.  Right now, black kids are 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than white kids – 500 percent! Right now a black baby in South Carolina is twice as likely to die before her first birthday as a white baby.  Imagine if those numbers were reversed, and it were white kids dying.  Imagine the outcry and the resources that would flood in.And let’s do everything we can to create more jobs in places where unemployment remains stubbornly high after generations of underinvestment and neglect.  I’m a big fan of Congressman Jim Clyburn’s “10-20-30” plan – steering 10 percent of federal investment to neighborhoods where 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 years.That should go nationwide because the unemployment rate among young African Americans is twice as high as for young white people. And because of that, my plan also includes $20 billion aimed specifically at creating jobs for young people. If you don’t get that first job, it’s hard to get the second job, and it’s hard to build that solid financial base.And because of the Great Recession, the median wealth for black families is now just a tiny fraction of the median wealth for white families.  That’s why my plan includes steps to help more African-American families buy a home, which has always been one of the surest ways to build wealth and security for a family.We will do more to support black entrepreneurs get access to capital. And I want to give a shout out to black women, who represent the fastest-growing segment of women-owned businesses in America.I want to unleash all of that energy and all of that talent. We need to view all of these issues also as part of the struggle for civil rights. Rosa Parks opened up every seat on the bus: our challenge now is to expand jobs so that everyone can afford the fare.  And let’s ensure that the bus route reaches every neighborhood, and connects every family with safe, affordable housing, good jobs, and quality schools.Now, I know none of this will surprise those of you who know me. I’ve got a lot of plans. You can go to my website, Hillary-Clinton-dot-com and read our full agenda.Because you see, I have this old-fashioned idea: if you’re running for President, you should say exactly what you want to do and how you will get it done.  I do sweat the specifics because I think they matter.  Whether one more kid gets health care, one more person finds a job, or one more woman entrepreneur gets access to capital to follow her dream – those just may be details in Washington, but it really matters to those people and their families.And the truth is, we need to plan because we face a complex set of economic, social and political challenges: they’re intersectional; they’re reinforcing.  We’ve got to take them all on. We can’t wait and just do one at a time.But the answers won’t just come from Washington.  Ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of us – especially, especially those of us who haven’t experienced it ourselves.I’ve been saying this for a while now – and I’m going to keep saying it, because I think it’s important.  We white Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers you face every day.We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone’s experiences.We all need to try, as best we can, to walk in one another’s shoes – to imagine what it would be like to sit our son or daughter down and have “the talk” about how carefully they need to act around police because the slightest wrong move could get them hurt or even killed.Let’s also put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to do a dangerous job that their families pray will bring them home safe at night. Empathy works both ways.  We’ve got to try to see the world through their eyes, too.When you get right down to it, that’s what makes it possible for people from every background, every race, every religion, to come together as one nation.  It’s what makes our country endure.And in times like these we need a President who can help pull us together, not split us apart.  I will work every single day to do just that. And what I’m about to say, I say with no satisfaction, the Republican nominee for President will do the exact opposite.He might say otherwise if he were here.  But of course, he declined your invitation.So all we can go on is what he has said and done in the past.Donald Trump led the movement to de-legitimize our first black president, trumpeting the so-called “birther” movement.Donald Trump plays coy with white supremacists.  Donald insults Mexican immigrants, even an American judge born of Mexican heritage.  Donald Trump demeans women.  Donald Trump wants to ban an entire religion from entering our country.And Donald Trump loves to talk to the press.  But let’s not forget, let us not forget: the first time Donald Trump was quoted in The New York Times was in 1973, when the Justice Department went after his company for refusing to rent apartments to African Americans.It was one of the largest federal cases of its kind at the time. And when federal investigators spoke with Trump’s employees, they said they were instructed to mark rental applications from black people with a “C.” A “C” for colored.By now, we’ve heard a lot of troubling things about Donald Trump but that one’s shocking.This man is the nominee of the Party of Lincoln.  And we are watching it become the Party of Trump.  And that’s not just a huge loss to our democracy – it is a threat to our democracy.And it all adds up, it all adds up to an undeniable conclusion:  I don’t care if you’re a Democrat, a Republican, an Independent — Donald Trump cannot become President of the United States.And that’s why we’ve got to work together to get out the vote this fall.You know that better than anyone.  That’s why the theme of this conference is “Our Lives Matter, Our Votes Count.”I agree with both of that. And now I think your votes count more than ever.That’s why we’ve got to stand up against any attempt to roll back the clock on voting rights.  Encourage everyone, everyone we know to stand up and be counted in this November election.As Dr. King said, “Our lives begin to end when we become silent about things that matter.”  None of us, none of us, can afford to be silent with so much at stake.That’s why, here today, I am pleased to announce a nationwide drive to get 3 million people to register to vote and to commit to vote in this election.We are hosting more than 500 registration events this week, across the country. We’re going to minor league baseball games, college campuses, barbershops, hair salons, street corners. And with those we cannot connect with in person, we’ve created an online, one stop shop registration tool, in English and in Spanish.And my team in Ohio wanted me to make sure you all know that we’re hiring.  We actually have a recruiter here today – he’s got a table set up in the hall.  We’re hiring paid organizers to help us get out the vote and get our message out all across Ohio. So please spread the word – we want great people on our team.  That’s the way we’re going to be successful. We’re not the red team or the blue team, we’re the American team, and it’s time we start acting like it.I have no doubt we can rise to meet these challenges if we stand together– no doubt at all. And if we are looking for inspiration, let’s go to one of the officers killed yesterday. 10 days ago, Montrell Jackson, a young African American police officer in Baton Rouge, posted a message on Facebook, he wrote so honestly and powerfully about the struggle of being black and wearing blue in today’s America.“I’m tired,” he wrote, “in uniform I get nasty, hateful looks, and out of uniform, they consider me a threat.” He went on, “These are trying times, please don’t let hate infect your heart. I’m working in these streets, so any protesters, officers, friends, families, or whoever, if you see me,” Montrell said, “and need a hug, or want to say a prayer, I’ve got you.”That, my friends, is the strength of America. Men like Montrell Jackson. Despite all our challenges, that spirit of love and community must guide us still. We have to heal the divides that remain, make the United States what it should be, stronger and fairer. More opportunity for every one of our people. I would not be standing here on the brink of accepting the Democratic nomination if I did not believe, if I did not in my heart believe, that America’s best years are still ahead of us. So let us go forward with faith, with confidence, with optimism. Our children and our grandchildren deserve no less.Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America. ","Clinton Official"
"33",2016-07-13,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on American Values","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks in Springfield, Illinois.Hello! Hi. Thank you all very, very much, please be seated, it’s wonderful being back here. It’s always a special privilege having grown up in Chicago in the suburbs to be here in the state capitol and especially here in this great historic place filled with so much meaning, not just for Illinois but for our country. And I’m delighted to have this opportunity to talk with you about the state of our country today.Nearly 160 years ago, Abraham Lincoln gave a speech in this statehouse that marked a turning point in the political life of our nation.The question of slavery was being fiercely debated across America. Roughly half the states allowed it. Half abolished it. And some people – including Lincoln – believed that until it was gone entirely, our country would never be truly united and at peace.                                                                                        So on June 16, 1858, when Mr. Lincoln kicked off his campaign for the United States Senate, he delivered an address on how slavery was tearing our country apart. And that it must go. Some thought that he ended up losing that Senate race because of that speech. But then he won the Presidency. And some thought it was because of that speech.  President Lincoln led America during the most challenging period in our nation’s history. He defended our Union, our Constitution, and the ideal of a nation ‘conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.’ His legacy included laws and amendments that enshrined those values for future generations. They protect and guide us still.I’m here today, in this place, because the words Lincoln spoke all those years ago still hold resonance for us now.Remember, he said, ‘A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect,’ he went on, ‘The Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall. But I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.’The challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincoln’s time. Not even close. And we should be very clear about that.But recent events have left people across America asking hard questions about whether we are still a house divided.Despite our best efforts and highest hopes, America’s long struggle with race is far from finished.  In just the past week, we saw black men killed by police and five police officers killed by a sniper targeting white police. There is too much violence and hate in our country. Too little trust and common ground. It can feel impossible to have the conversations we need to have, to fix what’s broken.And despite being the richest country on earth, we have too much economic inequality – and that also undermines the foundation of our democracy.Lincoln understood that threat, too. He deeply believed everyone deserved – in his words – ‘a fair chance in the race of life.’ He saw it as a defining feature of the United States, and believed it was vital that hard-working people be free to enjoy the fruits of their own labor. It’s one of the reasons he was so strongly against slavery – because it violated that entire notion. And as President, he took pains to use the tools of government to create more economic opportunity for Americans at every level of society. So, too, must we fight inequality and create opportunity in our time – not just for some Americans, but for all.So I come today as a mother and a grandmother to two beautiful little children. Who, I want them and all our children to grow up in a country where violence like the kind we saw last week doesn’t happen again – and where the American Dream is big enough for everyone.I’m also here as a candidate for President who is deeply concerned about the divisions that still hold our people apart and our nation back. I believe that our future peace and prosperity depends on whether we meet this moment with honesty and courage.That means taking a hard look at our laws and our attitudes. It means embracing policies that promote justice for all people, and standing firm against any attempt to roll back the clock on the rights and opportunities that so many sacrificed so much to secure.And all of that starts with doing a better job of listening to each other.We need to listen to the families whose loved ones have been killed in police incidents. Alton Sterling and Philando Castile are just the latest in a long and painful litany of African Americans dying after encounters with police officers. We remember Laquan McDonald, killed in Chicago a year and a half ago and Sandra Bland, who grew up in Illinois who died one year ago today. Time after time, no one is held accountable. And surely we can all agree that’s deeply wrong and needs to change.And yes we do need to listen to those who say ‘Black Lives Matter.’ Too many black Americans, especially young men, feel like their lives are disposable. And they worry every single day about what might happen. They have reason to feel that way. And it’s absolutely unacceptable. Everyone in America, everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Surely that is something we can all unite behind.We need to acknowledge the five Latinos who also lost their lives in police incidents last week. Their stories didn’t get national media coverage, but their families and communities are mourning too.And at the same time, we need to listen to the dedicated, principled police officers working hard every day to rebuild trust with the communities they serve and protect. Our men and women in blue put their lives on the line everyday to keep us safe and keep our democracy strong. Remember what Michael Krol, Michael Smith, Lorne Ahrens, Brent Thompson and Patrick Zamarripa were doing when they died. They were protecting a peaceful march. They were people cloaked in authority making sure their fellow citizens could exercise their right to protest authority. And there’s nothing more vital to our democracy than that. And they gave their lives for it.David Brown, the Dallas police chief, said that when it comes to overcoming systemic racism and so many other problems in society, we ask too much of the police and too little of everyone else. I think he’s absolutely right. This is our problem, and we all need to work together to solve it.We also need to listen to the families crying out for relief from gun violence. President Obama’s trip to Dallas yesterday was the 11th time he has spoken to a city in mourning after a mass shooting. The wrong people keep getting their hands on guns. And not just any guns – military weapons, like the kind that the Dallas killer had, which allowed him to outgun the police. And the vast majority of gun owners agree: we have to come together around common sense steps to prevent gun violence. If we’re looking for common ground – this is common ground. And I hope that we will, from Washington, to Springfield to everywhere across America, come to agreement about that.Now I understand that just saying these things together may upset some people. I’m talking about police reform just a few days after a horrific attack on police officers. I’m talking about courageous, honorable police officers just a few days after officer-involved shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota. I’m bringing up guns in a country where just talking about comprehensive background checks and getting assault weapons off our streets gets you demonized.But all these things can be true at the same time.  We do need criminal justice reform to save lives and to make sure all Americans are treated as equals in rights and dignity. We do need to support our police departments that are trying to get it right, and honor the men and women who protect us every day. We do need to do more to stop gun violence. We may disagree about how to do these things, but surely we can all agree with those basic premises. And I hope and pray the past week has showed us how true they are.Now, these are the issues on many of our minds right now. And if we stop there, that would leave us with plenty of work to do.So I wish I could say that was everything that we must address.But these events are taking place against a much broader backdrop of fear and anxiety. So I think we have to face all of it.We do need to make sure our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. The changes that have roiled our economy over the past few decades are not just numbers on a page that economists study. They are real forces that families are dealing with up close and personal every day.Not long ago, I met with factory workers here in Illinois whose jobs are being sent abroad, and heard how painful the consequences have been for them and their families. I’ve talked to workers across our country who’ve seen good jobs lost to technologies, who keep being told to get more training – even though that often doesn’t lead to a good new job on the other end.These economic disruptions have stripped too many people of their sense of security and dignity. And that can have devastating consequences. We have to ask ourselves, why are drug addiction and suicide on the rise in parts of our country? That’s not just about economics. It’s about something deeper, that is connected to economics: a sense of dislocation, even a pessimism about whether America still holds anything for them or cares about them at all.That’s why I’ve pledged that in my first 100 days as President, we will make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. We need more jobs you can support a family on, especially in places that have been left out and left behind from Coal Country to Indian Country to inner cities, to every place that’s been hollowed out when a factory closed or a mine shut down because everyone in America deserves that ‘fair chance in the race of life’ that President Lincoln described.Now, I realize that our politics have contributed to the sense of division many Americans feel right now. And as someone in the middle of a hotly fought political campaign, I cannot stand here and claim that my words and actions haven’t sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of progress. So I recognize I have to do better too.I’m running for President with the belief that we need to face up to these challenges and fix them in order to become a stronger, fairer country. And in times like these, we need a President who can help pull us together, not split us apart.And that is why I believe Donald Trump is so dangerous.His campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes. It is built on stoking mistrust and pitting American against American. It’s there in everything he says and everything he promises to do as President.It’s there in how he wants to ban Muslims from coming to the United States, and toyed with creating a database to track Muslims in America. It’s there in the way he demeans women, in his promotion of an anti-Semitic image pushed by neo-Nazis, and in the months that he spent trying to discredit the citizenship and legitimacy of our first black President. Last night in an interview, he said that he understands systemic bias against black people because – and I quote – ‘even against me, the system is rigged’ – unquote. He went on to say, ‘I can relate to it very much myself.’ Even this – the killing of people – is somehow all about him.It’s there in his proposals on immigration. He says he’ll round up 11 million people and kick them out. He’s actually described a special deportation force that would go around America, pulling people out of their homes and workplaces, pulling children out of school. I got a letter from a mother the other day who said her adopted son asked her with a shaky voice if President Trump would send him back to Ethiopia. When kids are scared by political candidates and policy debates, it’s a sign something has gone badly wrong.And we see it in the violence that Donald Trump encouraged toward protesters at his rallies, and the strange things he has said about the violence that will occur if we don’t elect him. He says that if he doesn’t win this November, we – and again I quote – ‘won’t even have a country anymore,’ America’s ‘not going to continue to survive.’  I do not know what he’s talking about. But I do know we don’t need that kind of fear-mongering – not now, not ever.And he’s gone even further even than that. He has taken aim at some of our most cherished democratic values and institutions. He wants to revoke the citizenship of 4 million Americans born in this country to immigrant parents, and eliminate the bedrock principle enshrined in the 14th Amendment – that if you’re born in America, you’re a citizen of America. He said that a distinguished American, born in Indiana, a judge can’t be trusted to do his job because his parents were Mexican; he called him a ‘Mexican judge’ over and over again. He knew that the judge had been born in Indiana. But it was a cynical, calculated attempt to fan the flames of racial division. And designed to undermine people’s faith in our judicial system. Why would someone running for President want to do that?And even that’s not all. He says, as Commander-in-Chief, he would order our troops to commit war crimes, and insisted they would follow his orders, even though that goes against decades of military training and the military code. He’s banished members of the press who have criticized him – is there any doubt he would do the same as President? Imagine if he had not just Twitter and cable news to go after his critics and opponents, but also the IRS – or for that matter, our entire military. Given what we have seen and heard, do any of us think he’d be restrained?And he has shown contempt for and ignorance of our Constitution. Last week, he met with House Republicans in Washington to try to assuage their serious concerns about him. One member asked whether he’d protect Article I, which defines the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Here’s the answer he reportedly gave: ‘I want to protect Article One, Article Two, Article Twelve.’ Well here’s the thing – there is no Article Twelve – not even close. That was a serious question, from an elected representative, and he either didn’t care enough to answer it seriously – or he didn’t know where to begin.Even the most stalwart Republicans were alarmed by that. And well they, and we, should be.The first thing a new President does is take an oath to ‘protect and defend’ the Constitution. To do that with any meaning, you’ve got to know what’s in it. And you’ve got to respect what’s in it.I do wish Donald Trump would listen to other people once in awhile. He might actually learn something. But he’s made it clear – that’s not his thing. As he has said, he only listens to himself.This man is the nominee of the Party of Lincoln. We are watching it become the Party of Trump. And that’s not just a huge loss for our democracy – it is a threat to it.Because Donald Trump’s campaign adds up to an ugly, dangerous message to America. A message that you should be afraid – afraid of people whose ethnicity is different, or religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country or hold different political beliefs.Make no mistake – there are things to fear in this world, and we need to be clear-eyed about them. But we are each other’s countrymen and women. We share this miraculous country. This land and its heritage is yours, mine and everyone’s – willing to pledge allegiance and understand the solemn responsibilities of American citizenship. That’s what ‘indivisible’ means – that big word that every grade school student knows – that we’re in this together, even if that’s not always easy.So let’s think better of each other. Let’s hold together in the face of our challenges – not turn on each other or tear each other down.Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to a dangerous job we need them to do.Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of African Americans and Latinos, and try as best we can to imagine what it would be like if we had to have ‘the talk’ with our kids about how carefully they need to act because the slightest wrong move could get them hurt or killed.And yes, let’s put ourselves in the shoes of Donald Trump’s supporters. We may disagree on the causes and the solutions to the challenges we face – but I believe like anyone else, they’re trying to figure out their place in a fast-changing America.They want to know how to make a good living and how to give their kids better futures and opportunities. That’s why we’ve got to reclaim the promise of America for all our people – no matter who they vote for.And let’s be more than allies to each other. Let’s take on each other’s struggles as our own.My life’s work is built on the conviction that we are stronger together. Not separated into factions or sides. Not shouting over each other, but together. Our economy is stronger when everyone contributes to it, and everyone can benefit from the work they do. Our communities are stronger when we all pull together to solve our problems and restore our faith in each other, and by doing so in the promise of America. Our country is stronger when we work with our friends and allies to promote peace, prosperity, and security around the world.This is an idea that goes back to the founding of America, when 13 separate colonies found a way – despite their differences – to join together as one nation. They knew they were not stronger on their own, and neither are we.I’ve had the great delight of seeing the musical “Hamilton.” And I hope more people at least get a chance to listen to the score and to hear the words. There’s a great song by the character playing George Washington who sings, ‘History’s eyes are on us.’ That was true then, and that’s true today.If we do this right, and if we have the hard conversations we need to have, we will become stronger still – like steel tempered by fire. Now don’t get me wrong, fierce debates are part of who we are – they started at my dinner table with my father, and have continued ever since. It is who we are. You’re reminded of that when you read history, when you think about the Lincoln-Douglas Debates. Debate over the right way forward.And sometimes we have to balance competing values like freedom and order, justice and security, these are complementary values of American life. That isn’t easy. Previous generations have had to overcome terrible challenges. And no one more so than Abraham Lincoln. But in the end, if we do the work, we will cease to be divided. We, in fact, will be indivisible with liberty and justice for all.And we will remain – in Lincoln’s words – the last, best hope of earth.Thank you all very much.”","Clinton Official"
"34",2016-07-13,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on bridging divides in America","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks in Springfield, Illinois.“Hello! Hi. Thank you all very, very much, please be seated, it’s wonderful being back here. It’s always a special privilege having grown up in Chicago in the suburbs to be here in the state capitol and especially here in this great historic place filled with so much meaning, not just for Illinois but for our country. And I’m delighted to have this opportunity to talk with you about the state of our country today.Nearly 160 years ago, Abraham Lincoln gave a speech in this statehouse that marked a turning point in the political life of our nation.The question of slavery was being fiercely debated across America. Roughly half the states allowed it. Half abolished it. And some people – including Lincoln – believed that until it was gone entirely, our country would never be truly united and at peace.So on June 16, 1858, when Mr. Lincoln kicked off his campaign for the United States Senate, he delivered an address on how slavery was tearing our country apart. And that it must go. Some thought that he ended up losing that Senate race because of that speech. But then he won the Presidency. And some thought it was because of that speech.President Lincoln led America during the most challenging period in our nation’s history. He defended our Union, our Constitution, and the ideal of a nation ‘conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.’ His legacy included laws and amendments that enshrined those values for future generations. They protect and guide us still.I’m here today, in this place, because the words Lincoln spoke all those years ago still hold resonance for us now.Remember, he said, ‘A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect,’ he went on, ‘The Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall. But I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.’The challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincoln’s time. Not even close. And we should be very clear about that.But recent events have left people across America asking hard questions about whether we are still a house divided.Despite our best efforts and highest hopes, America’s long struggle with race is far from finished.  In just the past week, we saw black men killed by police and five police officers killed by a sniper targeting white police. There is too much violence and hate in our country. Too little trust and common ground. It can feel impossible to have the conversations we need to have, to fix what’s broken.And despite being the richest country on earth, we have too much economic inequality – and that also undermines the foundation of our democracy.Lincoln understood that threat, too. He deeply believed everyone deserved – in his words – ‘a fair chance in the race of life.’ He saw it as a defining feature of the United States, and believed it was vital that hard-working people be free to enjoy the fruits of their own labor. It’s one of the reasons he was so strongly against slavery – because it violated that entire notion. And as President, he took pains to use the tools of government to create more economic opportunity for Americans at every level of society. So, too, must we fight inequality and create opportunity in our time – not just for some Americans, but for all.So I come today as a mother and a grandmother to two beautiful little children. Who, I want them and all our children to grow up in a country where violence like the kind we saw last week doesn’t happen again – and where the American Dream is big enough for everyone.I’m also here as a candidate for President who is deeply concerned about the divisions that still hold our people apart and our nation back. I believe that our future peace and prosperity depends on whether we meet this moment with honesty and courage.That means taking a hard look at our laws and our attitudes. It means embracing policies that promote justice for all people, and standing firm against any attempt to roll back the clock on the rights and opportunities that so many sacrificed so much to secure.And all of that starts with doing a better job of listening to each other.We need to listen to the families whose loved ones have been killed in police incidents. Alton Sterling and Philando Castile are just the latest in a long and painful litany of African Americans dying after encounters with police officers. We remember Laquan McDonald, killed in Chicago a year and a half ago and Sandra Bland, who grew up in Illinois who died one year ago today. Time after time, no one is held accountable. And surely we can all agree that’s deeply wrong and needs to change.And yes we do need to listen to those who say ‘Black Lives Matter.’ Too many black Americans, especially young men, feel like their lives are disposable. And they worry every single day about what might happen. They have reason to feel that way. And it’s absolutely unacceptable. Everyone in America, everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Surely that is something we can all unite behind.We need to acknowledge the five Latinos who also lost their lives in police incidents last week. Their stories didn’t get national media coverage, but their families and communities are mourning too.And at the same time, we need to listen to the dedicated, principled police officers working hard every day to rebuild trust with the communities they serve and protect. Our men and women in blue put their lives on the line everyday to keep us safe and keep our democracy strong. Remember what Michael Krol, Michael Smith, Lorne Ahrens, Brent Thompson and Patrick Zamarripa were doing when they died. They were protecting a peaceful march. They were people cloaked in authority making sure their fellow citizens could exercise their right to protest authority. And there’s nothing more vital to our democracy than that. And they gave their lives for it.David Brown, the Dallas police chief, said that when it comes to overcoming systemic racism and so many other problems in society, we ask too much of the police and too little of everyone else. I think he’s absolutely right. This is our problem, and we all need to work together to solve it.We also need to listen to the families crying out for relief from gun violence. President Obama’s trip to Dallas yesterday was the 11th time he has spoken to a city in mourning after a mass shooting. The wrong people keep getting their hands on guns. And not just any guns – military weapons, like the kind that the Dallas killer had, which allowed him to outgun the police. And the vast majority of gun owners agree: we have to come together around common sense steps to prevent gun violence. If we’re looking for common ground – this is common ground. And I hope that we will, from Washington, to Springfield to everywhere across America, come to agreement about that.Now I understand that just saying these things together may upset some people. I’m talking about police reform just a few days after a horrific attack on police officers. I’m talking about courageous, honorable police officers just a few days after officer-involved shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota. I’m bringing up guns in a country where just talking about comprehensive background checks and getting assault weapons off our streets gets you demonized.But all these things can be true at the same time.We do need criminal justice reform to save lives and to make sure all Americans are treated as equals in rights and dignity. We do need to support our police departments that are trying to get it right, and honor the men and women who protect us every day. We do need to do more to stop gun violence. We may disagree about how to do these things, but surely we can all agree with those basic premises.And I hope and pray the past week has showed us how true they are.Now, these are the issues on many of our minds right now. And if we stop there, that would leave us with plenty of work to do.So I wish I could say that was everything that we must address.But these events are taking place against a much broader backdrop of fear and anxiety. So I think we have to face all of it.We do need to make sure our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. The changes that have roiled our economy over the past few decades are not just numbers on a page that economists study. They are real forces that families are dealing with up close and personal every day.Not long ago, I met with factory workers here in Illinois whose jobs are being sent abroad, and heard how painful the consequences have been for them and their families. I’ve talked to workers across our country who’ve seen good jobs lost to technologies, who keep being told to get more training – even though that often doesn’t lead to a good new job on the other end.These economic disruptions have stripped too many people of their sense of security and dignity. And that can have devastating consequences. We have to ask ourselves, why are drug addiction and suicide on the rise in parts of our country? That’s not just about economics. It’s about something deeper, that is connected to economics: a sense of dislocation, even a pessimism about whether America still holds anything for them or cares about them at all.That’s why I’ve pledged that in my first 100 days as President, we will make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. We need more jobs you can support a family on, especially in places that have been left out and left behind from Coal Country to Indian Country to inner cities, to every place that’s been hollowed out when a factory closed or a mine shut down because everyone in America deserves that ‘fair chance in the race of life’ that President Lincoln described.Now, I realize that our politics have contributed to the sense of division many Americans feel right now. And as someone in the middle of a hotly fought political campaign, I cannot stand here and claim that my words and actions haven’t sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of progress. So I recognize I have to do better too.I’m running for President with the belief that we need to face up to these challenges and fix them in order to become a stronger, fairer country. And in times like these, we need a President who can help pull us together, not split us apart.And that is why I believe Donald Trump is so dangerous.His campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes. It is built on stoking mistrust and pitting American against American. It’s there in everything he says and everything he promises to do as President.It’s there in how he wants to ban Muslims from coming to the United States, and toyed with creating a database to track Muslims in America. It’s there in the way he demeans women, in his promotion of an anti-Semitic image pushed by neo-Nazis, and in the months that he spent trying to discredit the citizenship and legitimacy of our first black President. Last night in an interview, he said that he understands systemic bias against black people because – and I quote – ‘even against me, the system is rigged’ – unquote. He went on to say, ‘I can relate to it very much myself.’ Even this – the killing of people – is somehow all about him.It’s there in his proposals on immigration. He says he’ll round up 11 million people and kick them out. He’s actually described a special deportation force that would go around America, pulling people out of their homes and workplaces, pulling children out of school. I got a letter from a mother the other day who said her adopted son asked her with a shaky voice if President Trump would send him back to Ethiopia. When kids are scared by political candidates and policy debates, it’s a sign something has gone badly wrong.And we see it in the violence that Donald Trump encouraged toward protesters at his rallies, and the strange things he has said about the violence that will occur if we don’t elect him. He says that if he doesn’t win this November, we – and again I quote – ‘won’t even have a country anymore,’ America’s ‘not going to continue to survive.’  I do not know what he’s talking about. But I do know we don’t need that kind of fear-mongering – not now, not ever.And he’s gone even further even than that. He has taken aim at some of our most cherished democratic values and institutions. He wants to revoke the citizenship of 4 million Americans born in this country to immigrant parents, and eliminate the bedrock principle enshrined in the 14th Amendment – that if you’re born in America, you’re a citizen of America. He said that a distinguished American, born in Indiana, a judge can’t be trusted to do his job because his parents were Mexican; he called him a ‘Mexican judge’ over and over again. He knew that the judge had been born in Indiana. But it was a cynical, calculated attempt to fan the flames of racial division. And designed to undermine people’s faith in our judicial system. Why would someone running for President want to do that?And even that’s not all. He says, as Commander-in-Chief, he would order our troops to commit war crimes, and insisted they would follow his orders, even though that goes against decades of military training and the military code. He’s banished members of the press who have criticized him – is there any doubt he would do the same as President? Imagine if he had not just Twitter and cable news to go after his critics and opponents, but also the IRS – or for that matter, our entire military. Given what we have seen and heard, do any of us think he’d be restrained?And he has shown contempt for and ignorance of our Constitution. Last week, he met with House Republicans in Washington to try to assuage their serious concerns about him. One member asked whether he’d protect Article I, which defines the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Here’s the answer he reportedly gave: ‘I want to protect Article One, Article Two, Article Twelve.’ Well here’s the thing – there is no Article Twelve – not even close. That was a serious question, from an elected representative, and he either didn’t care enough to answer it seriously – or he didn’t know where to begin.Even the most stalwart Republicans were alarmed by that. And well they, and we, should be.The first thing a new President does is take an oath to ‘protect and defend’ the Constitution. To do that with any meaning, you’ve got to know what’s in it. And you’ve got to respect what’s in it.I do wish Donald Trump would listen to other people once in awhile. He might actually learn something. But he’s made it clear – that’s not his thing. As he has said, he only listens to himself.This man is the nominee of the Party of Lincoln. We are watching it become the Party of Trump. And that’s not just a huge loss for our democracy – it is a threat to it.Because Donald Trump’s campaign adds up to an ugly, dangerous message to America. A message that you should be afraid – afraid of people whose ethnicity is different, or religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country or hold different political beliefs.Make no mistake – there are things to fear in this world, and we need to be clear-eyed about them. But we are each other’s countrymen and women. We share this miraculous country. This land and its heritage is yours, mine and everyone’s – willing to pledge allegiance and understand the solemn responsibilities of American citizenship. That’s what ‘indivisible’ means – that big word that every grade school student knows – that we’re in this together, even if that’s not always easy.So let’s think better of each other. Let’s hold together in the face of our challenges – not turn on each other or tear each other down.Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to a dangerous job we need them to do.Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of African Americans and Latinos, and try as best we can to imagine what it would be like if we had to have ‘the talk’ with our kids about how carefully they need to act because the slightest wrong move could get them hurt or killed.And yes, let’s put ourselves in the shoes of Donald Trump’s supporters. We may disagree on the causes and the solutions to the challenges we face – but I believe like anyone else, they’re trying to figure out their place in a fast-changing America.They want to know how to make a good living and how to give their kids better futures and opportunities. That’s why we’ve got to reclaim the promise of America for all our people – no matter who they vote for.And let’s be more than allies to each other. Let’s take on each other’s struggles as our own.My life’s work is built on the conviction that we are stronger together. Not separated into factions or sides. Not shouting over each other, but together. Our economy is stronger when everyone contributes to it, and everyone can benefit from the work they do. Our communities are stronger when we all pull together to solve our problems and restore our faith in each other, and by doing so in the promise of America. Our country is stronger when we work with our friends and allies to promote peace, prosperity, and security around the world.This is an idea that goes back to the founding of America, when 13 separate colonies found a way – despite their differences – to join together as one nation. They knew they were not stronger on their own, and neither are we.I’ve had the great delight of seeing the musical “Hamilton.” And I hope more people at least get a chance to listen to the score and to hear the words. There’s a great song by the character playing George Washington who sings, ‘History’s eyes are on us.’ That was true then, and that’s true today.If we do this right, and if we have the hard conversations we need to have, we will become stronger still – like steel tempered by fire. Now don’t get me wrong, fierce debates are part of who we are – they started at my dinner table with my father, and have continued ever since. It is who we are. You’re reminded of that when you read history, when you think about the Lincoln-Douglas Debates. Debate over the right way forward.And sometimes we have to balance competing values like freedom and order, justice and security, these are complementary values of American life. That isn’t easy. Previous generations have had to overcome terrible challenges. And no one more so than Abraham Lincoln. But in the end, if we do the work, we will cease to be divided. We, in fact, will be indivisible with liberty and justice for all.And we will remain – in Lincoln’s words – the last, best hope of earth.Thank you all very much.”","Clinton Official"
"35",2016-07-12,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at an event with Senator Bernie Sanders in Portsmouth, New Hampshire","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at an event with Senator Bernie Sanders in Portsmouth, New HampshireThank you! That was so great. Hello, New Hampshire! It is so great, it is so great to be here with so many friends, old and new.  to be back with so many friends old and new.Thank you! Thank you so much. I have to say it is such a great privilege to be here with Senator Sanders. Being here with him and New Hampshire, I can’t help but reflect on how much more enjoyable this election is going to be now that we’re on the same side. Because you know what? We are stronger together.And I want to give a special thanks to someone who has been with Senator Sanders every step of the way, not just throughout this campaign but over the years, his wonderful wife, Jane Sanders. And also I’ve had the pleasure of meeting his son, Levi Sanders! Thank you!I also appreciate greatly having the opportunity for all of us to hear from the speakers beforehand, Governor Maggie Hassan, the next Senator from the state of New Hampshire!Senator Jeanne Shaheen who is doing a tremendous job for you.And we are delighted to have heard from and to have with us Bill McKibben and Jim Dean.Over these last few weeks, Bernie and I have worked together on plans to put college within reach for more people, and to ensure that everyone in America has access to quality, affordable health care. And now, with your help, we are joining forces to defeat Donald Trump, win in November, and yes, together build a future we can all believe in. Just as Bernie said, over the years, I’ve gotten to know him as a colleague and a friend. His reputation for passionate advocacy hasn’t always made him the most popular person in Washington. But you know what? That’s generally a sign you’re doing something right. Throughout this campaign Senator Sanders has brought people off the sidelines and into the political process. He has energized and inspired a generation of young people who care deeply about our country, and are building a movement that is bigger than one candidate or one campaign. So thank you, thank you Bernie – for your endorsement, but more than that, thank you for your  lifetime of fighting injustice. I am proud to be fighting alongside you because my friends, this is a time for all of us to stand together. These have been difficult times for America.This is a time for all of us to stand together – because these have been difficult days for our country. Taking on the systemic racism that plagues our country – and rebuilding the frayed bonds of trust and respect between law enforcement and the communities they serve – will require contributions from all of us. And we have to begin by starting to listen to each other. And more than that, we then have to do something that will help us fix these problems.We have to reform our broken criminal justice system, take back our democracy from the wealthy special interests, and make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. And you know what? We have to do all these things at the same time. That’s why throughout this campaign, we’ve been calling for eliminating racial profiling and disparities in sentencing. Ending the era of mass incarceration, dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline, providing more employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated people.In addition to that, I am proposing two new steps that get law enforcement the support they need while also stopping the tragedy, the tragedy of black men and women – and black children – being killed in police incidents. First, let’s bring law enforcement and the communities they swear to protect and serve together to develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers.And second, let’s provide better training on implicit bias, that remains a problem even in our best police departments but it also remains a problem across our society. I’m asking for all of us to really search our hearts and minds to make sure that we don’t have those implicit biases. Let’s learn from police departments like Dallas that had made strong progress, and apply their lessons nationwide. Because everyone in every community benefits when there is respect for the law and when everyone is respected by the law.Remember, when gunfire broke out in Dallas, the peaceful protestors and the crowds that had gathered to support them ran to safety, while the police officers – who just minutes before had been talking with and taking pictures with and protecting the protesters – the police officers ran the other way – they ran into the gunfire. That’s the kind of courage and dedication our police and first responders show every single day.So yes – let’s take real, meaningful action to end the epidemic of gun violence in America. From Sandy Hook to Orlando to Dallas, and so many other places, these tragedies tear at our soul. And so do the incidents that don’t even dominate the headlines. Just this past Sunday, a young man, Seth Rich, who worked for the Democratic National Committee to expand voting rights, was shot and killed in his neighborhood in Washington. He was just 27 years old.Surely we can agree that weapons of war have no place on the streets of America. Our police and first responders should never have to face a madman, a racist, a person filled with hatred, with an assault weapon. We owe it to every officer who puts his or her life on the line to protect us – so let’s protect them. And we can’t stop there. This is part of a broader challenge across our country. Inequality is too high, wages are too low, and it is just too hard to get ahead for too many Americans.We need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. Not just the millionaires and billionaires but everybody. And to do that, we need to go big and we need to go bold. This isn’t a time for half measures. So we are setting five ambitious goals.For starters, in my first 100 days as President, we will make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. More jobs here in New Hampshire and across our country, especially in places that have been left out and left behind. In communities of color. In coal country. Indian Country. Everywhere where a person deserves the same shot at the American Dream as anybody else in our country. And when I say good-paying jobs, I mean it. As Bernie said, Donald Trump thinks wages are too high. He actually stood on a debate stage and said so. He does want to get rid of the federal minimum wage altogether.Well, both Senator Sanders and I believe anyone who is willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well enough to support a family. And Bernie is right – $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage. So sorry Donald, if you’re watching, we’re not cutting the minimum wage – we’re raising the minimum wage.We’re going to create millions of good jobs by making America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. As Bernie reminds us so powerfully, we owe it to future generations to work together to combat climate change.  And we’re going to do it. We’ve got the intelligence. We’ve got the innovation. We’re going to roll up our sleeves and demonstrate to the world what America is made of. We’re going to have that clean energy economy. We’re going to make it work for everybody.And make no mistake – we will defend American jobs and American workers by saying “no” to the assaults on the right to organize and bargain collectively. And we’re going to say “no” to attacks on working families and “no” to bad trade deals and unfair trade practices, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Second, we’re going to make college debt-free for all and help millions of people struggling with existing student debt save thousands of dollars.Here in New Hampshire, students are carrying one of the highest debt loads in the country. I’ve heard from young people who can’t start a business, move out of their parents’ home, or even get married because of all the student debt holding them back.So with your help, we’re going to make it so future students won’t have to borrow a dime to attend public colleges or universities. Thanks to the new proposal Senator Sanders and I worked on together, for families making less than $125,000 a year, we will eliminate tuition at those schools altogether. And we will do more to help students cover all the costs of getting an education – including books, supplies, and living expenses. Because in the words of a student I met here in New Hampshire, “paying for college shouldn’t be the hardest thing about going to college.”Third, we’re going to rewrite the rules, and crack down on companies that ship jobs and profits overseas. Let’s reward the companies that share profits with their employees instead. And we will defend and strengthen the tough reforms President Obama put in place on the financial industry – not let Donald Trump tear them up. Because we do, we do need to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again.Number four, we’re going to make sure Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich pay their fair share of taxes. When people say the game is rigged, the best evidence is our tax code. It is riddled with scams, loopholes, and special breaks. It is wrong that some millionaires do pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries, and we’re going to stop it.Now compare what Senator Sanders and I intend to do with Donald Trump’s tax plan. His tax plan would make our current system even worse. Independent analysts say he would add $30 trillion to the national debt in order to give a massive gift to the wealthiest Americans, Wall Street money managers, and our largest corporations. But after all, what else should we expect from someone who calls himself “the King of Debt”?Now we have been pointing out the problems with his tax plan for months. And  I think Donald is starting to feel the pressure.In fact, even as we speak, he’s apparently bringing in the biggest names in trickle-down, supply-side economics to help him figure out what to do – now these are the same advisors who brought us 30 years of a disastrous Republican philosophy that gave the huge breaks to those at the top.Now you don’t have to be psychic to know what’s going to happen next: they’re going to come back with another plan with maybe some bells and whistles, Bernie, that tries to disguise the fact that they still are slashing taxes for the wealthy, large corporations, and Donald Trump himself. And they’ll try to use voodoo economics to tell us all the ways it will actually help the economy. But they’re not fooling anybody, at least I hope they’re not. Just like his current plan – which he calls “inspiring,” “tremendous,” and “amazing” – you know, he uses a lot of adjectives to avoid telling you any specifics. Here’s what we know for sure: whatever he comes out with next is going to give huge tax cuts to the corporations and the rich at the expense of the middle class.Now there’s that old saying, you’ve heard it, I used to hear it a lot in Arkansas, you can put lipstick on a pig – but it’s still a pig.And I’ve got to tell you, the first time that the Republicans pulled the voodoo economics, you know, they fooled us. Shame on them. But if they come back with the same argument and people fall for it, shame on us. But I will promise you this, Senator Sanders and I will spare no effort to make sure the people of America know that once again Trump and his cronies are trying to pull the wool over our eyes and come back with the same failed policies that hurt us before.We’re not going to let them get away with it again.And finally, our fifth goal is we’re going to step up and respond to the way American families actually live and work in the 21st century. Our families and our workplaces have changed, so isn’t it time for our policies to change too?Let’s expand Social Security to match today’s realities, not cut or privatize it.Let’s join the rest of the developed world and offer paid family leave.And finally, let’s guarantee equal pay for women once and for all.I can just envision the tweets Donald is putting together. And Donald Trump can accuse me of playing “the woman card” all he wants. If fighting for equal pay and paid family leave is playing the woman card, then deal me in.And I’ll tell you, these aren’t just my fights. These are Bernie’s fights. These are America’s fights. And I feel with all my being, these are fights we have to wage and win together.As Bernie and his supporters have argued so eloquently, we won’t get anywhere unless we overhaul our campaign finance system.It is past time to end the stranglehold of wealthy special interests in Washington, and get back to government of the people, by the people, and for the people. That’s why as president from my very first days, I’ll make campaign finance reform a top priority. We will do everything we can to overturn Citizens United. And we will require everybody – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, whoever – to disclose their donors.And while we’re at it, we are going to create a small-donor matching system to make it easy for more Americans to be elected at every level of government. Because just like Bernie, I’ve met so many people here in New Hampshire with great ideas for our country. I want to see you run for office and win.And here’s another radical idea: Let’s make it easier to vote, not harder. Let’s fight back against attacks on voting rights across the country – attacks that disproportionately affect low-income voters, people of color, students, the elderly, and women. That means we need to restore the Voting Rights Act and then keep going. All Americans should be automatically registered to vote on their 18th birthday. Every state should have at least 20 days of in-person voting. And no one in America should ever have to wait more than 30 minutes to cast their ballot. So Senator Sanders and I will be working to get unaccountable money out of politics and the voices of everyday Americans back in.Because as Bernie has said: This isn’t a progressive issue. It’s not a conservative issue. It’s an American issue.And let me close with this: To everyone here and everyone across the country who poured your heart and soul into Senator Sanders’ campaign, thank you. Thank you. I was proud of the campaign we ran, it was a campaign about issues not insults. And our country desperately needs your voices and involvement and so does this campaign and so does the Democratic Party. Because you know what? we need to take back the Senate and take back the House and make sure we have Democratic governors and Democratic state legislators. Let’s open the doors to everyone who shares our progressive values.This is one of the most important elections in our lifetimes. So I’m asking you to stand with us.  And then, I’m asking you to keep working with me in the weeks, months, and, yes, years ahead. You will always have a seat at the table when I’m in the White House.As Bernie will tell you, talk is cheap. We need to keep fighting to make sure everything we’ve stood for is real in the lives of people across America.This amazing country of ours is worthy of our best efforts. This election, let’s send a clear message: In America, we don’t tear each other down – we lift each other up. We build bridges, not walls. We put common interest ahead of self-interest.

"36",2016-07-11,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the African Methodist Episcopal Church National Convention"," Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at the African Methodist Episcopal Church National Convention in Philadelphia, PAGiving all praise and honor to God.Thank you for that welcome, and for letting me be a part of this anniversary celebration for the AME Church. I want to thank Bishop Green as well as Bishop Bryant, Bishop White, Bishop Ingram, Bishop Young, Bishop McKenzie, Bishop Jackson, Dr. Richard Allen Lewis, Sr., Reverend Dr. Jeffery B. Cooper, Sr., Bishop Snorton, Reverend Vincent and the AME General Conference Choir, which I had the great pleasure of hearing from backstage.There is no better place to mark this milestone for the AME Church than right here in Philadelphia, the city where this church was founded by a former slave 200 years ago.Today, we join to celebrate your esteemed history, the leaders and congregants who built this community and kept it strong, and your legacy of service. You seek to meet what the Book of Micah tells us are the Lord’s requirements for each of us: “To do justice, love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.”As President Obama has said, the church is the “beating heart” of the African American community. This is the place where people worship, study, grieve and rejoice without fear of persecution or mistreatment. That is a precious thing, my friends, in this world. I know that, from my experience as a lifelong Methodist, how important my own church community has been to me.So I come here today, first and foremost, to say thank you. Thank you for being part of this historic institution, and for carrying its work forward, as Bishop Green said. I also come tonight as a mother, and a grandmother to two beautiful little children. And like so many parents and grandparents across America, I have been following the news of the past few days with horror and grief.On Tuesday, Alton Sterling, father of five, was killed in Baton Rouge — approached by the police for selling CDs outside a convenience store. On Wednesday, Philando Castile, 32 years old, was killed outside St. Paul — pulled over by the police for a broken tail light. And last night in Dallas, during a peaceful protest related to those killings, there was a vicious, appalling attack. A sniper targeted police officers. He said he wanted to hurt white people. Twelve officers were shot, along with two civilians. Five — five — officers have died. We now know all their names: Brent Thompson, Michael Krol, Michael Smith, Lorne Ahrens, and Patrick Zamarripa. And as I was on my way here today, we heard reports of another shooting yesterday morning in Tennessee.What can one say about events like these? What can people and leaders of faith say about events like these? It’s hard, isn’t it, even to know where to start. But let’s start here — let’s take a moment to pray for all the families and the loved ones suffering today. For Alton’s grieving children. For the four-year-old girl who bravely comforted her mother while Philando died in front of them. For the families of those police officers who lived every day with the fear that something like this could happen, and will always be proud of their service and sacrifice.We pray for those families, and for the souls of everyone we lost this week and in all weeks preceding. May they rest in God’s peace.Now, there are many unanswered questions about each of these incidents. We will learn more in the days ahead. And when we know as much as we can, there must be a just accounting.For now, let’s focus on what we already know — deep in our hearts. We know there is something wrong with our country. There is too much violence, too much hate, too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be. And we know there is clear evidence that African Americans are much more likely to be killed in police incidents than any other group of Americans.And we know there is too little trust in too many places between police and the communities they are sworn to protect. With so little common ground, it can feel impossible to have the conversations we need to have, to begin fixing what’s broken. We owe our children better than this. We owe ourselves better than this.No one has all the answers. We need to find them together. Indeed, that is the only way we can find them. Those are the truest things I can offer today. We must do better, together. Let’s begin with something simple but vital: listening to each other. For Scripture tells us to “incline our ears to wisdom and apply our hearts to understanding.”The deaths of Alton and Philando are the latest in a long and painful litany of African Americans killed in police incidents — 123 so far this year alone. We know the names of other victims, too:Tamir Rice.Sandra Bland.Walter Scott.Dontre Hamilton.Laquan McDonald.Eric Garner.Michael Brown.Freddie Gray.Brandon Tate-Brown, whose mother Tanya is here today, and who was killed not far from here a year and a half ago.Tragically, we could go on and on, couldn’t we. The families of the lost are trying to tell us. We need to listen. People are crying out for criminal justice reform. Families are being torn apart by excessive incarceration. Young people are being threatened and humiliated by racial profiling. Children are growing up in homes shattered by prison and poverty.They’re trying to tell us. We need to listen.Brave police officers are working hard every day to inspire trust and confidence. As we mourn the Dallas police officers who died and pray for those wounded, let’s not forget how the Dallas Police Department in particular has earned a reputation for excellence. They’ve worked hard for years to improve policing and strengthen their bonds with the community. And they’ve gotten results.Police officers across the country are pouring their hearts into this work, because they know how vital it is to the peace, tranquility, justice, and equality of America. They’re trying to tell us. And we need to listen.People are crying out for relief from gun violence. We remember Reverend Clementa Pinckney, eight congregants at Mother Emanuel in Charleston — and thousands more killed every year by guns across our nation. Things have become so broken in Washington that to just try to get a vote on compromise gun safety reforms, John Lewis himself had to stage a sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives.Gun violence is ripping apart people’s lives. They’re trying to tell us. And we need to listen.I know that, just by saying all these things together, I may upset some people. I’m talking about criminal justice reform the day after a horrific attack on police officers. I’m talking about courageous, honorable police officers just a few days after officer-involved killings in Louisiana and Minnesota. I’m bringing up guns in a country where merely talking about comprehensive background checks and getting assault weapons off our streets gets you demonized.But all these things can be true at once. We do need police and criminal justice reforms, to save lives and make sure all Americans are treated equally in rights and dignity. We do need to support police departments and stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect us. And we do need to reduce gun violence. We may disagree about how to do all these things, but surely we can all agree with those basic premises. Surely this week showed us how true they are.Now, I have set forth plans for over a year to reduce excessive violence, reform our sentencing laws, support police departments that are doing things right, make it harder for the wrong people to get their hands on guns. For example, there are two important steps that I will take as president.First, I will bring law enforcement and communities together to develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers. We will make it clear for everyone to see when deadly force is warranted, and when it isn’t. And we will emphasize proven methods for de-escalating situations before they reach that point.And second, let’s be honest — let’s acknowledge that implicit bias still exists across our society and even in the best police departments. We have to tackle it together, which is why in my first budget, I will commit $1 billion to find and fund the best training programs, support new research, and make this a national policing priority. Let’s learn from those police departments like Dallas that have been making progress, apply their lessons nationwide.Now, plans like these are important. But we have to acknowledge that — on their own — they won’t be enough. On their own, our thoughts and prayers aren’t enough, either. We need to do some hard work inside ourselves, too.Today, there are people all across America sick over what happened in Dallas, and fearful that the murders of these police officers will mean that vital questions raised by Alton’s and Philando’s deaths will go unanswered. That is a reasonable fear. Today, there are people all across America who watched what happened in Dallas last night and are thinking, no frustration with the police could ever justify this bloodshed. How did we get here? And is there more to come? That’s a reasonable fear, too..It is up to all of us to make sure those fears don’t come true. We cannot, we must not vilify police officers. Remember what those officers were doing when they died. They were protecting a peaceful march. They were people in authority, making sure their fellow citizens had the right to protest authority. And there is nothing more vital to our democracy than that. And they died for it.Ending the systemic racism that plagues our country — and rebuilding our communities where the police and citizens all see themselves as being on the same side — will require contributions from all of us. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk— talk about the seen and unseen barriers you face every day. We need to try, as best we can, to walk in one another’s shoes — to imagine what it would be like if people followed us around stores, or locked their car doors when we walked past. Or if every time our children went to play in the park, or went for a ride, or just to the store to buy iced tea and Skittles, we said a prayer — “Please, God — please, God — don’t let anything happen to my baby.”And let’s put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to a dangerous job we need them to do. When gunfire broke out yesterday night, and everyone ran to safety, the police officers ran the other way — into the gunfire. That’s the kind of courage our police and first responders show every single day somewhere across America. And let’s remember — let’s think about what Dallas Police Chief David Brown said this morning. He said, “Please join me in applauding these brave men and women, who do this job under great scrutiny, under great vulnerability, who literally risk their lives to protect our democracy.” He went on to say, “We don’t feel much support most days. Let’s not make today most days.”Let’s remember that — not just today but every day.Let’s ask ourselves, what can I do? What can I personally do to stop violence and promote justice? How can I show that your life matters to me? That I have a stake in your safety and wellbeing?Elie Wiesel, who died last week, once clarified for us that “the opposite of love is not hate — it’s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death — it’s indifference.” None of us can afford to be indifferent toward each other — not now, not ever. And I’m going to keep talking about these issues with every audience. And if I’m elected, I’ll start working on this on day one — and keep at it every single day after that.I want you to know the 24-hour news cycle moves on — I won’t. This is so important to who we are, what kind of nation we are making for our children and our grandchildren. As President Obama said yesterday, and as we all know in our hearts to be true: We are better than this. And if we push hard enough, and long enough, we can bend the arc of history toward justice. We can avoid that choice that Dr. King posed for us between chaos and community.So yes, this is about our country. It’s also about our kids. There’s nothing more important than that. And I think it’s about our faith. We have a lot of work to do. We don’t have a moment to lose. But I would not be here tonight if I did not believe we can come together with a sense of shared purpose and belief in our shared humanity, and if I did not know we must, because truly we are stronger together. Not separated into factions or sides; not shouting over each other about who matters more or who has more cause to be upset; but together, facing these challenges together. And if we do this right and have the hard conversations we need to have, we will become even stronger — like steel tempered by fire.Fierce debates are part of who we are — just like freedom and order, justice and security — complementary values of American life. They are not easy. They challenge us to dig deep, and constantly seek the right balance. But in the end, if we do that work, we will become a better nation. If we stand with each other now, we can build a future where no one is left out or left behind, and everyone can share in the promise of America — which is big enough for everyone, not to be reserved for a few.But we know something — we know that work is hard, don’t we? I’m calling on this historic church, and all of our churches, to think hard about what special role you can play. Every day, you teach and show us about the Golden Rule and so much else. Why can’t we really believe in and act on it? To treat others as we would want to be treated.In the 13th chapter of First Corinthians, St. Paul extols the virtues of faith, hope, and love for our fellow human beings. He says we need them all in this life, because of our imperfections: we “see through a glass darkly” and only “know in part.” He proclaims love the greatest virtue, necessary to keep faith and hope alive and to give us direction.I’ve tried to say for some time now that our country needs more love and kindness. I know it’s not the kind of thing presidential candidates usually say. But we have to find ways to repair these wounds and close these divides. The great genius and salvation of the United States is our capacity to do and to be better. And we must answer the call to do that again. It’s critical to everything else we want to achieve — more jobs with rising income; good education no matter what ZIP code a child lives in; affordable college; paying back debts; health care for everyone. We must never give up on the dream of this nation.I want to close with a favorite passage — a passage that you all know — that means a great deal to me and I’m sure to many of you, from Galatians. “Let us not grow weary in doing good” — “for in due season, we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.”My friends, let us not grow weary. Let us plan the path forward for all of God’s children. There are lost lives to redeem, bright futures to claim. Let us go forth — go forward, Bishop — with a sense of heartfelt love and commitment. And may the memory of those we’ve lost light our way toward the future our children and grandchildren deserve.Thank you, AME, and God bless you.","Clinton Official"
"37",2016-07-05,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at an event with President Obama in Charlotte, North Carolina","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at an event with President Obama in Charlotte, North Carolina.Thank you so much. Hello Charlotte. It’s great to be back in North Carolina with so many friends:With Congresswoman Alma Adams, and Congressman David Price, and Congressman G.K. Butterfield.And your next U.S. Senator, Deborah Ross.And your next Governor, Roy Cooper. And of course, with our president, Barack Obama.I feel very privileged because I’ve known the President in many roles. As a colleague in the Senate. As an opponent in a hard-fought primary. And as the President I was so proud to serve as Secretary of State. But I’ve also known him as the friend that I was honored to stand with in good times and hard times. Someone who has never forgotten where he came from. And Donald, if you’re out there tweeting, it’s Hawaii.Over the years, we’ve had some memorable experiences together – like storming a secret meeting of foreign leaders at a global climate summit. That was fun. You should have seen the Chinese guards try to stop us. Now, they put their arms out and the President just went right through. Then they put their arms out, and I went right under. And the President, with that amazing smile of his, said, “Hey, we’ve been looking for you.”Now through it all, as we went from rivals to partners to friends, my esteem for him just kept growing.  So did my admiration for his brilliant wife, Michelle, and those two amazing daughters that they have raised. My husband and I know how hard it is to raise a child in the public eye, in the fishbowl of the White House. But the Obamas have done a fabulous job. Malia – who just graduated from high school and celebrated her 18th birthday yesterday – and Sasha who has the energy and enthusiasm of a wonderful young woman. Now I happen to think those two young woman might be the most impressive accomplishment of all for our President. Now it means so much to have the President’s support in this campaign. After all, he knows a thing or two about winning elections – take it from me.And he also knows that despite all the progress we’ve made under his leadership, and yes we have, we still have a lot of work to do.President Obama’s job, one that he did not ask for but was handed to him, was to save us from a second Great Depression – and that is exactly what he did.  Actually, I don’t think he gets the credit he deserves for saving our economy.We’ve added 14 million private-sector jobs. The auto industry just had its best year ever. 20 million people now have health care. Clean energy production has soared. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. That’s what leadership looks like.Our next president has a different job to do – building on the progress that President Obama has made. We have to continue to take on deep structural challenges that existed long before the crisis. We can see it here in North Carolina and across the country: inequality is too high, wages are too low, and it’s just too hard to get ahead.We need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.So we’re setting five big, ambitious goals.First, under President Obama and Vice President Biden, we’ve had 75 straight months of job growth. I want us to see 75 more. So in my first 100 days as President, we’ll make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.And when I say good-paying jobs, I mean exactly that. Donald Trump thinks wages are too high.  He actually stood on the debate stage and said that. He wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage altogether.Well, I think anyone who is willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well enough to raise a family. So we’re going to increase the federal minimum wage, and give the middle class a raise. That’s good for our families, good for our economy, and boy is it good for our country.Second, we’re going to make college debt-free for all. And we’re going to build on the President’s idea to make community college free. And we’re going to help millions of people struggling with existing student debt save thousands of dollars. Third, we’re going to rewrite the rules, and crack down on companies that ship jobs overseas and profits to go with them. Let’s reward the companies that share profits with their employees instead.And we’re going to defend and strengthen the tough reforms President Obama put in place on the financial industry – not tear them up like Donald Trump says he’ll do. We need to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street ever again.Fourth, we’re going to make sure that Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich pay their fair share of taxes. It is just plain wrong that a millionaire can pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries, and we’re going to stop it. And oh, by the way, we’re going to keep asking to see Donald Trump’s tax returns.And finally, we’re going to step up and respond to the way American families actually live and work in the 21st century. Our families, our workplaces have changed, so isn’t it time for our policies to change?Donald Trump can accuse me of playing “the woman card” all he wants, but if fighting for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the woman card, then deal me in.Most of all, most of all– most of all though, we’re going to build on the vision for America that President Obama has always championed – a vision for a future where we do great things together, not as red states and blue states but as the United States.When I look at President Obama, I see a leader with heart, depth, and humility. Someone who, in spite of the obstruction he’s faced, still reaches for common ground and common purpose.Some of you might remember, that he and I competed against each other as hard as we could back in 2008. But when it was over, I was proud to endorse him and campaign for him.And I’ll never forget when he called me the Sunday after the election, asking me to come to Chicago. It turned out he wanted me to be Secretary of State, and I don’t think anybody saw that coming – especially me.And as I travelled on behalf of our country, a lot of people around the world asked how President Obama and I could work so well together after being such fierce competitors. In some places, the person who loses an election gets exiled or executed, not asked to be Secretary of State.But President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted. You know why? We both love our country.That is how democracy is supposed to work. We just celebrated 240 years of independence. In America, we put common interest before self-interest. We stand together because we know we’re stronger together.That’s the kind of president Barack Obama has been. He’s made difficult, even unpopular decisions for the good of our country. I have sat with him in the Situation Room and seen him make the hardest choices a president faces. He does it with steady, principled leadership. He’s a statesman, leading not just our country but the entire world. It was his vision, it was his vision and diplomacy that secured a historic global agreement on climate change, put a lid on Iran’s nuclear program, opened up Cuba, and rallied the world to curb the spread of nuclear weapons. I saw him go toe-to-toe with the toughest foreign leaders, and to give the order to go after Osama bin Laden. This, my friends, is a president who knows how to keep us safe and strong.Compare that to Donald Trump. Can you imagine him sitting in the Oval Office the next time America faces a crisis? The world hangs on every word our President says, and Donald Trump is simply unqualified and temperamentally unfit to be our President and Commander-in-Chief.So here in North Carolina this election is our chance to say, “Our country is better than this.” In America, we don’t tear each other down, we lift each other up. We build bridges, not walls. We don’t call the country we love a disaster or a laughing stock – we know America already is the greatest country on earth.Just think about those early patriots who met in Philadelphia that hot summer of 1776. They knew we would all rise or fall together.Nobody who looked like Barack Obama – or me – would have been included back then. But we’re here today because the story of America is the story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. So, I want you to remember that for 240 years, our history has moved in that direction – slowly at times, but unmistakably. As the President has reminded us, the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.So if you believe, along with me and the President, that our best days as a nation are still ahead of us, please, join us in this campaign. Take out your phone right now. Take out your phone and text JOIN to 47246. Or go to hillaryclinton.com. We are hiring organizers right here in North Carolina.We’re going to fight for every vote in this state, and with your help, we’re going to win it. So, I don’t know about you but we are fired up and ready to go. Ready to win this election. Please join me in welcoming the President of the United States, Barack Obama.","Clinton Official"
"38",2016-07-01,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on securing the Democratic nomination","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at the Brooklyn Navy Yard after securing the democratic nominationThank you all! Tonight caps an amazing journey. A really, really long journey.It’s wonderful to be back in Brooklyn, here in this beautiful building. It may be hard to see, but we’re all standing under a glass ceiling right now– don’t worry, we’re not smashing this one.Thanks to you, we’ve reached a milestone– the first time in our history that a woman will be a major party’s nominee for President of the United States.Tonight’s victory is not about one person. It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible.Tonight belongs to all of you.I want to thank all the volunteers, community leaders, activists, and organizers who supported our campaign in every state and territory. Thank you for talking to your neighbors and for making contributions to hillaryclinton.com. Your efforts have produced a strong majority of the popular vote, victories in a majority of the contests, and after tonight, a majority of pledged delegates.I also want to thank all the people across this country who’ve taken the time to talk with me. I’ve learned a lot from you about the persistent problems and the unfinished promise of America. So many of you feel like you’re out there on your own, and no one has your backs. Well, I do. I hear you, I see you, and if I’m fortunate enough to serve as your president, I’ll always have your back.I want to congratulate Senator Sanders for the extraordinary campaign he has run. He’s spent his career fighting for progressive causes and principles, and he’s excited millions of voters, especially young people. Let there be no mistake: Senator Sanders, his campaign, and the vigorous debate we’ve had about how to raise incomes, reduce inequality, and increase upward mobility have been very good for the Democratic Party and for America.This has been a hard-fought, deeply-felt campaign. But whether you supported me, or Senator Sanders, or one of the Republicans, we all need to keep working toward a better, fairer, stronger America.It never feels good to put your heart into a cause or a candidate you believe in– and to come up short.I know that feeling well.But, as we look ahead to the battle that awaits, let’s remember all that unites us.We all want an economy with more opportunity and less inequality, where Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again. We all want a government that listens to the people, not the power brokers, which means getting unaccountable money out of politics. And we all want a society that is tolerant, inclusive, and fair.We all believe that America succeeds when more people share in our prosperity. When more people have a voice in our political system. When more people can contribute to our communities.We believe that cooperation is better than conflict, unity is better than division, empowerment is better than resentment, and bridges are better than walls.It’s a simple but powerful idea. We believe we are stronger together.The stakes in this election are high. And the choice is clear.Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president and Commander-in-Chief. And he’s not just trying to build a wall between America and Mexico– he’s trying to wall off Americans from each other.When he says, “Let’s make America great again,” that’s code for “let’s take America backward.”Back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some, not all. Promising his supporters an economy he can’t recreate.We want to write the next chapter in American greatness, with a 21st-century prosperity that lifts everyone who’s been left out and left behind, including those who may not vote for us but who deserve their chance to make a new beginning.When Donald Trump says a distinguished judge born in Indiana can’t do his job because of his Mexican heritage, or mocks a reporter with disabilities, or calls women “pigs,” it goes against everything we stand for. We want an America where everyone is treated with respect and their work is valued.Donald Trump doesn’t believe we are stronger together. He has abused his primary opponents and their families, attacked the press for asking tough questions, and denigrated Muslims and immigrants.  He wants to win by stoking fear and rubbing salt in wounds. And reminding us daily just how great he is.We believe we should lift each other up, not tear each other down.We need to give America a raise– not complain that hard-working people’s wages are too high.We need to help young people struggling with student debt– not pile more on to our national debt with giveaways to the super-wealthy.We need to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century, not insist that climate change is a hoax.To be great, we can’t be small. We have to be as big as the values that define America.And we are a big-hearted, fair-minded country. We teach our children that this is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way. For all. Indivisible.This election isn’t about the same old fights between Democrats and Republicans. This election is different. It’s about who we are as a nation. It’s about millions of Americans coming together to say: We are better than this. We won’t let this happen in America.If you agree– whether you’re a Democrat, Republican or independent– I hope you’ll join us.In just a few weeks, we’ll meet in Philadelphia, which gave birth to our nation in that hot summer of 1776. Those early patriots knew they’d all rise or fall together. Today, that’s more true than ever.Our campaign will take this message to every corner of the country.We’re stronger when our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top, with good-paying jobs and good schools in every zip code, and a real commitment to all families and all regions of our country.We’re stronger when we work with our allies around the world to keep us safe.We’re stronger when we respect each other, listen to each other, and act with a sense of common purpose.We’re stronger when every family in every community knows they’re not on their own, because we’re all in this together. It really does “take a village”– to raise a child and to build a stronger future for us all.I learned this a long time ago, from the biggest influence in my life: my mother.She was my rock, from the day I was born till the day she left us. She overcame a childhood marked by abandonment and mistreatment, and somehow managed not to become bitter or broken. Mom believed that life is about serving others. And she taught me never to back down from a bully, which it turns out was pretty good advice.This past Saturday would have been her 97th birthday. She was born on June 4, 1919. Some of you may know that date. On the very day Mom was being born in Chicago, Congress was passing the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, giving women the right to vote.I wish Mom could be here tonight. I wish she could see what a wonderful mother Chelsea has become. I wish she could meet our beautiful granddaughter Charlotte.And I wish she could see her daughter become the Democratic Party’s nominee for president of the United States.Yes, there are still ceilings to break– for women and men, for all Americans. But don’t let anyone tell you that great things can’t happen in America. Barriers can come down. Justice and equality can win. Our history has moved in that direction— slowly at times, but unmistakably– thanks to generations of Americans who refused to give up or back down.You are writing a new chapter of that story. This campaign is about making sure there are no ceiling — no limits— on any of us.And this is our moment to come together.Go to hillaryclinton.com and contribute what you can.  Text JOIN to 47246 and help us organize in all 50 states. Every phone call you make and every door you knock will help move us forward.I’m going to take a moment later tonight to sit and fully absorb the history we’ve made here. But what I care about most is the history our country has yet to write. Our children and grandchildren will look back at this time, at the choices we’re about to make, the goals we will strive for, the principles we will live by. We need to make sure they can be proud of us.The end of the primaries is only the beginning of the work we’re called to do.If we stand together, we’ll grow together, and rise together.Because we’re stronger together.Thank you all. May God bless you and may God bless America.","Clinton Official"
"39",2016-06-23,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks on building an economy that works for everyone","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks in Raleigh, North Carolina.Thank you, It’s great to be back in Raleigh! Thank you so much. I have to confess I was having such a good time backstage listening to the 120 Minutes Band, listening to Mary Wingate do the national anthem and just being absolutely transported by Shay Taylor and Friends, the gospel group that got us all going today. And I cannot thank a better twosome than the people you just saw up here.Because I honestly believe Jim Hunt is not only one of the best governors North Carolina has ever had, but one of the best governors ever in America in the last years. And what he did to really put North Carolina on a path to the future has stood the test of time. We’ve had a few glitches with others who don’t seem to understand what the ingredients are for building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. But Jim Hunt knows that.I look forward to continuing to work with him. And I was so delighted to have a chance, as I did, to have Alicia Wilkerson talk about her journey, how hard she has worked, raising her children, getting an education, making it possible for her to have a better future.I so greatly appreciate her mentioning the SCHIP program which has helped 8 million kids every year get health insurance. Now because we are in North Carolina and we have a lot of friends here I want to acknowledge some of them. Your Secretary of State Elaine Marshall.Senator Dan Blue, the Minority Leader of the North Carolina Senate. Representative Larry Hall, the Democratic leader of the North Carolina House of Representatives. Linda Coleman running for Lieutenant Governor. Judge Mike Morgan running against a Republican Supreme Court incumbent. And don’t forget than Dan Blue III is running for State Treasurer. Josh Stein, running for Attorney General. And let’s give a big round of applause to your next governor, Attorney General Roy Cooper! Your next AG commissioner Walter Smith and your next United States Senator, Debra Ross. We’re going to work hard in the this election to elect as many Democrats up and down the ticket so that North Carolina can get back on the path to the path to the future, get off this detour that you’ve been on.I have to start by saying if you notice anything different about me today, it could be that now I have double the “grandmother glow.” This past weekend, Chelsea and Marc had a little boy and we’re all totally over the moon about it.Obviously, our family will do everything we can to make sure little Charlotte and now little Aidan grow up with every possible opportunity. I know that’s what every parent and grandparent, aunt or uncle, godmother and godfather, people who care about the children in our lives, that’s exactly how we all feel. I believe with all my heart that you should not have to be the grandchild of a former president or secretary of state to have every opportunity available to you in this country.Every single child deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential and that has been the cause of my life. It’s rooted in the values I learned from my family and my faith. We’re all in this together. And we have a responsibility to lift each other up.  As we Methodists say: Do all the good you can to all the people you can in all the ways you can. And that is absolutely true for our children.  That’s why I got into public service in the first place. And it’s why I’m determined that we will win this election. I think it’s an understatement to say that Americans face a choice in November.  As I said yesterday in Ohio, Donald Trump offers no real solutions for the economic challenges we face—he just continues to spout reckless ideas that will run up our debt and cause another economic crash.   I’m here today to offer an alternative. I have a clear vision for the economy, and it’s this: We need to make sure our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.  Not just for the rich or the well-connected, not just for people living in some parts of the country, or people from certain backgrounds and not others—I mean everyone.  I have a plan to get us there: Five steps we can take together to drive growth that’s strong, fair, and lasting. Growth that reduces inequality, increases upward mobility; that reaches into every corner of our country.The measure of our success will be how much incomes rise for hardworking families. How many children are lifted out of poverty. How many Americans can find good jobs that support a middle class life and not only that, jobs that provide a sense of dignity and pride. That’s what it means to have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That’s the mission, and I’m asking all of you to join me in it. We have to overcome some big challenges. I will admit that.First, too many of our representatives in Washington are in the grips of a failed economic theory called trickle-down economics. I do not question their sincerity, but it has been proven wrong again and again.   But there are still people in Congress who insist on cutting taxes for the wealthy instead of investing in our future. They careen from one self-inflicted crisis to another—shutting down the government, threatening to default on our national debt, refusing to make the commonsense investments that used to have broad bipartisan support, like rebuilding our roads and our bridges, our tunnels, our highways and airports, or investing in better education from zero through high school and college.I like to look at evidence: I plead to that. I think evidence is important when making decisions that affect other people’s lives. If the evidence were there to support this ideology, I would have to acknowledge that, but we have seen the results. Twice now in the past 30 years a Republican president has caused an economic mess and a Democratic president has had to come in and clean it up. And yes, too many special interests and too many lobbyists have stood in the way of progress while protecting the perks of the privileged few.It’s not just Washington. Too many corporations have embraced policies that favor hedge funds and other big shareholders and top management at the expense of their workers, communities, and even their long-term value. They’re driven by Wall Street’s obsession with short-term share prices and quarterly earnings.  A recent survey of corporate executives found that more than half when asked would hold off on making a successful long-term investment—maybe in their workers, or plant equipment, or research—if it meant missing a target in the next earnings report.  So corporations stash cash overseas or they send it to top shareholders in the form of stock buybacks or dividends, instead of raising wages or investing in research and development.  This pressure, this short-term pressure, leads to perverse incentives and outrageous behavior. It is wrong to take taxpayer dollars with one hand and give out pink slips with the other hand. And no company should be moving their headquarters overseas, just to avoid paying their taxes here at home.In addition, there have been big changes in how American families live, learn, and work, but our policies haven’t kept up. There are so many examples of this.Over the past several decades, women have entered the workforce and boosted our economy, yet we are the only, the only developed country that doesn’t provide paid family leave of any kind. We’re asking families to rely on an old system of supports in a new economic reality. No wonder so many are struggling.The bottom line is that too many leaders in business and government have lost sight of our shared responsibility to each other and to our nation.They let Wall Street take big risks with unregulated financial activities, they skew our tax code toward the wealthy, they failed to enforce our trade rules, they undermined workers’ rights. They have forgotten that we are all in this together and we are at our best when we recognize that. Excessive inequality such as we have today reduces economic growth. Markets work best when all the stakeholders share in the benefits.The challenges we face are significant.It is not easy to change Washington, or how corporations behave. It takes more than stern words or a flashy slogan—it takes a plan. It takes experience and the ability to work with both parties to get results. That means we need a president who knows what we’re up against, has no illusions about what we need to do to move ahead, but can actually get it done. And that is what I am offering.Because there is good news. The good news is that everywhere I go, smart, determined men and women are working hard to reverse these trends.Mayors are pioneering innovative ways to work with the private sector to invest in their cities.  Entrepreneurs and small businesses are building and hiring in places that bigger companies have abandoned.  Unions are providing training programs that add value to the companies that employ their members. Union pension funds are already investing in infrastructure projects that have supported more than 100,000 jobs here in our country. So do not grow weary, there are great ideas out there. And we are going to be partners in a big, bold effort to increase economic growth and distribute it more fairly.  To build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. I believe the federal government should adopt five ambitious goals:First, let’s break through the dysfunction in Washington to make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.  Second, let’s make college debt-free for all. And transform the way we prepare Americans for the jobs of the future. Third, let’s rewrite the rules so more companies share profits with their employees, and fewer ship profits and jobs overseas.Finally, let’s make sure that Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich pay their fair share of taxes. And all of this depends upon putting our families first and matching our policies to how you actually live and work in the 21st century. Briefly about these four points: Let’s start with jobs.Every American willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays enough to support a family. And I know we can do this because I’ve seen it in the past.You know, I remember when I was growing up and America had come out from the upheaval of depression and world war. Our leaders worked together to invest in a new foundation for American power and prosperity.Highways to connect up our entire nation. College and housing for returning veterans and their families. Unprecedented scientific research. And it worked—we built the greatest middle class the world has ever known. Now, we have to get as ambitious again. There is nothing we can’t do. Let’s be just as ambitious to build our 21st century American economy to produce the same results for hard working Americans.In my first 100 days as president, I will work with both parties to pass a comprehensive plan to create the next generation of good jobs. Now the heart of my plan will be the biggest investment in American infrastructure in decades, including establishing an infrastructure bank that will bring private sector dollars off the sidelines and put them to work here.And I’ve talked with local leaders around America and I’ve seen the dire need for investment. In Tampa, for example, I saw how a smart, targeted highway investment near a major port can create thousands of good-paying jobs, support the local economy and unlock national commerce.We can create millions of good-paying jobs while preparing America to compete and win in the global economy.  So let’s set these big national goals. And I know how important it is to rebuild our roads, our bridges and our airports, but we have more work to do. Let’s build better. And let’s connect every household to broadband by the year 2020.Let’s build a cleaner, more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country. Let’s fix failing water systems like the one that poisoned children in Flint, Michigan. Let’s renovate our public schools so every child in every community has access to safe, high-tech classrooms, laboratories, and libraries.  Our 100 Days jobs package will also include transformational investments in key drivers of growth: Advance manufacturing, so we can “make it in America” and compete and win in the global economy. Making America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century, which will create millions of jobs and help protect our planet. Recommitting to scientific research, which can create new whole industries, just like we did in the ’90s, when we started mapping the human genome. And small businesses, which should be the engine for creating new jobs across America, they need to be free of red tape and they need to have access to credit. We need to slash unnecessary regulations making it easier to get startup capital from community banks and credit unions. If you have an idea for a small business, we want you to get started.Let’s free entrepreneurs to do what they do best—innovate and grow and hire and make sure that the new service and caregiving jobs being created today are jobs that pay well, too. And that does mean raising the national minimum wage.So many of these are so personal to us that they need to be respected and lifted up. And I know too that we’ve got work to do to stand with those who are fighting for raising the minimum wage. It’s not always how we think about this, but I can tell you another engine for growth and job creation would be comprehensive immigration reform.It will bring millions of workers into the formal economy so you don’t have an unlevel playing field, so that workers who are competing for those jobs don’t get undercut because employers go out and find undocumented workers to do those jobs for a lower wage. I really believe it’s not just the right thing to do, but it will be great.It will be smart for our economy. I want people to be able to compete. I don’t want to have that disadvantage that exists in too many places, where people are being are being priced out of the jobs they’ve always done.So we can work toward a full employment and full potential economy. That does mean we can’t ignore people that are still stuck on the sidelines, or working part-time when what they really want is a full-time job. Or those trapped in long-term joblessness, whether they’re veterans, workers with disabilities, people coming home from prison, or young people who tried to start their careers in the midst of the Great Recession. I particularly want young people to feel that they are going to get good jobs that will give them that ladder of opportunity that they deserve to have in America.That’s why I want to expand incentives like the New Markets Tax Credit, Empowerment Zones, and other ideas that bring business, government, and communities together to create good jobs in poor or remote areas. Places that have lost a factory or a mine where generations of families used to work. Anyone willing to work should get the help they need to qualify for and find that good job.That means breaking down the barriers of systemic racism and discrimination that hold back —those barriers, they hold back African Americans, Latinos, Asian and Native Americans, and women from fully participating in our economy. We need to reverse the long-term neglect that has dried up jobs and opportunity in communities of color, in poor communities. It’s not by accident that the unemployment rate now among black Americans is twice as high as among whites. Back in the ’90s, we were closing that gap, incomes were going up for everybody. I think we’re going to have to invest money to create jobs for young people because right now I’m worried that if young people don’t get that first job when they are young, learn about work, understand the obligations as well as the promise of work, it will be even more difficult to get them into the workforce later on. It is way past time for us to guarantee equal pay for women, which is still not the reality.So, you see it is not enough to have an affirmative agenda, we have to knock down those barriers. And by the way, as you’ve seen here in North Carolina discriminating against LGBT Americans is bad for business.And make no mistake, we will defend American jobs and American workers by saying “no” to bad trade deals and unfair trade practices, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which does not meet my high bar for creating good-paying jobs. “No” to assaults on the right to organize and bargain collectively.“No” to every attack on the dignity of working families.  We’re going to make this economy work for everyone, and it’s time we start building this from the ground up. For every home and every community all the way to Washington. Now, I know very well that if you don’t have the skills for the jobs of tomorrow, it’s going to be difficult. Education is still the pathway for greater opportunities for many Americans. Let’s start at the beginning with making quality, affordable child care and preschool available in every community in the next 10 years, so we get our littlest Americans off to the best start.  Jim Hunt was a pioneer in this. Why did he care so much about children zero to five, besides the fact that he cared about them? Because he knew there was a direct line to how the youngest children were treated, educated, and prepared for school, and what kind of jobs and economic competitiveness North Carolina would have. So we’re going to start by having families be their child’s first teachers, and we’re going to give them the support they need to do that. And when it comes to primary and secondary education I pledged to you we’re going to make sure all our kids have good teachers and good schools, no matter what ZIP code you live in.  You know, for many years, thanks to people and leaders like Jim Hunt, North Carolina was a leading state when it came to education. Now, unfortunately, thanks to your Governor McCrory and the legislature, the average teacher salary can barely support a family. It should not be a surprise that thousands have quit in recent years.  We should support our teachers, not scapegoat them.   And then let’s make sure every student has options after high school. Whether it’s a four-year degree, free community college, an apprenticeship, or other forms of higher education, we need to provide the skills and credentials that match the job openings of today and tomorrow. That’s why I’m proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to offer paid apprenticeships that lets you earn while you learn. And I will to support the union apprenticeships and training programs already out there. Not every good job requires a four-year college degree. We need to dignify skills training. So many young people have the talent and the will to succeed—they just need a helping hand.  That’s why I want us to come together to help our young people break free from the burden of student debt. I’m sure we all have stories. I’ve met so many who told me they can’t start a business. They can’t even move out of their parent’s basement because of all the student debt holding them back.Let’s set the goal to make debt-free college available to everyone. So future students won’t have to borrow a dime to pay for tuition at public college or university. And let’s liberate the millions of Americans who already have student debt by making it easier to refinance, just like a mortgage. Let’s make it easier to have debt forgiven by doing national service, let’s make it easier to repay what you owe as a portion of your income so you never have to pay more than you can afford.  I’ve set out a way to do this, and we’ll be talking more about it as we go forward in this campaign.My third goal is to rewrite the rules so more companies share profits with employees, and fewer ship profits and jobs overseas.I know there are a lot of businesses thriving here in North Carolina and across our country who see employees as assets to invest in, not costs to cut. They’re building companies, not stripping them. They’re creating good jobs, not eliminating them. But too many, too many businesses take the opposite view. I’m not asking corporations to be more charitable, although I think that is important. I’m asking corporations to realize that when more Americans prosper, they prosper too, right? When your paycheck grows, America grows. We are a 70 percent consumption economy. If we want higher growth, we have to raise incomes. So people have more disposable dollars to be able to spend, instead of holding back out of fear of what will happen. So let’s bring a long-term view back to board rooms and executive suites. Let’s restore the link between productivity growth and wage growth. As president, I will make it a national priority for more companies to share profits with employees. On top of, not instead of, good wages. Let’s recognize the people doing the work, putting in the hours, they’re the ones who should be sharing the rewards. We should continue to crack down on wage theft and make overtime count, so companies that pay well can’t be undercut by competitors paying poverty wages. I believe we should strengthen unions, which have formed the bedrock of a strong middle class. It should be easier to bargain collectively. That’s not only fair, it makes workers more productive, it strengthens our economy.And let’s close the loopholes that help companies ship jobs and profits overseas. Let’s make companies that outsource jobs to other countries pay back the tax breaks they received while they were here in America. And if corporations try to move their headquarters to a foreign country to skip out on their tax bills—let’s slap a new exit tax on them and then put that money to work in the communities left behind. And we should extend the rules that were passed in Dodd-Frank on Wall Street after the crisis and strengthen them—both for the big banks and the shadow banking system. And I will veto any reforms to repeal those rules and vigorously enforce the law, with accountability, so Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again.Fourth, let’s make sure Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich pay their fair share of taxes.When people say the game is rigged, the best evidence is the tax code. It’s riddled with scams, loopholes, and special breaks, like the carried-interest loophole that lets some hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse. That’s not only unfair, it’s bad economics, and we’re going to stop it.  I have been saying that for years. As president, if Congress won’t act, I will ask the Treasury Department to use its authority to close that loophole. And here’s another idea that I will be pushing: Let’s pass the so-called Buffett Rule so top executives can’t pay a lower rate than their secretaries. And let’s ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more—including a new tax on multimillionaires. That’s not only the right thing to do, it’s smart for our economy. Because these steps will help pay for the investments we need in jobs and education without increasing our national debt. In fact, every program I have proposed in this campaign, I tell you how I will pay for it. Donald Trump and I disagree on a lot of things, and one of them is simple math. Finally, here’s our fifth goal: Let’s put families first and make sure our policies match how you actually work and live in the 21st century.  Families look a lot different today than they did 30 years ago, and so do our jobs. The movement of women into the workforce has produced enormous economic growth over the past few decades. But with women now the sole or primary breadwinner in a growing number of families—there’s more urgency than ever to make it easier for Americans to be good workers, good parents, and good caregivers, all at the same time. The old model of work where you could expect to hold a steady job with good benefits for an entire career, is long gone. People in their 20s and 30s have come of age in an economy that’s totally different. And a lot of young parents are discovering just how tough that is on families. Many people now have wildly unpredictable schedules, or they cobble together part-time work, or they’ve tried to go independent.  Flexibility can be good, but you shouldn’t have to worry that your family could lose your health care or retirement savings just because you change jobs or start a small business.Why do you think every other—I have to ask—why do you think every other advanced country has paid family leave? Do you think they are just unrealistic, or do you think that they have figured out they can have a stabler economy, they can support families? And that’s what I want us to do. Working families need predictable scheduling, earned sick days and vacation days, quality affordable childcare and healthcare. These are not luxuries. They’re economic necessities.In today’s economy, benefits should be flexible, portable, and comprehensive for everyone. That means it’s time to expand Social Security as well. Especially, especially for older women who are widowed, or have taken time out of the workforce to care for a loved one, and who are suffering financially because of that. We need to look to a secure retirement for everyone, and to provide families relief from crushing costs and health care, housing, and prescription drugs. I looked at the numbers and in some states, two parents earning the minimum wage have to spend up to 35 percent of their income on child care.For a single parent, it could be 70 percent. So I will set a goal: Families shouldn’t have to pay more than 10 percent of their income for child care. And I will repeat today what I have said throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on the middle class I will give you tax relief to raise these burdens.Now, you know whenever I talk about these family issues, Donald Trump says I’m playing the “woman” card. Right? Well you know what I say, if fighting for child care and paid leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.Here’s what I want you to understand. It may be difficult to imagine all this getting done and Washington is so broken, I get that—but I really think that progress is possible or I would not be standing up here running to be president of the United States.I know Republicans and Democrats can work together, because I’ve done it. As you heard Alicia say, I helped create the Children’s Health Insurance Program when I was first lady. That happened with support with both parties. And it now it covers 8 million kids and when you go to get health care for your child, nobody says, “Are you a Republican or Democrat?” They say, “What does your child need?”I worked with Republicans many times when I was a senator from New York and as secretary of state, so I know we can get results that will make real differences in people’s lives.I know however it’s rare. There’s no question that we need to make Washington work much better than it does today. And that means in particular: getting unaccountable money out of our politics. One of the reasons this election is so important is because the Supreme Court stands in the balance. We need to overturn that terrible Supreme Court decision, Citizens United, and then go a lot further to reform our whole campaign finance system.This is about our democracy—but it’s also about our economy. Campaign finance reform and reducing the power of special interests is directly relevant to getting Washington working for the people again—making the right investments, putting your jobs and your economic security first. That’s why I’m so passionate about this issue, and I’m will fight hard to end the stranglehold that the wealthy and special interests have on so much of our government. So, let’s do this together. A historic investment in jobs. Debt-free college. Profit sharing. Making those at the top pay their fair share. Putting families first in our modern economy. And a democracy where working people’s voices are actually heard. That is what we are fighting for in this election.As I said during the primary I am a progressive who likes to get things done and we can do this.Just for a minute, compare what I am proposing to what we hear from Donald Trump. The self-proclaimed “King of Debt” has no real ideas for making college more affordable or addressing the student debt crisis.  He has no credible plan for rebuilding our infrastructure, apart from his wall. He has no real strategy for creating jobs, just a string of empty promises. Maybe we shouldn’t expect better from someone whose most famous words are, “You’re fired.”  Well, here’s what I want you to know: I do have a jobs program. And as president, I’m going to make sure you hear, “You’re hired.”Here’s the bottom line: Economists left, right, and center all agree Donald Trump will drive America back into recession. Just this week, one of Senator John McCain’s former economic advisors said Trump’s policies would wipe out, wipe out three-and-a-half million jobs. His tax cuts tilted toward the wealthy would add more than $30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years. That is just astonishing and it’s no wonder that the Economist Intelligence Unit, one of the leading firms that analyzes the top threats to the global economy, now ranks a Trump presidency No. 3, right behind problems in China and volatility in the commodities markets.Look, I know Donald Trump hates it when anyone points out how hollow his sales pitch really is. I guess my speech yesterday must have gotten under his skin because right away he lashed out on Twitter with outlandish lies and conspiracy theories, and he did the same in his speech today.  Now think about it. He’s going after me personally because he has no answers on the substance. In fact, he doubled down on being the King of Debt. So all he can do is try to distract us. That’s even why he’s attacking my faith, sigh. And of course attacking a philanthropic foundation that saves and improves lives around the world.  It’s no surprise he doesn’t understand these things. The Clinton Foundation helps poor people around the world get access to life-saving AIDS medicine. Donald Trump uses poor people around the world to produce his line of suits and ties.  Here in North Carolina, you know as well as anyone that our economy is already too unpredictable for working families. We can’t let Donald Trump bankrupt America the way he bankrupted his casinos. We need to write a new chapter in the American Dream—and it can’t be Chapter 11.Please, join me in this campaign, I’m offering a very different vision. We’re stronger together. We’re stronger when we grow together. We’re stronger when our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. I am convinced that if we work hard if we go into November with the confidence and optimism that should be the American birthright, we will not only win an election, we will chart the course to the future that we want and deserve. Thank you and God bless you.","Clinton Official"
"40",2016-06-14,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks condemning Donald Trump’s response to the Orlando shooting","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Hello! Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you all.It is so great to be back in Pittsburgh.  And it is especially great to be here with the men and women of the IBEW. I want to thank Mike Dunleavy and IBEW Local 5 for welcoming us to your house. We are happy to be here. And, I want to thank my longtime friend, colleague, advocate, Leo Gerard, who has been a champion, not just for steelworkers, but for working people—fairness, the kind of economy that lifts everybody up, for as long as I’ve known him.  I am so grateful to have the support of the steelworkers and IBEW. It means a lot to me because we want to put you all to work. We’re going to have a lot of work to do in our country and nobody can do it better.I want to recognize your County Executive, Rich Fitzgerald, and thank him for being such a great supporter, but, more than that, leading this county along with Mayor Bill Peduto, who has done such a great job to continue the renaissance of Pittsburgh. I want to join Leo in acknowledging your great Congressman Mike Doyle and your great Senator Bob Casey. There’s another mayor here, Mayor John Fetterman. John is here. John is hard to miss, so he’s here somewhere! I saw him somewhere earlier. I want to thank also City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak, and I want to thank Josh Shapiro, your candidate for Attorney General, and a Montgomery County Commissioner, Reverend James Edward Brown, and, all of you for being with us today.I always love coming to Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania, and it’s especially great to be here after the Penguins clinched the Stanley Cup again! It’s great, quite a record now. They’ve got some ways to go before they match the Steelers in terms of winning it all but they’re on their way. The County Executive and I were talking, and he said something that really struck me. The Penguins did this the old fashion way: teamwork, hard work, and resilience. And that’s what we’re going to do in this election. That’s what we’re going to do in our country. When I planned this trip, I intended to give a different talk today.  About how we make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top, how do we reduce the economic inequality that’s threatening not just our economy, but our democracy.  How we rebuild our infrastructure, stand with our steelworkers against illegal dumping by China. And I wanted to talk too about how unions like yours, IBEW, and the steelworkers, and so many others, helped build the greatest middle class in the world. If anybody has a chair you can use it because don’t worry, the folks behind you have sat down and everybody is seated. That’s great.You see, I draw from our history that labor is central to whatever we want to achieve. I’m going to be a strong partner and advocate for the American labor movement, for working people, for your rights and your opportunities to make the very best possible living in the greatest country on earth. These are the issues that are in my heart. I will be talking about them in the weeks ahead. They’re really at the center of my campaign.But today, there are different things on my mind—and probably on yours, too, as Leo said.We are all still reeling from what happened on Sunday in Orlando. Another terrorist attack—not overseas, but here at home.  So many Americans killed and wounded. A hate crime at an LGBT nightclub, right in the middle of Pride Month.  The deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States. The losses stretch all the way to Pennsylvania.  Two of the victims were from this state. Akyra Murray, a high school basketball star from Philadelphia, was killed; she was just 18 years old.  And her friend Patience Carter, also from Philadelphia, was shot.  It’s a poignant reminder that even in a country as big as ours, we are all connected.  And our hearts are with Patience and Akyra’s families, and all the families who are grieving now.Since Sunday, we’ve been trying to make sense of what happened, and what we can do together to prevent future attacks.Yesterday in Cleveland, I once again laid out my plan for defeating ISIS and the broader radical jihadist movement, around the world and online and for combating radicalization here at home, including a special focus on detecting and preventing so-called ‘lone wolf’ attacks like we saw in Orlando and San Bernardino.  These attacks are carried out by individuals who may or may not have any direct contact with an organization like ISIS, but are inspired, primarily over the internet, by its twisted ideology.I reemphasized the importance of working with Muslim communities here at home, who are often the most likely to recognize radicalization before it’s too late. After the attacks in Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, I met with homeland security officials and Muslim community leaders in Minneapolis and Los Angeles, to hear their ideas for building stronger partnerships.  We need to lift up voices of moderation and tolerance. I also said something I’ve been saying from the very beginning of this campaign: I believe we Americans are capable of both protecting our Second Amendment rights while making sure guns don’t fall into the wrong hands.  The terrorist in Orlando was the definition of ‘the wrong hands.’  And weapons of war have no place in our streets. So the questions being debated this week about how we deal with the threat of terrorism are some of the most charged and important issues we face.  And there are bound to be differences of opinion. In a country as diverse and complex as ours, I think that’s a given.But I believe that despite those differences, on a deeper level, we are all on the same team. We may not see eye to eye on everything, but we are all Americans. And there is so much more that unites us than divides us. I have said many times, I think it’s appropriate for us, not to consider ourselves on the Republican team or the Democratic team, on the red team or the blue team, but to be on the American team. And after a terrible event, like Orlando, that’s clearer than ever. That’s what we’re seeing in Orlando and across America—people of different faiths, backgrounds, sexual orientations, and gender identities coming together to say with one voice, we won’t let hate defeat us. If we can count on that kind of unity and solidarity from each other – if even the families of the Orlando victims are speaking out right now against hate and division – we should certainly expect that from our leaders. And I am sorry to say that is not what we are hearing from Donald Trump. Donald Trump wants to be our next Commander in Chief.  I think we all know that is a job that demands a calm, collected, and dignified response to these kinds of events. Instead, yesterday morning, just one day after the massacre, he went on TV and suggested that President Obama is on the side of the terrorists. Just think about that for a second. Even in a time of divided politics, this is beyond anything that should be said by someone running for President of the United States. And I have to ask – will responsible Republican leaders stand up to their presumptive nominee?  Or will they stand by his accusation about our President? I am sure they would rather avoid that question altogether. But history will remember what we do in this moment. What Donald Trump is saying is shameful. It is disrespectful to the people who were killed and wounded, and their families. And it is yet more evidence that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be Commander in Chief. Of course, he is a leader of the birther movement, which spread the lie that President Obama wasn’t born in the United States.  I guess he had to be reminded Hawaii is part of the United States. This is the man who claimed a distinguished federal judge born and raised in Indiana can’t do his job because of his – quote –‘Mexican heritage.’ I guess he has to be reminded Indiana is in the United States. So maybe we shouldn’t be surprised. But it was one thing when he was a reality TV personality.  You know, raising his arms and yelling, you’re fired. It is another thing altogether when he’s the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee for president. Americans don’t need conspiracy theories and pathological self-congratulations. We need leadership, common sense and concrete plans. Because we are facing a brutal enemy. In the Middle East, ISIS is attempting a genocide of religious and ethnic minorities. They’re slaughtering Muslims who refuse to accept their medieval ways. They are beheading civilians, including executing LGBT people; murdering Americans and Europeans; enslaving, torturing, and raping women and girls.The barbarity we face from radical jihadists is profound. So I would like to have a worthy debate on the best way to keep our country safe. That’s what Americans deserve. I read every word of Donald Trump’s speech yesterday. And I sifted through all the bizarre rants and the outright lies. What I found, once you cut through the nonsense, is that his plan comes down to two things. First, he is fixated on the words ‘radical Islam.’ I must say, I find this strange. Is Donald Trump suggesting that there are magic words that, once uttered, will stop terrorists from coming after us? Trump, as usual, is obsessed with name-calling. From my perspective, it matters what we do, not just what we say. In the end, it didn’t matter what we called bin Laden – it mattered that we got bin Laden.I have clearly said that we face terrorist enemies who use a perverted version of Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. We have to stop them, and we will. So if Donald suggests I won’t call this threat what it is, he hasn’t been listening.But I will not demonize and declare war on an entire religion.Now that we’re past the semantic debate, Donald is going to have to come up with something better.He’s got one other idea. He wants to ban all Muslims from entering our country. And now he wants to go even further, and suspend all immigration from large parts of the world.I’ve talked before about how this approach is un-American.  It goes against everything we stand for as a country founded on religious freedom. But it is also dangerous. First, we rely on partners in Muslim countries to fight terrorists; this would make it harder. Second, we need to build trust in Muslim communities here at home to counter radicalization; and this would make it harder.  Third, Trump’s words will be, in fact they already are, a recruiting tool for ISIS to help increase its ranks of people willing to do what we saw in Orlando. And fourth, he’s turning Americans against Americans, which is exactly what ISIS wants.Leaders who’ve actually fought terrorists know this. General Petraeus said recently that ‘demonizing a religious faith and its adherents’ will come at a great cost, not just to our values but to our men and women in uniform and our national security. Commissioner Bill Bratton of the New York Police Department said this kind of talk makes his job harder. He has Muslims in his police force, he has Muslims in the community, he needs everybody working together against any potential threat. But Donald won’t listen to any of this. Not experts like General Petraeus or Commissioner Bratton, because he says he knows more about ISIS than the generals do. It’s almost hard to think of what to say about that claim. But in this instance, Donald’s words are especially nonsensical. Because the terrorist who carried out this attack wasn’t born in Afghanistan, as Donald Trump said yesterday. He was born in Queens – just like Donald was himself. So Muslim bans and immigration reforms would not have stopped him. They would not have saved a single life in Orlando. Those are the only two ideas Donald Trump put forward yesterday for how to fight ISIS.Beyond that, he said a lot of false things, including about me. He said I’ll abolish the Second Amendment. Well, that’s wrong. He said I’ll let a flood of refugees into our country without any screening. That’s also wrong.These are demonstrably lies. But he feels compelled to tell them – because he has to distract us from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.Much of the rest of his speech was spent denigrating not just the President, but the efforts of all the brave American service members, law enforcement agents, intelligence officers, diplomats and others who have worked so hard to keep our country safe. Donald says our military is a disaster and the world is laughing at us. Wrong again. Since 9/11, America has done a great deal at home and abroad to stop terrorists. Thousands of Americans have fought and died.  We have worked intensively with our allies, engaged in fierce and vital debates here at home about how far our government should go in monitoring threats.  We have vastly increased security measures at airports, train stations, power plants and many other places. And the American people, we have all become more vigilant, even while we have carried on living our lives as normally as possible. It has been a long and difficult effort. We’ve had successes, and we’ve also had failures. But one thing’s for sure: the fight against terrorism has never been simple. We need a Commander-in-Chief who is up to these challenges – who can grapple with them in all their complexity – someone with real plans and real solutions that actually address the problems we face. And we need someone with the temperament and experience to make those hard choices in the Situation Room – not a loose cannon who could easily lead us into war. One more thing. Donald Trump has been very clear about what he won’t do. He won’t stand up to the gun lobby. The terrorist who killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in Orlando did it with two guns: a handgun and a Sig Sauer MCX rifle. If you don’t know what that is, I urge you to Google it. See it for yourself.This man had been investigated by the FBI for months. But we couldn’t stop him from buying a powerful weapon that he used to slaughter Americans in large numbers. Let’s get this straight. We have reached the point where people can’t board planes with full bottles of shampoo – but people being watched by the FBI for suspected terrorist links can buy a gun with no questions asked. That is absurd. It just seems like western Pennsylvania common sense, if you’re too dangerous to get on a plane, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun. Enough is enough. Now is time for seriousness and resolve. We need to go after ISIS overseas, we need to protect Americans here at home, counter their poisonous ideologies, support our first responders, take a hard look at our gun laws and we need to stand with the LGBT community and peaceful Muslim Americans, today and always.In the days and weeks ahead, I will have more to say about how we will work together to keep our country and our citizens safe and take the fight to the terrorists.  None of this will be easy. And none of it will be helped by anything that Donald Trump has to offer. This is a time to set aside fear and division, and reach for unity. America is strongest when we all feel like we have a stake in our country. When we all have real chance to live up to our God-given potential, and we want others here to have that chance, too.We’ve always been a country of ‘we,’ not ‘me.’ And we’ve always been stronger together. We are stronger when people can participate in our democracy, share in the rewards of our economy, and contribute to our communities.When we bridge our divides and lift each other up, instead of tearing each other down. Here in Pennsylvania and across America, I have listened to so many people tell me about the problems that keep you and your families up at night. Despite all the progress we’ve made, there’s not yet enough growth, which creates good jobs and raises incomes. There’s not yet enough economic fairness, so that everyone who works hard can share in the rewards.  We need both – a ‘growth and fairness’ economy. Where profits and paychecks rise together. So many people have talked to me about how the bonds that hold us together as one national community are strained – by too much inequality, too little upward mobility, social and political divisions that have diminished our trust in each other and our confidence in our shared future. As your president, I will work every day to break down all the barriers holding you back and keeping us apart.  And I will be on your side. I’ll have the back of every steelworker getting knocked around by unfair competition. Of every working mom trying to raise her kids on minimum wage or unequal pay. Of every union member struggling to keep going in the face of concerted attacks on workers’ rights – because ‘right to work’ is wrong for workers, and we need to stand strong with unions.Together, I want us to forge a new sense of connection and a shared responsibility to each other and our nation. I know that’s possible, because I have seen it throughout our history – including just this week. Some of you may have noticed a letter that went viral on the internet over the past few days. The letter is from George H.W. Bush’s presidential library. I hadn’t read it in a long time – until yesterday.  And it moved me to tears, just like it did all those years ago. It’s the letter that President Bush left in the Oval Office for my husband, back in January of 1993. They had just fought a fierce campaign. Bill won, President Bush lost. In a democracy, that’s how it goes. But when Bill walked into that office for the very first time as President, that note was waiting for him. It had some good advice about staying focused on what mattered, despite the critics. It wished him happiness. And it concluded with these words:‘You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well.  Your success is now our country’s success. And I am rooting hard for you. George.’ That’s the America we love. That is what we cherish and expect. So let us come together, we can disagree without being disagreeable, we can root for each other’s success. Where our President is everyone’s President, and our future belongs to us all. Let’s make this once again the big-hearted, fair-minded country we all know and love. Thank you all very much.","Clinton Official"
"41",2016-06-14,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Planned Parenthood Action Fund","Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at Planned Parenthood Action Fund:Thank you. Hello. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you all. I have to say, pink never looked so good.I want to thank my friend, and your courageous leader, Cecile Richards. Cecile really is the definition of grace under pressure. She has proven that time and time again over the course of her career, particularly over the last few years. She really is like another great American, her mother, Ann Richards, who was a friend of mine, and I just wish Ann were here to see this election. She’d have Donald Trump tweeting double time.We reached a milestone together this week.  Thanks to you, and people all over our country, for the first time, a woman will be a major party’s nominee for President of the United States.  And yesterday, I had the great honor of being endorsed by President Obama and Vice President Biden.  And by Senator Elizabeth Warren.So it’s been a big week.  And there’s nowhere I’d rather end it than right here, with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.I’m grateful to the entire Planned Parenthood family.  You made this campaign your own.  Whether you knocked on doors in Iowa or rallied in California, this victory belongs to all of you.It belongs to the one thousand young activists who came together in Pittsburgh last month to get organized.  It belongs to the staff, the donors, and to the providers. Providers like Dr. Amna Dermish in Texas, who called out Donald Trump when he said women should be punished for having abortions.  And the open letter she wrote defending her patients’ right to make their own health decisions should be required reading for every politician in America.I am deeply conscious of the reality that this victory belongs to generations of brave women and men who fought for the radical idea that women should determine our own lives and futures.And it belongs to the women and men who continue to fight for that idea today, even in the face of threats and violence.  When a man who never should have had a gun killed three people at Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs, leaders in this room voted unanimously to keep health centers across America open the next day.The CEO, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountains made a promise to patients in Colorado and beyond when she said: ‘Our doors – and our hearts – stay open.’  That is really what Planned Parenthood is all about.  So today, I want to say something you don’t hear often enough: thank you.Thank you for being there for women, no matter their race, sexual orientation, or immigration status.Thank you for being there for Natarsha McQueen in Brooklyn, who told me how Planned Parenthood caught her breast cancer when she was just 33 years old, and saved her life.Thank you for being there for college students getting STD testing.  The young people who have the tough questions that they’re afraid to ask their parents.  The sexual assault survivors who turn to Planned Parenthood for compassionate care.  The transgender teens who come for an appointment and find the first place where they can truly be themselves.Thank you for being there for your communities – whether that means taking on hostile politicians in Louisiana or handing out clean drinking water in Flint, Michigan.And thank you for being there for every woman in every state who has to miss work; drive hundreds of miles sometimes; endure cruel, medically unnecessary waiting periods; walk past angry protesters to exercise her constitutional right to safe and legal abortion.  I’ve been proud to stand with Planned Parenthood for a long time. And as president, I will always have your back.Because I know for a century, Planned Parenthood has worked to make sure that the women, men, young people who count on you can lead their best lives – healthy, safe and free to follow their dreams.Just think when Planned Parenthood was founded, women couldn’t vote or serve on juries in most states.  It was illegal even to provide information about birth control, let alone prescribe it.But people marched and organized.  They protested unjust laws and, in some cases, even went to prison.  And slowly but surely, America changed for the better.  51 years ago this week, thanks to a Planned Parenthood employee named Estelle Griswold, the Supreme Court legalized birth control for married couples across America. When I used to teach law, and I would point to this case, a look of total bewilderment would come across my students’ faces. And not long after that, Roe v. Wade guaranteed the right to safe, legal abortion.So young women were no longer dying in emergency rooms and back alleys from botched, illegal abortions.  And this is a fact that is not often heard, but I hope you will repeat it: America’s maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically.  And it turns out, being able to plan their families not only saved women’s lives, it also transformed them – because it meant that women were able to get educations, build careers, enter new fields, and rise as far as their talent and hard work would take them – all the opportunities that follow when women are able to stay healthy and choose whether and when to become mothers.And you know so well, today, the percentage of women who finish college is six times what it was before birth control was legal.  Women represent half of all college graduates in America and nearly half our labor force.  And our whole economy, then, is better off.  The movement of women into the workforce, the paid workforce, over the past 40 years was responsible for more than three and a half trillion dollars in growth in our economy.  And here’s another fact that doesn’t get much attention: unintended pregnancy, teen pregnancy, and abortion rates are at all time record lows.  That reality and studies confirm what Planned Parenthood knew all along: Accurate sex education and effective, affordable contraception work.And, it wasn’t so long ago, Republicans and Democrats could actually stand together on these issues.  Back in the ‘90s, when I helped create the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, I worked with Republicans to get it done.Now things feel quite a bit different now, don’t they?Instead of working to continue the progress we’ve made, Republicans, led now by Donald Trump, are working to reverse it.When Donald Trump says, ‘Let’s make America great again,’ that is code for ‘let’s take America backward.’  Back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some, not all.  Back to the days when abortion was illegal, women had far fewer options, and life for too many women and girls was limited.Well, Donald, those days are over.We are not going to let Donald Trump or anyone else turn back the clock.And that means we’ve got to get to work.  Because as you know better than anyone, right now, across the country, rights that women should be able to take for granted are under attack.Any day now, the Supreme Court will rule on the Texas law that imposes burdensome and medically unnecessary requirements on abortion providers.  If these restrictions are allowed to stand, 5.4 million women of reproductive age will be left with about 10 health centers that provide abortion – in a state the size of France.  It is the biggest challenge to Roe v. Wade in a generation.It’s also yet another reminder of what’s at stake on the Supreme Court.  President Obama has done his job, and nominated Merrick Garland to be the ninth justice.  It’s time for Senate Republicans to do their job. The Senate should give Judge Garland the hearing he deserves.Now, meanwhile, in just the first three months of 2016, states across the country introduced more than 400 restrictions on abortion. 11 states have defunded Planned Parenthood in the last year, cutting some women off from their only health care provider.  And of course, on a national level, Republicans in Congress have been willing to shut down the entire federal government over Planned Parenthood funding.  Have you ever noticed that the same politicians who are against sex education, birth control, and safe and legal abortion, are also against policies that would make it easier to raise a child – like paid family leave?They are for limited government everywhere except when it comes to interfering with women’s choices and rights.Well I’m here today to tell you we need to be just as determined as they are.  We need to defend Planned Parenthood against partisan attacks.  If right-wing politicians actually cared as much about protecting women’s health as they say they do, they’d join me in calling for more federal funding for Planned Parenthood.We also need to fight back against the erosion of reproductive rights at the federal, state, and local levels, and ensure that patients and staff can safely walk into health centers without harassment or violence.We need to, we need to stand up for access to affordable contraception, without interference from politicians or employers.  And let’s invest in long-acting reversible contraceptives, so every woman can choose the method that is best for her.  Let’s strengthen and improve the Affordable Care Act, which covers 20 million Americans and saves women millions of dollars through no-copay preventive care.Let’s take action to stop the spread of the Zika virus, which threatens the health of children and pregnant women.Let’s repeal laws like the Hyde Amendment that make it nearly impossible, make it nearly impossible for low-income women, disproportionately women of color, to exercise their full reproductive rights.  And, it is worth saying again: defending women’s health means defending access to abortion – not just in theory, but in reality.  We know that restricting access doesn’t make women less likely to end a pregnancy.  It just makes abortion less safe.  And that then threatens women’s lives.  For too long, issues like these have been dismissed by many as ‘women’s issues’ – as though that somehow makes them less worthy, secondary.Well, yes, these are women’s issues.  They’re also family issues.  They’re economic issues.  They’re justice issues. They’re fundamental to our country and our future.Beyond these specific issues, we need to keep working to support women and families in other ways – by getting incomes rising, including the minimum wage, which disproportionately affects women; we need to finally guarantee equal pay for women’s work; we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that keeps families together; and we need to break down all the barriers of discrimination and systemic racism that hold too many Americans back.  We need to come together to stop the epidemic of gun violence that is stalking our country.  No parent should live in fear that their child will be hurt or killed by gun violence.  33,000 Americans are killed every year. I’ve met so many mothers on this campaign who have lost their own children.  We owe it to them to protect our kids no matter what ZIP code they live in. And that is going to require standing up to the gun lobby and making this a voting issue.All the issues we’re talking about today are connected.  They intersect.  And that’s why I’m grateful to the reproductive justice leaders in this room and across America.  Because you know that all those issues go straight to that fundamental question: whether we believe women and families of all races and backgrounds and income levels deserve an equal shot in life.Now that’s what I believe and you won’t be surprised to hear – Donald Trump believes something very different.He actually thinks guaranteeing paid family leave would leave America less competitive.  He says if women want equal pay, we should just – and this is a quote – ‘do as good a job’ as men – as if we weren’t already.  He wants to appoint justices who want to overturn Roe V. Wade. He of course wants to defund Planned Parenthood. And he wants to go after so many of the fundamental rights we have, including safe and legal abortions. And he actually said, ‘women should be punished for having abortions.’ Now, once he said that there was an outcry, as there should have been, and he tried to walk back his comments. He’s doing that a lot lately.But anyone who would so casually agree to the idea of punishing women – like it was nothing to him, the most obvious thing in the world – that is someone who doesn’t hold women in high regard.  Because if he did, he’d trust women to make the right decisions for ourselves.But don’t worry.  Donald assures us that, as President, he’ll be – and I quote again – ‘the best for women.’Anyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood, and wipe out safe, legal abortion has no idea what’s best for women.  And after all this is a man who has called women ‘pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ and ‘disgusting animals.’  Kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights?  When he says pregnant women are an ‘inconvenience’ to their employer, what does that say about how he values women – our work, our contributions?  We’re in the middle of a concerted, persistent assault on women’s health across our country. And we have to ask ourselves and ask everyone we come in contact with: Do we want to put our health, our lives, our futures in Donald Trump’s hands?Now, these questions aren’t hypothetical.  Every woman – and everyone who cares about women – will answer them when they vote in November.  When I talk like this, Donald Trump likes to say I’m playing the ‘woman card.’  And I like to say, if fighting for equal pay, Planned Parenthood, and the ability to make our own health decisions is playing the woman card, then deal me in.Now my friends, I come to this issue, of course as a woman, a mother, and a grandmother now.  But I also come to it as a former First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State.  And in those roles, in those roles, I traveled to parts of the world where girls are married off as soon as they are old enough to bear children.  Places where the denial of family planning consigns women to lives of hardship.I visited countries where governments have strictly regulated women’s reproduction – either forcing women to have abortions or forcing women to get pregnant and give birth.Everything I have seen has convinced me that life is freer, fairer, healthier, safer, and far more humane when women are empowered to make their own reproductive health decisions.And everything I’ve heard from Donald Trump, often seems to echo other leaders who have a very different view of women.  The late, great Maya Angelou said: ‘When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.’Donald Trump has shown us who he is.  And we sure should believe him.It’s not just on reproductive rights.  Donald Trump would take us in the wrong direction on so many issues we care about – economic justice, workers’ rights, civil rights, human rights, the environment—all of that is on the line in this election.When Donald Trump says a distinguished judge born in Indiana can’t do his job because of his Mexican heritage, or mocks a reporter with disabilities, or denigrates Muslims and immigrants, it goes against everything we stand for.  He does not see all Americans as Americans.So this election isn’t about the same old fights between Democrats and Republicans.  They’ll be there, don’t worry. But this election is profoundly different.  It’s about who we are as a nation.  It’s about millions of Americans coming together to say: We are better than this.  So here’s my promise to you today: I will be your partner in this election and over the long haul.  Together, we are taking on the attacks and together we’ll come out stronger – just like Planned Parenthood has, time and again.    And together we’re going to unify our country, stop Donald Trump, and fight for an America where we lift each other up, instead of tearing each other down.We’re not just going to break that highest and hardest glass ceiling.  We’re going to break down all the barriers that hold women and families back.We’re stronger when every family in every community knows they’re not on their own.  We are stronger together and we are going to make history again in November.Thank you all so, so much.","Clinton Official"
"45",2016-06-02,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks in San Diego, California","Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you San Diego for that warm, warm welcome and thanks to Ellen for those moving words, her introduction, and for reminding us it's not only our men and women in uniform that serve our country, it's their families, their spouses, their children, and we are grateful to each and every one of them. I want to recognize and thank Congressman Scott Peters for being here, thank you very much.And all of the other electeds and service members, active duty and retired National Guard and Reservists, veterans, military spouses, family members, all who are with us today.On Monday, we observed Memorial Day – a day that means a great deal to San Diego, home of so many active-duty and former military and their families. We honor the sacrifice of those who died for our country in many ways – by living our values, by making this a stronger and fairer nation, and by carrying out a smart and principled foreign policy.That's what I want to speak about today – the challenges we face in protecting our country, and the choice at stake in this election.It's a choice between a fearful America that's less secure and less engaged with the world, and a strong, confident America that leads to keep our country safe and our economy growing.As Secretary of State, Senator and First Lady, I had the honor of representing America abroad and helping shape our foreign policy at home. As a candidate for President, there's nothing I take more seriously than our national security. I've offered clear strategies for how to defeat ISIS, strengthen our alliances, and make sure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. And I'm going to keep America's security at the heart of my campaign.Because as you know so well, Americans aren't just electing a President in November. We're choosing our next commander-in-chief – the person we count on to decide questions of war and peace, life and death.And like many across our country and around the world, I believe the person the Republicans have nominated for President cannot do the job.Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different – they are dangerously incoherent. They're not even really ideas – just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.He is not just unprepared – he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes – because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.We cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump's hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America.This is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Saudi Arabia.This is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO – the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home.He believes we can treat the U.S. economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008.He has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists – even though those are war crimes.He says he doesn't have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has – quote – 'a very good brain.'He also said, 'I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.' You know what? I don't believe him.He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren't heroes.He praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends – including the British prime minister, the mayor of London, the German chancellor, the president of Mexico and the Pope.He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia.And to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are – and I quote – a 'third-world country.' And he's been saying things like that for decades.Those are the words my friends of someone who doesn't understand America or the world.And they're the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction. Because if you really believe America is weak – with our military, our values, our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching – then you don't know America.And you certainly don't deserve to lead it.That's why – even if I weren't in this race – I'd be doing everything I could to make sure Donald Trump never becomes President – because I believe he will take our country down a truly dangerous path.Unlike him, I have some experience with the tough calls and the hard work of statecraft. I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen, brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, negotiated the reduction of nuclear weapons with Russia, twisted arms to bring the world together in global sanctions against Iran, and stood up for the rights of women, religious minorities and LGBT people around the world.And I have, I have sat in the Situation Room and advised the President on some of the toughest choices he faced.So I'm not new to this work. And I'm proud to run on my record, because I think the choice before the American people in this election is clear.I believe in strong alliances; clarity in dealing with our rivals; and a rock-solid commitment to the values that have always made America great. And I believe with all my heart that America is an exceptional country – that we're still, in Lincoln's words, the last, best hope of earth. We are not a country that cowers behind walls. We lead with purpose, and we prevail.And if America doesn't lead, we leave a vacuum – and that will either cause chaos, or other countries will rush in to fill the void. Then they'll be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety – and trust me, the choices they make will not be to our benefit.That is not an outcome we can live with.As I see it, there are some important things our next President must do to secure American leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead. These are all areas in which Donald Trump and I profoundly disagree. And they are all critical to our future.First, we need to be strong at home.That means investing in our infrastructure, education and innovation – the fundamentals of a strong economy. We need to reduce income inequality, because our country can't lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families. And we need to break down the barriers that hold Americans back, including barriers of bigotry and discrimination.Compare that with what Trump wants to do. His economic plans would add more than $30 trillion – that's trillion with a 'T' – $30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years. He has no ideas on education. No ideas on innovation. He has a lot of ideas about who to blame, but no clue about what to do.None of what Donald Trump is offering will make America stronger at home. And that would make us weaker in the world.Second, we need to stick with our allies.America's network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional. And our allies deliver for us every day.Our armed forces fight terrorists together; our diplomats work side by side. Allies provide staging areas for our military, so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world. And they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats.Take the threat posed by North Korea – perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon to the United States.When I was Secretary of State, we worked closely with our allies Japan and South Korea to respond to this threat, including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead, should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us. The technology is ours. Key parts of it are located on Japanese ships. All three countries contributed to it. And this month, all three of our militaries will run a joint drill to test it.That's the power of allies.And it's the legacy of American troops who fought and died to secure those bonds, because they knew we were safer with friends and partners.Now Moscow and Beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the world, because they have nothing to match them. They'd love for us to elect a President who would jeopardize that source of strength. If Donald gets his way, they'll be celebrating in the Kremlin. We cannot let that happen.That's why it is no small thing when he talks about leaving NATO, or says he'll stay neutral on Israel's security.It's no small thing when he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers. We're lucky to have two friendly neighbors on our land borders. Why would he want to make one of them an enemy?And it's no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons, and said this about a war between Japan and North Korea – and I quote – 'If they do, they do. Good luck, enjoy yourself, folks.' I wonder if he even realizes he's talking about nuclear war.Yes, our friends need to contribute their fair share. I made that point long before Donald Trump came onto the scene – and a number of them have increased their defense spending. The real debate here is whether we keep these alliances strong or cut them off. What he says would weaken our country.Third, we need to embrace all the tools of American power, especially diplomacy and development, to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten us at home.Diplomacy is often the only way to avoid a conflict that could end up exacting a much greater cost. It takes patience, persistence and an eye on the long game – but it's worth it.Take the nuclear agreement with Iran. When President Obama took office, Iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb. Some called for military action. But that could have ignited a broader war that could have mired our troops in another Middle Eastern conflict.President Obama chose a different path. And I got to work leading the effort to impose crippling global sanctions. We brought Iran to the table. We began talks. And eventually, we reached an agreement that should block every path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.Now we must enforce that deal vigorously. And as I've said many times before, our approach must be 'distrust and verify.' The world must understand that the United States will act decisively if necessary, including with military action, to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. In particular, Israel's security is non-negotiable. They're our closest ally in the region, and we have a moral obligation to defend them.But there is no question that the world and the United States, we are safer now than we were before this agreement. And we accomplished it without firing a single shot, dropping a single bomb or putting a single American soldier in harm's way.Donald Trump says we shouldn't have done the deal. We should have walked away. But that would have meant no more global sanctions, and Iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us. So then what? War? Telling the world, good luck, you deal with Iran?Of course Trump doesn't have answers to those questions. Donald Trump doesn't know the first thing about Iran or its nuclear program. Ask him. It'll become very clear, very quickly.There's no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal.But it doesn't work like that in world affairs. Just like being interviewed on the same episode of ""60 Minutes"" as Putin was, is not the same thing as actually dealing with Putin.So the stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels. We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table – bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets – I'm willing to bet he's writing a few right now.But those tools won't do the trick. Rather than solving global crises, he would create new ones.He has no sense of what it takes to deal with multiple countries with competing interests and reaching a solution that everyone can get behind. In fact, he is downright contemptuous of that work. And that means he's much more likely to end up leading us into conflict.Fourth, we need to be firm but wise with our rivals.Countries like Russia and China often work against us. Beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets. That hurts American workers. Moscow has taken aggressive military action in Ukraine, right on NATO's doorstep. Now I've gone toe-to-toe with Russia and China, and many other different leaders around the world. So I know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must, and find common ground when we can.That's how I could work with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and with China to increase pressure on North Korea. It's how our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change, which Trump now wants to rip up.The key was never forgetting who we were dealing with – not friends or allies, but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements.Donald doesn't see the complexity. He wants to start a trade war with China. And I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements – I do too. But a trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful. Combine that with his comments about defaulting on our debt, and it's not hard to see how a Trump presidency could lead to a global economic crisis.And I have to say, I don't understand Donald's bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America. He praised China for the Tiananmen Square massacre; he said it showed strength. He said, 'You've got to give Kim Jong Un credit' for taking over North Korea – something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat, including his own uncle, which Donald described gleefully, like he was recapping an action movie. And he said if he were grading Vladimir Putin as a leader, he'd give him an 'A.'Now, I'll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America's real friends are. Because it matters. If you don't know exactly who you're dealing with, men like Putin will eat your lunch.Fifth, we need a real plan for confronting terrorists.As we saw six months ago in San Bernardino, the threat is real and urgent. Over the past year, I've laid out my plans for defeating ISIS.We need to take out their strongholds in Iraq and Syria by intensifying the air campaign and stepping up our support for Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground. We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syria's civil war and close Iraq's sectarian divide, because those conflicts are keeping ISIS alive. We need to lash up with our allies, and ensure our intelligence services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that supplies money, arms, propaganda and fighters to the terrorists. We need to win the battle in cyberspace.And of course we need to strengthen our defenses here at home.That – in a nutshell – is my plan for defeating ISIS.What's Trump's? Well he won't say. He is literally keeping it a secret. The secret, of course, is he has no idea what he'd do to stop ISIS.Just look at the few things he's actually said on the subject.He's actually said – and I quote –'maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.' Oh, okay – let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the Middle East.Then he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS.He also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS, which would mean mass civilian casualties.It's clear he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. So we can't be certain which of these things he would do. But we can be certain that he's capable of doing any or all of them. Letting ISIS run wild. Launching a nuclear attack. Starting a ground war. These are all distinct possibilities with Donald Trump in charge.And through all his loose talk, there's one constant theme: demonizing Muslims and playing right into the hands of ISIS'. His proposal to ban 1.5 billion Muslims from even coming to our country doesn't just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on. It's also a huge propaganda victory for ISIS. And it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight.A Trump Presidency would embolden ISIS. We cannot take that risk.This isn't reality television – this is actual reality.And defeating global terrorist networks and protecting the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans. It takes a real plan, real experience and real leadership. Donald Trump lacks all three.And one more thing. A President has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must, and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy. Our troops give their all. They deserve a commander-in-chief who knows that.I've worked side-by-side with admirals and generals, and visited our troops in theaters of war. I've fought for better health care for our National Guard, better services for our veterans, and more support for our Gold Star families. We cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in Donald Trump's hands.Sixth, we need to stay true to our values.Trump says over and over again, 'The world is laughing at us.' He's been saying this for decades, he didn't just start this year.He bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987, when Ronald Reagan was President, saying that America lacked a backbone and the world was – you guessed it – laughing at us. He was wrong then, and he's wrong now – and you've got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America, and has felt that way for at least 30 years, wants to be our President.The truth is, there's not a country in the world that can rival us. It's not just that we have the greatest military, or that our economy is larger, more durable, more entrepreneurial than any in the world. It's also that Americans work harder, dream bigger – and we never, ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place.So it really matters that Donald Trump says things that go against our deepest-held values. It matters when he says he'll order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists. During the raid to kill bin Laden, when every second counted, our SEALs took the time to move the women and children in the compound to safety. Donald Trump may not get it, but that's what honor looks like.And it also matters when he makes fun of disabled people, calls women pigs,proposes banning an entire religion from our country, or plays coy with white supremacists. America stands up to countries that treat women like animals, or people of different races, religions or ethnicities as less human.What happens to the moral example we set – for the world and for our own children – if our President engages in bigotry?And by the way, Mr. Trump – every time you insult American Muslims or Mexican immigrants, remember that plenty of Muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces.Donald Trump, Donald Trump could learn something from them.That brings me to the final point I want to make today – the temperament it takesto be Commander-in-Chief.Every President faces hard choices every day, with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives. That's the job.A revolution threatens to topple a government in a key region, an adversary reaches out for the first time in years – what do you do?Making the right call takes a cool head and respect for the facts. It takes a willingness to listen to other people's points of view with a truly open mind. It also takes humility – knowing you don't know everything – because if you're convinced you're always right, you'll never ask yourself the hard questions.I remember being in the Situation Room with President Obama, debating the potential Bin Laden operation. The President's advisors were divided. The intelligence was compelling but far from definitive. The risks of failure were daunting. The stakes were significant for our battle against al Qaeda and our relationship with Pakistan. Most of all, the lives of those brave SEALs and helicopter pilots hung in the balance.It was a decision only the President could make. And when he did, it was as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as I've ever seen.Now imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States. Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle. Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry, but America's entire arsenal.Do we want him making those calls – someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism? Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?I have a lot of faith that the American people will make the right decision. This is a country with a deep reservoir of common sense and national pride. We're all counting on that.Because making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake. It would undo so much of the work that Republicans and Democrats alike have done over many decades to make America stronger and more secure. It would set back our standing in the world more than anything in recent memory. And it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are – that we're fearful, not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us, instead of shaping our own destiny.That's not the America I know and love.So yes, we have a lot of work to do to keep our country secure. And we need to do better by American families and American workers – and we will. But don't let anyone tell you that America isn't great. Donald Trump's got America all wrong. We are a big-hearted, fair-minded country.There is no challenge we can't meet, no goal we can't achieve when we each do our part and come together as one nation.Every lesson from our history teaches us that we are stronger together. We remember that every Memorial Day.This election is a choice between two very different visions of America.One that's angry, afraid, and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline.The other is hopeful, generous, and confident in the knowledge that America is great – just like we always have been.Let's resolve that we can be greater still. That is what I believe in my heart.I went to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. And I never lost my sense of pride at seeing our blue-and-white plane lit up on some far-off runway, with? ?'The United States of America' emblazoned on the side. That plane – those words – our country represents something special, not just to us, to the world. It represents freedom and hope and opportunity.I love this country and I know you do too. It's been an honor and a privilege toserve America and I'm going to do everything I can to protect our nation, and make sure we don't lose sight of how strong we really are.Thank you all very much.","UCSB"
"48",2016-09-15,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro","""Thank you. Thank you all. Hello, everyone. It's great to be here at UNC Greensboro. I want to thank Martha for that wonderful introduction. It means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter, Sara, and her mother, Barbara. And the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like Sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them. So to see Sara grown up and thriving is very special, and your whole family's support really means the world to me. Thank you, Martha, Sara, BarbaraI have to say it's great to be back on the campaign trail. As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia. I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good. And I'm not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances. But with just two months to go until Election Day? Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.But it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift. I talked with some old friends. I spent time with our very sweet dogs. I did some thinking. The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection, and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then. And that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about.People like me – we're lucky. When I'm under the weather – now, I just want to have a conversation, and other people can wave their arms and their signs. But I want you to think with me for a minute about how I certainly feel lucky. When I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can't. They either go to work sick, or they lose a paycheck, don't they?Lots of Americans still don't even have insurance, or they do but it's too expensive for them to actually use. So they toss back some Tylenols, they chug orange juice, and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own.Lots of working parents can't afford childcare, which in many states costs as much as college tuition. So for millions of moms and dads, if they get sick, there's no backup. They're on their own, aren't they?That's the story for too many people still in America. When illness strikes, or an accident happens, you feel you're on your own. If you lose your job or can't afford college, you're on your own. If your aging parent starts needing more help, and you don't know what to do, you're on your own.Life events like these are catastrophic for some families, but mere bumps in the road for others. I have met so many people living on a razor's edge, one illness away from losing their job, one paycheck away from losing their home. And that goes against everything we stand for as Americans. Because some things should not come down to luck. Some things should be within reach for everyone, no matter what. Like financial security. Like affordable health care. Like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong, your family will be okay. And above all, the knowledge that no matter what, your president is fighting for you and will always have your back.That right there, that's why I got into this race. I am running for everyone working hard to support their families, everyone who's been knocked down but gets back up. The factory workers on their feet all day, and the nurses looking after patients all night. I'm running for young people like so many of you here, who dream of changing our world for the better, and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education.I'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen. And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina. Look at what's happening with the NCAA and the ACC. This is where bigotry leads, and we can't afford it – not here, not anywhere else in America. I'm running for women like Janelle Turner. Back in May of last year, Janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through nearly six months of very tough treatments. Last October, she brought her eight-year-old daughter to one of our rallies in Iowa and they made a huge sign that read, 'Thirteenth chemo yesterday. Three more. Hear me roar!' Wouldn't you want to meet the woman behind that sign? Well, I sure did. So we got talking, and we've stayed in touch. She keeps promising me she'll see me at the inauguration. And I tell her I'll keep working to get there, but she'd better be there too.I'm running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids. But perhaps most of all, I'm running for those kids. Standing up for children has been the work of my life. As a lawyer with the Children's Defense Fund, as First Lady in Arkansas, in the White House, as a Senator, I have fought for kids housed in adult jails, kids who have been neglected and abused, kids who couldn't get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions, kids with disabilities so they could go to school. You heard today from someone I've known for a long time, now grown up and a lovely young woman, Anastasia Somoza. I learned from my family and my Methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can. And to me, that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their God-given potentials.So when I meet a little girl in Nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported, it hits me right in the gut. When I meet a little boy in Flint, Michigan, who can't drink the water at home or in school because it's poisoned with lead, that gets me going. All I want to do is get to work making things better for them.That's why I care so much about national security too. I want to give our kids a safer world. To me, that means a world with strong allies, more friends, fewer enemies, and fewer nuclear weapons. It also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet.My opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts. Just a few days ago he said that if another country's troops taunted ours – not fired at them, but taunted them, just taunts – he'd responded – he would respond by blowing them out of the water. He would start a war over that. That is just one more reason, my friends, why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes.I've been involved in politics in one way or another for many years. It is not an easy business. It can get rough and I've built up some defenses. When it comes to public service, I'm better at the 'service' part than the 'public' part. But this is why I do it, and this is who I'm in it for: to make life better for children and families. And that's what this race has always been about for me.Well, now we're in the final stretch. There are just 54 days till Election Day. Just 54 days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes. And just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in North Carolina. Let's make these days count, particularly here, because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do – make it harder for young people to vote, harder for people of color, harder for people with disabilities, harder for the elderly. There can't be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person, every person of color, every person with a disability, every older person turns out and votes.So in these final days, let's try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesn't often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs, to create opportunity, to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future. Let's talk about what really matters.And here's my promise to you. I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way I will serve as your president should you give me that great honor – focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families.Next week, I'll go to Philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people; in Florida, to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyone's contributions, in-cluding people with disabilities; then I'll be back here in North Carolina, to meet with more working families. From now until November 8th, everywhere I go, I'm going to talk about my ideas for our country. My campaign has rolled out detailed plans in 38 different policy areas – yes, somebody actually counted. Everything from reining in Wall Street to creating good-paying jobs to fighting Alzheimer's to supporting people with autism. You see, I have this old-fashioned notion that if you're running for president, you should say what you plan to do, how you're going to get it done, and how you're going to pay for it. You can read it all on my website, hillaryclinton.com. We even put it in a new book called, you guessed it, Stronger Together. Get a copy of it because it tells you everything Tim Kaine and I intend to do.Now, like a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare. I sweat the details, whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the water in Flint, or how many North Carolina kids are in early enrichment programs, or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal. Because you know what? It's not a detail if it's your kid. It's not a detail if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president. Now, I confess, I'll never be the showman my opponent is, and that's okay with me. Just look at – look at the show he put on with Dr. Oz today. But I am going to deliver for you and your family, just like I did for Sarah all those years ago with the Children's Health Insurance Program, that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is. And I'll tell you something else. People accuse me of all kinds of things. You probably have seen that. But nobody ever accuses me of quitting. And I will never give up, I'll never walk away, no matter how tough the going gets. I'm actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his.We don't need a president who says the minimum wage is too high. We need a president who knows that Americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage. We don't need a president who wants to take away people's health coverage. We need a president who wants everyone to have quality, affordable health care. And we don't need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids. We don't need someone who rushes out a half-baked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms. We need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues, who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes. Ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side, respect your family, stand up and fight for you and your kids. That is who you should vote for on November 8th because as Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between Democrat or Republican. It's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It's also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations. People have to decide, are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe, or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of Americans have worked so hard to build? Now, I have a lot of confidence in the American people and in our country. My opponent keeps running us down, saying we're weak, a disaster, an embarrassment. Every time he says things like that, I think about Janelle and her strength in the face of cancer, or Martha and Sarah in the face of their health challenges, and that little boy in Flint, who gets up every day and goes to school even though he can't drink the water. See, my opponent has America all wrong. There's nothing we can't do when we come together as one nation, set big goals, and pursue them.And the American dream – the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. So if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, that no one who works full-time should have to raise their child in poverty, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions, join us. If you believe – if you believe your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay, then join us. Get involved these last 55 days. Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246. We need volunteers right here in North Carolina. We can't do this without you.And remember, the presidential race isn't the only one this fall. We've got a lot of im-portant statewide races. Let's come together and send Deborah Ross to represent the people in the Senate. Starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. So the heat is on. Spread the word. Tell your friends, your family, your neighbors. If you share our vision for America's future, come be part of helping us shape it. We do not have a minute to lose.We have so many blessings. Now it's our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person, and particularly every child, no matter who they are, what they look like, or who they love, is part of the American dream now and way into the future. Let that be our message. Let that be our mission. Please come out and help us fight, fight for you, fight for our children, fight for our families. Let's make America all that it should be. Thank you and God bless you!""","UCSB"
"50",2016-09-18,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks to the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C.","""Hello. It's so great to be back here with all of you tonight. I want to thank my friend, Congressman Jim Clyburn; Don Peebles; Representative Butterfield; members of the Congressional Black Caucus; and congratulate all of the honorees. On a personal note, I want to recognize a dear friend who is retiring after 46 years, Congressman Charles Rangel. He is one of a kind, and we are grateful for your years of service.And what can I say about one of the best Presidents this country has ever had, Barack Obama? All through this campaign, I have made the point over and over again, Presi-dent Obama saved our country from a second Great Depression. He brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And so much more. I, for one, don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing what he's done on behalf of our country and the world. And it's not just the President he's been, but the man he is. Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters, have represented our country with class, grace, and integrity. As Michelle says, 'When others go low, we go high.' I know I speak for not just everyone in this room but so many tens of millions of Americans: Mr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you're a great American! And you make us all proud to be Americans, too.Let me thank the leadership of the CBC Foundation for this great honor, and to thank all of my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for it as well. I dedicate it to all the trailblazers who came before me who blazed trails that I could follow in their footsteps – Barbara Jordan. Shirley Chisholm. I would not be standing here without them. Generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and cleared a path for all of us.This award is also for everyone out there helping to break down the barriers holding Americans back, to leaders like all of you, and to a rising generation of young activists. To all those on the front lines dedicated to the proposition that in America, every single child deserves the chance to fulfill his or her God-given potential. This has been the cause of my life ever since I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago. And I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way that I will serve as your president, focused on opportunities for our children and fairness for our families.We have so much work to do together. I've heard many heartbreaking stories over this campaign. One was from Tianna Gaines-Turner, a working mother to three children from Northeast Philadelphia. She testified at the DNC platform meeting in June and told us how her husband had been laid off and she worked in a part-time job. She said she'd been hungry more times than she could count, and that life felt like a maze, because she faced barriers no matter which way she turned. But despite all of this, Tianna has hope. She still believes that her 8-year-old daughter will be president one day. And she believes that this election can make all the difference in the world to her and her family. Let's prove her right.As a country, we have a moral obligation to give her family and every family a chance to rise up and reach their dreams. That is what's at stake in this election. It's not about golf course promotions or birth certificate. It comes down towho will fight for the forgotten, who will invest in our children, and who will really have your back in the White House.We need ideas, not insults, real plans to help struggling Americans in communities that have been left out and left behind, not prejudice and paranoia. We can't let Barack Obama's legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn't understand that, whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards. Instead, we need to come together, to get incomes rising with a higher minimum wage, to invest in neglected communities with efforts like Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 plan, to get guns out of the hands of dangerous people, to fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice, and to make sure that all kids have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip codes they live in.When you really think about it, the choice this November is about so much more than Democrats and Republicans. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic convention, it's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It's also about the kind of country we want to be, what we want to leave behind for future generations. I thank everyone here, who has been fighting for this vision over so many years. I thank all who have supported me. I want you to know I'm not taking your vote or anyone's vote for granted. I'm working every single day to earn your support. And I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together.Barbara Jordan famously said that a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation. So to everyone here tonight, please, keep doing what you're doing, but also help to register voters. Tell others about the clear choice in this election. In some states, early voting is nearly here, so we need to keep the pressure on. Let's send a loud and clear message once and for all: We are stronger together. And no matter what, remember this: Love trumps hate. Thank you all very much!""","UCSB"
"53",2016-09-27,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, North Carolina","""Thank you! Boy! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Did anybody see that debate last night? Oh, yes. One down, two to go. I am so excited to be back here at Wake Tech. I was here 8 years ago, and I was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like Christine that I wanted to come back, of course, to Raleigh, but I wanted to come back here to Wake Tech. When Christine was talking, I was backstage watching her on a screen we had there. And she kept saying about how she was about to cry. I was about to cry. Her story says so much, not just about her but about our country. We are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them, get up every day, do their best. That's the basic bargain of America. And I was really proud of Christine.Audience Member: We're proud of you!Clinton: Thank you. Thank you. And I think her – I think her patients at Duke Regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at Wake Tech but that personality, that get-up-and-go personality, is going to mean a lot to the people she's taking care of. So Christine, thank you and Godspeed.Now, I have to thank – I have to thank Dr. Stephen Scott, the president of Wake Tech Community College, all the administrators, the faculty, and the students of Wake Tech. Now, Dr. Scott told me that the enrollment's about 73,000. And what a tribute to what this institution represents. And I am a huge, huge supporter. I just see America differently. I think there's nothing we can't do if we make our minds up, roll up our sleeves, get working together, support institutions like Wake Tech, support people like Christine. And that's what I intend to do.Now, I want to thank your mayor, Mayor McFarlane. Thank you so much for being here. State Senator Dan Blue, Jr. I also want to recognize Linda Coleman, candidate for lieutenant governor of North Carolina. Linda came so close last time. And this time are you going to bring her over the finish line? And I'll tell you somebody else I'm really excited about. That is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, former State Representative Deborah Ross. I have watched – I have watched the campaign she's run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it. I'll tell you what, we sure could use her in Washington representative North Carolina. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here, and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husband's and mine, somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship. That's former Governor Jim Hunt.Now, there's a lot that I want to talk about today. But let me start with this because you may or may not know. Today is National Voter Registration Day. And you see some signs people are holding. 'I Will Vote.' Now, that's not only a great sign that shows you're committed to vote, but it's a website. And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered. And I hope you all will, and I hope you'll tell everybody that you know to do the same, because we want to make sure people are registered.And there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina, and I hope that you will, because think about everything that's at stake in this election right here in North Carolina. The very mean-spirited, wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state. But more than that, it's hurt people. It has sent a message to so many people that, well, you're not really wanted. You're not really part of us. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.The other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people. Now, they were pretty blatant about it. Make it harder for people of color. Make it harder for the elderly. And make it harder for the young. Now, some of that's been rolled back, thankfully, because it was so wrong and, I would argue, unconstitutional. But the best way to show, hey, in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous, vibrant debate, that's what it's about. But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote. That's the way we're supposed to be making decisions. It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that.Now, I have won elections and I have lost elections, so I know what the difference is. But I'll tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us, to govern ourselves, to continue to widen the circle of opportunity, and that includes the opportunity to be heard, to express yourself, your voice and your vote. And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote, and demonstrate the importance of your vote. I believe that we may have a record-setting turnout in this election. Some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout we've ever had. Now, that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future, and who we are fighting for. But early information is actually quite encouraging. We're seeing spikes in early voting. And we're seeing voting rates among African Americans, Latinos, and young people going up. And for the first time, the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote.Now, I would love to see that. Obviously, I hope people vote for me. But I would love to see that because every election is about the future. And honestly, it's more about the future of young people and children than it's ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent.Now, last night I got a chance – I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president. And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do. And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren.And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren. I think about that a lot, in part because I started out working for the Children's Defense Fund. It's always been my passion about what we can do [applause] to help more kids live up to their God-given potential.And during this campaign, people have asked me, 'Well, how did you get interested in that?'And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood. She was basically abandoned by her parents, sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her. By the age of 14, she was out on her own working in a home babysitting, keeping house. She was basically a maid. And when I think about my mother's own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers, she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people.We overlook the importance of just how we treat each other, the respect we show, the kindness, the love that we show. And I'm well aware that's not something you put necessarily on a campaign website, but I've been talking about it because I think we've got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other.When my mother was in first grade, she never had any food, and her first grade teacher noticed that. In those days, they just brought food, a little bag of food, then they'd sit in the classroom and eat it, and my mother never had any food. And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her. She would say, 'You know, Dorothy, I brought too much food. Would you like this sandwich? Would you like this milk?' And it wasn't until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year, something she didn't have to do, but her love for her students, her recognition of a child who wasn't well taken care of meant that she stepped in.And then when my mother worked as a maid, she really wanted to go to high school. She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents' home. And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school, and so she said to her, 'If you get up early – it sounds like Christine getting up so early. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.' And that's what my mother did for four years, she got up early and then she literally had to run, run to get to high school. It sounds harsh, but not for my mom. She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live, gave her food to eat, gave her the chance to go to high school.So when I talk about us being stronger together, I'm not just talking about what our government needs to do, I'm talking about what each of us can do to contribute. We do need to make sure – we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top, and that means we've got to make investments in more good, new jobs, infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, technology and innovation, clean renewable energy jobs. And we've got to do more to help small businesses because that's where most of the new jobs will come from.As I said last night, my dad was a small businessman. When he got out of the Navy after World War II, he started this small business printing drapery fabrics, and he had a print plant in Chicago. It was just – it was dark room. There was no natural light. He had two long tables and he'd spread that fabric on the table, and then he would take silkscreens – if you've ever seen one – and he'd start at one end and he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, and he'd take the squeegee and he'd lift it up and he'd go all the way down to the end of one table, and then he'd start on the other table, and he would do that until he got the job done. And I would help him out from time to time, so I knew how hard he worked. But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker. And so he was able to do what we want to see in America, keep going, keep reaching, move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you.So I want us to have an economy that works for everyone, to grow the economy, to create more jobs, but I also want a fairer economy because – when you work hard, you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year. But if you are a minimum wage worker, if you work full time minimum wage, you will make $15,000 a year. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women, most of them with families to support. And I've talked to a lot of these women. Sometimes I'll be at a cafй or sometimes I'll be in a store and I'll just start talking to them, and they will tell me – it's one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if you're open to it, folks will tell you what's on their minds and their hearts.So I've met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids. So we need to raise the national minimum wage and – and we need to guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work because – number one, it's fair. It's fair. And if your mother, your wife, your sister, or your daughter is working, don't you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?And the other thing I want to do, I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place. It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives. I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work.And last night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. Now, Mark Cuban, who is a real billionaire, by the way, he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business, and he not only used it while the business was going, but when the business was sold. He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight.Now, that's the kind of business leadership I want to hold up, because what we've seen from my opponent is someone, who his own campaign manager has said, builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy, stiffing people – dishwashers, painters, plumbers, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers – across America. Some of them have come forward. You can go to our website; you can see their stories. It's heartbreaking. And as I said last night, I'm really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business.And in addition to making the economy fair, we've got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work. It's really hard out there, isn't it? And just listening to Christine's story – getting up at 4:00 and studying, getting kids up at 7:00, going to school, going to work, going to another job – that's not an uncommon story. We've made it really hard for a lot of people.So here's what I think we need to do, and it's not a luxury, it's a necessity – because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them. And I've heard so many stories. They've told me – people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they're under. So let's finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let's have paid family leave so that when you're sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones. And let's have earned sick days so that you don't lose your job because you're sick or you go to work because you're sick. And let's finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition. I don't think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we're going to fix that so that becomes the norm. And then let's make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget.Now, tomorrow in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary. And I want – I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way. And we're also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner.Now, how are we going to do that? Well, we're going to go where the money is, and the money is at the top. We're going to go after millionaires, billionaires and corporations. We're going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, and we're going to close corporate loopholes. And I believe that we can get that done, in part because you're going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so we're going to have another Democratic senator. But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again – not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence. That hasn't worked out so well. We've got to get back to first principles. Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go. Let's be a government for the struggling, the striving and the successful.So I'm excited about what we can do. I really am. And I'm going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of – all of Donald Trump's claims. There were – there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night. But here's a couple of things that caught my attention. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years. And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets. But he probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems.And when I confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns – and I got to that point where I said, well, maybe he's paid zero – he said that makes him smart. Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed. We didn't come from millionaire families. My husband's father – his biological father died before he was born. His mother went to nursing school in order to support him. They struggled. They worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President. My dad, as I told you, worked hard.So Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years. And if you look, you'll see that we paid the highest marginal rate. We tried to give 10 percent to charity. Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that we've been given, we should do our part.The other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen. I don't think I'd make a big bragging point out of that. But he seemed to feel like, hey, it shows you how smart I am. He basically said, 'Yeah, if the housing market crashes, I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money.' I got to tell you, what kind of person believes that? What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes? One who should never be president is the answer to that question.And he made it very clear that he didn't prepare for that debate. At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared. But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort. And I said, 'Yeah. You know what? I did prepare. And I'll tell you something else I prepared for. I prepared to be president of the United States, and I think that's good.'So as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here. I believe we are stronger together. That is at the core of what I've done over my years in advocacy and public service. I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater. I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners. I've laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues. I've laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS. And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It's unclear exactly what he is saying.But words matter. And last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in Asia, ""Hey, we're not sure we're going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty."" Words matter. People here that and they start to doubt America's word, America's intention. I felt like I had to jump in and say, 'I just want to be clear. We will honor our treaties. We will support our allies and our partners.' This is not reality TV. This is real. It's as real as it gets. so we're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We're going to keep America safe, provide strong, steady leadership, and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted Americans against each other. Economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night, are they? There's still a lot we don't know about the recent incidents in Tulsa and Charlotte, but this we do know: We've got to bring communities together. We have to listen to each other. We have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect, and respect for the law from the communities that are protected. And we've got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many, too many lives in our country. Again, I think we can come together. A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks. They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do. They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do. But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them.So there's work to do. But it's great work. It's important work, starting right here in North Carolina. We have 42 days left. This election's going to be close. They all are these days. That's why every call you make, every door you knock on, every friend you register to vote, to make the difference. I want you, if you can, to text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer here in North Carolina. And I know there's a big overflow room, and I'm told they can hear me, so to my friends in the overflow, we want you to be just as involved as anyone else. Thank you for coming.So remember, here in North Carolina, starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. And remember, it's not just the presidential race. It's the governor's race, the lieutenant governor's race, the U.S. Senate race, and other races up and down the ticket. Because we want to prove who we are as Americans in this election. We're not fearful. We don't want to build walls. We want to build bridges. We don't want to turn against each other. We want to work with one another. We want to set big goals again here in our country.I've got some big goals that I know we can achieve. Take climate change, which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen, and I want us to take advantage of that. Do the right thing and benefit from it. That's what I'm offering. We're going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration. And we will produce enough clean power to power every home in America within 10 years. And we're going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Now, the way things are stacking up, I think it's either going to be Germany, China, or us. I want it to be us and it will be us.That is exactly right. I love this country. I'm proud of this country. I want to be a leader who brings people together in our country, sets those goals, gets about the business of achieving them, and proves once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you!""","UCSB"
"54",2016-09-28,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the University of New Hampshire in Durham","""Thank you. Thank you all so much. It is great being here on the stage at UNH with my friend Bernie Sanders, one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that I have ever seen and someone who I am looking forward to working with to get [cheers] the kind of agenda through our Congress that will begin to make our country stronger by providing the kind of support that working families and middle class families so richly deserve.Bernie's campaign energized so many young people, some of you in this crowd. And there is no group of Americans who have more at stake in this election than young Americans because so much of what will happen will affect your lives, your jobs, the kind of country we are, the kind of future we want to build together.I'm proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran. We ran a campaign about issues, not insults. And when it was over, we began to work together to try to figure out how we could take the issues we agreed on and come together knowing we are stronger together to come up with specific policies in education, in health and so much else. Thank you, Bernie. Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for your support in this campaign.Now, we're going to need some help in Washington. And I hope New Hampshire will send your now Governor Maggie Hassan to Washington as your senator. And I sure hope you will send Carol Shea Porter back to Washington.Isn't this one of the strangest elections you've ever seen? I – I really sometimes don't know what to make of it. Standing on that debate stage the other night, I was especially thinking about that. And, look, I have been very clear about what I want to do if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president. And Americans increasingly are zeroing in on the fact that we're not only electing a president, we're electing a commander-in-chief. We're looking to see who can protect our country and provide steady and strong leadership around the world.I was very honored today to earn the endorsement of John Warner, a retired Republican senator, World War II veteran, former – former secretary of the Navy who served under two Republican presidents. I served with him on the Senate Armed Services Committee. And I have the deepest respect for his patriotism. And it's a great honor. He's never endorsed a Democrat for president before. And I'm also very grateful that a number of Republicans and Independents here in New Hampshire have announced their support for this campaign. In fact, it is really an extraordinary honor that 150 Republicans here in New Hampshire are supporting this campaign because they understand how high the stakes are. The next – the next 40 days will determine the next 40 years. So I'm going to close my campaign the way I started my public service and my career: fighting for kids and families. That's been the cause of my life. And it will be the mission of my presidency. And when you go to vote in November or if you vote early, it's not just my name on the ballot. Every issue you care about, think about it because, in effect, it's on the ballot, too. It's whether or not we continue to fight climate change or we give in to denial. This is a big deal. I never thought when I gave my acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention that I would have to put in the following sentence, 'I believe in science.' Climate change is real. It's serious. And we have to be united and committed in addressing it. I never thought I'd hear someone running for president, my opponent, who says he wants to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality and turn the clock back on LGBT Americans, overturn a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and reverse that fundamental right and so much more.So there's a lot at stake. And that's why some of the analysts are saying more Americans will vote in this election than ever before. We had more people watching that debate than any presidential debate before. And that's why we have to focus on what we want to do because I want to make a difference in your lives.And one of the biggest issues that I heard about throughout the campaign that I hear about from every corner of our country is how much an education costs. Bernie is absolutely right. I remember when I went to college, my dad, who was a small business man – he had saved up money, but I had to work. I had to work through college, work during the school year, work during summers, but that was okay. We were able to put it together. It wasn't so much that it endangered me or my family's financial future.And then I decided to go to law school, and my dad said, 'Well, I can't help you. That – we're done. We can't help you.' So I kept working. I got a small scholarship, but then I took out loans. And I paid those loans back. But I was lucky because I signed up for a program that gave me the opportunity to pay my loans back as a percentage of my in-come, not a fixed interest rate. That's why I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund. I think I made $14,000 a year, as I recall. I could never have done that if I had had the kind of interest rates that so many young people now are facing.It's absolutely wrong, and it has undermined the fundamental right to pursue your dreams, to have that education, to get those opportunities that you so rightly deserve.Now, New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt in the country and the second-highest average debt per student. As a student I met here in New Hampshire said, going to college should be hard, but paying for college shouldn't be so hard that it prevents you from getting your education.Indeed, here in New Hampshire, we've got so many young people graduating with debt who aren't able to get started in their careers, aren't able to do the jobs like I could do, because they have to get a job that pays as much as possible to begin paying their debt down. So we should, and we will, make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year.And if you already have student debt, like so many students have here in New Hamp-shire, we will help you refinance it. It is absolutely outrageous that you cannot refinance student debt, and it is even worse that you're being charged interest rates that are so much higher than anything that anybody else is paying to buy a house, to buy a car, to borrow money for a business. I don't know how we got to where we are, but we are going to fix it. This is wrong. It's wrong for students, it's wrong for families, and it's wrong for our country.I also have met a lot of young people who want to start a business. They want to be entrepreneurs. It's the classic American story; start that business in the garage or the basement; get going. But they can't get credit because they have student debt. Nobody will help them out, no matter how good the idea is. So we're going to put a moratorium, so you don't have to pay your student debt back for a couple of years while you try to get your business started, and you get the chance to get the credit you need.We are also – we are also going to provide loan forgiveness for people willing to go into public service or national service. And in Florida on Friday I'll give a speech about why that is so important.Now, when you add it up, our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars. Our campaign has built a tool to help you see how our college plan will actually help you, not in general, but really specifically you, the situation you're in. To check it out, go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator.Now, we have an example right here, and this presentation is what you can see when you go to our website. You can say, 'I have student debt,' you can say, 'I am planning for college,' you can put in what your annual household income is, how much you will save, and we are trying to make it as specific as possible because I don't want anybody to miss out on what this plan can do for you. You can choose whether you have student debt.I met a young woman just yesterday in North Carolina who said, 'Nobody really ex-plained to me and my family what I was getting into.' I hear that so much. You know, these financial aid forms, one is called FAFSA, it takes forever to fill out, and at the end of it you really don't know what it means? Well, we're going to be really explicit. You know, we do have technology in America. And we ought to use it more to help people understand what they're getting into and to provide alternatives so that they don't make the wrong decisions for themselves.So, please, use this, you know? You will save $60,640 if you're in one of these categories. But there is a way to understand the choices you have to make for everybody. So I hope you will go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator.But I have to say this: none of this will happen if you all don't turn out and vote. None of it. You know, I see all the signs saying, 'I will vote.' There is also a website. Please go to iwillvote.com to make sure you're registered. All the information is there. You put in your name, you put in your address, and through the miracle of technology you can find out if you're registered, or maybe because you moved you were purged from the records and you have to register again. New Hampshire makes it easy. You can have same-day registration.So both Bernie and I are excited about what we can do together. I am really looking forward to working with him and other strong Democrats and Republicans who want to help solve problems again in America. Bringing people together is what I'm going to spend a lot of my time doing as your president. And if you've had a chance to see or meet my running mate, Tim Kaine, you know how hard he'll work to get things done and make it a high priority to produce results.So we're going to move now to the panel, and I'm very pleased to have Mary Jo Brown moderating, along with Doug Martin, who you heard from earlier. I know they have collected up questions from the crowd. But I will end by saying that I'm excited about what we can do to make college affordable, and especially as Bernie rightly said, open the doors to families and young people who have been left out. We also want to make Pell grants once again available year-round, and we want to make sure that we have – specific help for certain groups of students.I'll end with this story. I taught at the University of Arkansas Law School some years ago, and I met a lot of students, not only in the law school but students on campus. I'd go and eat with them and go to events with them, and I met a lot of students who scraped together the tuition money, but then something happened. You know, maybe they were already parents and their childcare fell apart. Maybe they had to drive to and from school; they lived out in the country and their old car finally broke down and there was no public transportation. Or maybe they had a health emergency. And they would come and they would say to me, 'What can I do? Where can I get the $300 to fix the car? Where can I find childcare? How can I pay the doctor's bills?'And I realized that we've got to take care of tuition, making sure that you can go and be able to start and finish school. We've got to make sure costs and expenses, Pell grants and other ways of helping. But we also have to fill the gaps that exist for a lot of students. So I helped to start something called the Arkansas Single-Parent Scholarship Fund, because the people who had the most unexpected expenses were young parents, mostly, but not always, single moms, young, divorced, pretty much on their own, trying to improve their lives and prospects.And we started a fund to help fill those gaps, and, you know, we did it over so many years now, about 35 years, and we've helped thousands of people, so they didn't have to drop out. They didn't have to cut back. That's what I want for our country again, where we're helping each other, where we're reaching out and giving everybody a chance, and, yes, sometimes a second or third chance, to make the most of their lives, to pursue their dreams. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody, and education is absolutely essential to it. So please make sure you come out and vote in this election. Thank you, all.""","UCSB"
"55",2016-09-29,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Cowles Commons in Des Moines, Iowa","""Thank you! Thank you all so much. Wow! I am so happy to be back here in Iowa on a beautiful fall day to see all of you. And I especially want to thank Janelle for her intro-duction. And I so appreciate that Janelle and Nora and her husband Stu are here today. I remember so well when I met her back in 2015, and I saw that sign. And my best friend from sixth grade was also going through breast cancer and being treated. And when I saw Janelle's sign, it just made me think about my friend, and I wanted to go over and meet this woman who had been through 13 chemo treatments already. And we just clicked. And I have been so grateful to be able to get to know her better and spend time with her when I see her. And I got to introduce her to my best friend when my best friend came to Iowa. So the circle is completed, and more people are reaching out and finding ways to help each other.Now, before I came out, I had the great, great privilege of saying hello to someone, Ruline Steininger, who is – is Ruline still here? I know she was going to try to stay. There she is. Hello, Ruline! Hello, Ruline! Ruline is a 103-year-old resident of Pleasant Hill who was born in 1913. I am so grateful for her support, and I don't know if any of you have seen the videos, both about Janelle and about Ruline. But I really do recommend that you see them both. Ruline talks about this long, active life that she's had and everything she has seen happen in America and the world. And I think it's important to have that perspective. So it's a great honor to have Ruline supporting me. I am so pleased. And she's going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts. I want to thank Dr. Andy McGuire for chairing the Iowa Democratic Party, fighting so hard to elect Democrats. And I want to lift up and thank our Democratic Senate candidate, Patty Judge. Where's Patty? Patty's out there fighting hard every single day, and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the Senate. And Jim Mowrer, the 3rd District congressional candidate. Jim is running a great campaign, and we are really looking forward to having him in Washington. But that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of Iowa.Now, while we're meeting on this beautiful day here in Des Moines, I know our friends in Cedar Rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding. I talked with the mayor. I talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so. They hope that they will not have the flooding. They took a lot of good precautionary measures. Our campaign, along with thousands of people, came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding. And I told them that if I'm so fortunate enough as to be president, we're going to have a big infrastructure program, and we're going to help prevent flooding in places like Cedar Rapids. Now, I also just want to say on a personal note I was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in New Jersey. That's very personal to me. I live in New York. People commute into New York from New Jersey. We had about a hundred commuters injured and one died. I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because it's a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage. So I want to lift up the people of New Jersey and New York today.Now, we are starting to vote in Iowa today! And I saw my good friend Ruth Harkin, and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today. And we have, what, 40 days, 39 days, left. And each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path. We have 40 days to win an election that's going to affect the next 40 years of our country. And you, every one of you, can make the difference in this election.Now, how many of you participated in the caucuses? Well, we've got a bunch of active Iowans here. Are you ready to go to the polls? Well, luckily, in Iowa you can start today. Lots of folks don't have that opportunity across the country. And a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites. We've got one right down the street. So when you finish here, you can go vote. And we can be on the path to victory here in Iowa.Any of you see that debate on Monday night? Well, one down, two to go. Well, I have to tell you, it was an extraordinary experience because I did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because I want this election to be about something, not just against somebody. And so I am going to close this campaign the way I started decades ago, fighting for kids and families because it's been the cause of my life. It will be the mission of my presidency because I know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong America. And I know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work, their talent, will take them.Now, you may have heard me say this. I started talking about this way back in the be-ginning of the campaign here in Iowa. But I was very fortunate. None of us picks our parents. But I really was fortunate. My dad was a Navy veteran, a small businessman, and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security, a good, solid, middle class life. And I know how hard he worked because occasionally I'd go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies. And it was not a very big building. It didn't have any natural life. There were no windows in it. It's what he could afford.And there were two long tables. And he'd roll out the fabric, and then he would take a silkscreen. Any of you ever seen a silkscreen, an old-fashioned silkscreen? Not far from here there's a wonderful t-shirt store. Right? And they still use silkscreens for some of their printing. So he would take that silkscreen, and he'd put it down, and he would pour the paint in. Then he'd take a squeegee and he'd go across it. And then he'd lift it up, and he'd go all the way down the table. And if there was going to be more than one color, he'd do it all over again. And then when he finished, he would gather it up and put it in his car and he'd go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it.That's how I was raised to think about doing business. You do your best. You enter into a contract or an agreement. Somebody orders your goods or your services. And then they pay you for it. Right? And as I said the other night, one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him, Donald Trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy. Her words. And I have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts, to pay what had been bargained for. I just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldn't have survived all that.All that work, and then to be told we're not going to pay you, or maybe we'll pay you 10 cents on the dollar, or 20 cents? That's just wrong. What kind of person does that, takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people? We've been looking into the records, and there's a long list of people who have been mistreated. I just don't believe that's the way we're supposed to treat each other in America. And that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country. Now, my mom had a very different story. My dad's father was a factory worker, but they had a strong family. My mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents, and they didn't want her. So she was out on her own by the age of 14. She was working as a housemaid and a babysitter. And it may sound harsh, but I will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other. So for her, it was a gift.And then she got another gift. The woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school. And so the woman said, 'If you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school, you can go to high school. But you'll have to come right back.' That may sound harsh for a 14-year-old, but for my mother it made all the difference. And that's exactly what she did for four years, and most days she had to run – run – to get there. But she didn't care because she wanted to get an education.So when I learned more about my mom's life, I knew that what I wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families, and especially for kids who've been left out or left behind in some way. That's why I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then, and we worked to put together a coalition and convince Congress to pass the law, and boy, every day I am so thankful for your former Senator Tom Harkin, who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career.So that's been my mission: How are we going to do more to help kids and families? And so when I talk about the economy – because I think we have three big issues facing us. Number one, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, right? We need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership, in accordance with our values. And we need to bring our country together. We have to heal these divides.But when I think about the economy, yes, I want more new, good jobs with rising in-comes. I see my friends from the laborers here. We need to do work that builds our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our tunnels, our water systems, our sewer systems. This is good, honorable work, and boy, do we have a lot of it in America. We are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents – and sometimes even great-grandparents – made. If we're going to have a competitive economy, we need to be building America again. And we also need to do more advanced manufacturing. And some of the most exciting developments I saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in Iowa. I saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that I've seen anywhere in the country. And I met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers, and as designers using 3-D printing. I was so impressed. And I think we need to do that across America. And we need to bring technical education back to our high schools. It was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools.Another way that Iowa has influenced and inspired me is what you've done with clean renewable energy. Now, it wasn't a partisan issue in Iowa. It really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor, Tom Vilsack. But it's been continued over the years. And look at the results. Look how much energy you are getting here in Iowa from clean renewable sources, most particularly wind. Right? And look at the number of jobs – it's nearly 10,000 jobs now that are related to that. Plus the renewable fuel standard, which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material. I was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future, and I'm excited by that.I'm running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I know it's real. I believe in science. But I'll tell you what else is real. What's real are the economic opportunities, the new jobs and businesses we're going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change, and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that. Now, we also need to help small businesses. Iowa is filled with small businesses. It should be easier to start one, it shouldn't be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations. We're going to try to streamline that process. Being the daughter of a small businessperson, I believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands. And we're going to work hard. I want to be a first-class small business president, in honor of my dad, and I'm going to do everything I can to help you get started, and grow small businesses. But while we're growing the economy, we need to make it fairer. And here are a couple of things I want to do. Let's raise the national minimum wage, so people who work full-time are not still in poverty. I've met – you know, two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women – and I've met a lot of minimum-wage workers right here in Iowa and across America. Sometimes they have to take two minimum-wage jobs, because a full-time minimum wage job will earn you $15,000 at the end of a full-time year of work. We also could give the biggest boost to incomes, and particularly family incomes, if we finally guaranteed equal pay for women's work.And the other thing I want to do is make sure more companies adopt profit-sharing, so if you helped to create the profits, all of you, not just the top executives, will be able to share in those profits. You know, at the debate the other night, one of my well-known supporters, Mark Cuban, was there in the front row. And he really, I think, unsettled my opponent. But I'll tell you, Mark Cuban's a real billionaire who actually uses profit-sharing, and not only while the business is ongoing, but one thing I really appreciate: first business he sold, he shared the profits with all of his employees. 300 employees became millionaires, because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company, all together.And the final point I want to make about this is about family economics. You know, let's tackle the cost of childcare. Between 2000 and 2012, childcare costs went up 25 percent. Incomes barely budged, right? So we're going to increase federal investment, and provide more tax relief to working families, so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare. Now, if you don't have small children or grandchildren right now, you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities. A lot of families are just so stressed out.The other thing I want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies, and provide paid family leave, so you can take care of your family members. Now, a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies, adopted babies, and of course that's a big part of it. Last year, in Newton, a mom said to me, I'm counting on you to know what it's like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work. Right?That's a lot of you. There you are. Okay. And I've got to tell you, I hear that all over. When my granddaughter was born and I was in the hospital with my daughter, I was talking to one of the nurses, and I said, so what is your biggest worry? She said, well, my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work. Right back to work. But it's not just for babies. It's for sick children, sick spouses, elderly members of your family who are having health problems. There is nothing more important than caring for each other. And I will tell you, it is wrong to make it so difficult for American families.The other big expense for family economics is education. Every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools, no matter what zip code they live in, right? And we also have to make college affordable. Yesterday in New Hampshire, I was with my friend and my former opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders. I am very proud of the campaign that Bernie and I ran. It was a campaign about issues, not insults. And we shared a lot of the same goals, even though we have different ways of getting there. And so after it was over, he and I sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together. And one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is $125,000 or less. And to make it debt-free for everybody else, so that you only pay what you can afford to pay, without going into debt.Now, right now, Iowans hold more than $12 billion in outstanding federal student loans. An education should give you a boost, not hold you back. And we're going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt. We have 40 million people who already have student debt in America, 300,000 of them right here in Iowa. We're going to help you refinance. It is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent, a car payment at 2 percent, and I met people in Iowa who were paying 8, 10, 12 percent interest on their student loans. I'll tell you what. I am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations.And college is crucial, but this is not said often enough. Four-year college is not, and should not, be the only path to a good job that supports a middle-class life. So we're going to have real apprenticeships, not the kind where you're told, 'you're fired,' but the kind where you're told, 'you're hired.' We're going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill.So I'm excited about what we can do together. I know so much of this campaign has been about, you know, whatever my opponent says, and who he attacks, and who he derides and denigrates. And the list is long. But it's not about that. It's about you. It's about your families and your futures, and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job. Now, I have this old-fashioned idea. I'm asking for your vote. I should tell you what I'm going to do, what my plans are. So Tim Kane and I have actually put out this little paperback book. And I see somebody holding one in the front row. It's called, not surprisingly, 'Stronger Together.' You can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport, wherever they sell paperbacks. And you can see what we're trying to do, and where we're going to get the money to pay for it. And the simple answer to that is, we're going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support America.Now, my friends, my opponent has a very different vision for America. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes, maybe not paying any taxes at all. And what I really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on America. Calling us a third world country. Saying our military is a disaster. That everything about America is in bad shape. But then it's probably true, he hasn't paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military, or our vets, or our schools, or our roads, or our education systems. He actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes. He says that makes him smart.Well, I'll tell you what, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make the rest of us? My husband and I have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public. You can go and look at them, and you can see that we've been blessed, and we're grateful for that. But we have paid the highest marginal tax rates, and we are glad we could, because we have both benefited from this great country of ours, and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that.Donald Trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and -9. Think about that. Five million families lost their homes. And he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it. He even said that it is just business. Well, what kind of person believes that – that throwing people out of their homes, foreclosing on them, destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business? Well, I'll tell you, that's a person who should never be president because they don't understand the American dream and how hard it is for people to make it.So look, I think after – Thank you. I think after what we saw Monday night, we'll have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare. I have no idea what he's going to say the next time. But you know, I will spend some time preparing for it.But we can't do any of the things that I just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help. The future of our country, the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot. It breaks my heart to see all the mean-spirited, divisive, bigoted things that are being said in our country. We can have our differences, for heaven sakes. We're Americans; that's in our DNA. But we should respect one another. We should listen to one another. That's the way we're going to get things done together.And so I want you to join this campaign. The election will be close, but we can win Iowa and we're going to win on November 8th. So if you can, text 'Join,' J-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. If you're not sure if you're registered, see these signs, 'I Will Vote?' Iwillvote.com. You can go to iwillvote.com, put in your name and your address, to make sure you're registered. Because sometimes people get dropped off the registration lists and they are surprised when they show up to vote that they're not on it. So check that out. And then, vote, and get everybody you know to vote. And I hope that a lot of you will go to vote after today, after this beautiful rally we're having. Because we will prove that we are stronger together. And you know what else we'll prove? We will prove that love trumps hate.Thank you all very much.""","UCSB"
"56",2016-09-30,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Coral Springs Gymnasium in Coral Springs, Florida","""Thank you! Whoa! Thank you so much. And I am so happy to be here in Coral Springs, in Broward County, in the great state of Florida! And I know there's a big overflow crowd in the next building over. I think they can see and hear us, but I wanted to thank them for being part of today's event.And I've got to recognize Joshua Simmons, who just introduced me. He is a civics teacher at Pompano Beach Middle School, and boy, are his students lucky to have him and his enthusiasm. And I want to also commend him for talking about his mother and how hard she worked, and his sister who he helped to raise. We really are stronger together, and that starts in families and neighborhoods and communities.Well, you heard from a lot of my friends who represent you, starting with my great friend and former colleague, your Senator Bill Nelson. And I am looking forward to working with Bill as we make sure to continue the progress that will move us all forward together. And I sure hope Florida sends some reinforcements to the Senate and elect Congressman Patrick Murphy. I think Florida deserves a full-time senator, don't you? And I want to thank my friend, someone who has just worked her heart out not just for her constituents but for Democrats across America – Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And another great friend of mine going back more years than we care to remember – I'm so pleased he's here with us – Congressman Alcee Hastings. And I know that Congressman Ted Deutch, who represents this district – is over in Israel for the funeral of a great, great man, Shimon Peres, and I want to thank Ted for all of his support and his hard work.Before I get started and really talk about everything that's at stake and what we have to do the next 39 days to make sure we win this election, I wanted to say a few words about the tragic passing of Jose Fernandez. When he left Cuba, he did not speak a word of English. He didn't let that stop him. He pursued his dreams. He wanted to and he became one of the best baseball players that Miami has ever seen. And he never forgot where he came from. He worked hard to give back to the community that had given so much to him. Jose's life really embodied the American dream, and at 24 years of age, he was just getting started. I'm sure you join me in saying that our thoughts and our prayers are with his family, with his fans, and everyone whose life he touched during his extraordinary career.I also want to mention another resident of Coral Springs, and that's a man named Bob Levinson. My heart goes out to Bob's family. He disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago, and it is long past time for the Iranian regime to provide us information about his whereabouts and let him return home to his family.Now, did any of you see the debate the other night? Well, I think it was pretty clear there are two very different choices for our country based on two very different visions of the kind of America that we want to have. My view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead. I believe America is an exceptional nation. My opponent believes America is in decline. I've never heard such a dark and divisive, terrible image of our country coming from someone running to be president of the United States. When he talks, I lots of times don't even recognize the country he's talking about. And why are we already great? Well, it is not just because of the size of our economy or the size of our military. It is because of our generosity; it is because of our ingenuity; it is because of the diversity of our country. I think our diversity is one of our strongest assets.This morning, I laid out my plan for more national service so that more people of all ages can serve America, serve their communities. Because America is great, when you really strip it all down, because America is good. And we can't ever forget that.I have laid out specific plans about how we're going to make our country even greater. I've actually got a book here with Tim Kaine, my running mate. I have this old-fashioned idea: if I'm asking you for your vote for president, I should tell you what I'm going to do. I shouldn't just talk in generalities and use rhetoric and never answer questions about what we can do, but to lay out how we're going to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. That means new jobs – new jobs with rising incomes, jobs in infrastructure, jobs in advanced manufacturing, in innovation and technology, and yes, clean, renewable energy jobs.My opponent's only infrastructure plan is to build a wall. I love that he went down to Mexico and he choked. He didn't even raise it. He's been going around telling people for months, 'We're going to build a wall and we're going to make Mexico pay for it.' So he's sitting with the president of Mexico and he doesn't even bring it up. He finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of Mexico about building a wall. I mean, really, who gets up at 3 o'clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe? I mean, he hurled as many insults as he could. Really, why does he do things like that? I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him. It proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief. I have said it before and I'll say it again: A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes.So I'm going to keep talking about what we can do together after this election. Getting those new jobs. And I'll tell you, another area I want to emphasize is small business. As I said the other night, my dad was a small businessman. He made a lot of sacrifice and he worked really hard to give us a good, solid, middle-class life. I'm really proud of that. And I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, who stiffs small businesses, doesn't pay his bills to people like my dad. But we need to do more to get small business started and growing – here in Broward County, throughout South Florida, across the state, and beyond.So as we grow the economy, we also have to make it fairer. I want prosperity to reach everyone, not just the privileged few. So we are going to raise the minimum wage be-cause if you work full-time, you should not still be in poverty. And you know, two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, most of them supporting kids. And if you work full-time on a minimum wage job, at the end of the year you've made $15,000. I think we can do better. And I think we should because we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead and go as far as their hard work and talent will take them. Something else we're going to do is we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women's work. Now, this is not, my friends, just a women's issue. If you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, who is working, it's your issue, too, to make sure she is paid fairly. That will raise family incomes.And then the third thing I want to do is to make sure – to make sure – more companies share profits with the workers who helped to create those profits in the first place. The other night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. He was sitting in the front row. And one of the reasons I was proud to have him there is he believes in profit-sharing. He's always, in his companies, shared profits. And by the way, he is a real billionaire. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits from the sale and 300 people who worked for him, who helped to make him a success, became millionaires. I want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that, not somebody who stiffs contractors, who doesn't pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else, but somebody who has the right attitude, that we're stronger together in business just like we are in government and America.And the other thing we have to do more of is to make sure that we help deal with some of the stresses that American families are facing. It is hard to balance family and work, isn't it? I think we can do better. I want to see us have paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare, and affordable college that includes tuition-free and debt-free college. Now, after the primary was over – and Senator Sanders and I ran a tough primary, but you know what? I was really proud. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. He and I got together and we said, okay, what are we going to do to make sure that more young people can actually get a college education? Because right now, it's way beyond what a lot of families can afford. And if you go into debt, you come out of it with so much debt that remains a burden on you.So the other day Senator Sanders and I were up in New Hampshire together, and we were rolling out our plan. And it's pretty simple. You can go to my website, but let me just tell you briefly. If you are in a family that makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university. And if you make more than that, you will pay what you can afford, but you will not have to borrow money because it will be debt-free for you to go. And we put together a calculator on my website. You can go to hillaryclinton.com/ calculator and you can see how much you will save, how much your child or your grandchild would save under this plan.But I also believe a four-year college degree, which is an important part of getting an education to get ahead, should not leave you mired in debt. So we are going to help you refinance your debt, get the interest rates down, and if you're willing to do public service, national service, we're going to forgive your debt over time. But not everyone has to go for a four-year degree. I want every person, not just young people but people who are looking for a different opportunity or may have to retrain – I want to everybody to have a chance for a good, solid job. I think we made a mistake when we took vocational education out of high school. We need to put technical education back into high school.And we need to make sure that community colleges are free so that young people starting in high school can take courses at community college to get the training they need for a good job. And I want to see business and labor unions working together for real apprenticeship programs – not the kind that lead to being told, 'You're fired,' the kind that lead to being told, 'You're hired.' Now, I'm excited about this. I really am. I am confident and optimistic about our country. We never get anything done if all we do is get down in the mouth and feel bad and complain and try to blame somebody for something else. That's not who we are as Americans. We need to lift ourselves up, and we need to roll up our sleeves to get to work to make sure that future is what it should be for our country.And while we're doing that, we're going to make sure that our country's safe and that America provides strong and steady leadership around the world. Sometimes, when I listen to my opponent, it kind of seems he doesn't know who our friends are versus our adversaries. He has this weird fascination with dictators. He's kind of signed up for the Vladimir Putin wish list. He doesn't care whether NATO falls apart, and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons. He said he doesn't care. Let Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia, get a nuclear weapon. Whoa! That's the kind of dangerous, reckless talk that people around the world pay attention to.As I told him in the debate – he actually said, 'Well, we may or may not defend our allies in Asia.' Words matter. And America's word matters. We have to be reliable and trustworthy. People have to count on us. And we've got a lot of work to do around the world. We need to work hard for peace and prosperity. We need to tackle climate change together. Climate change is real. Florida knows that. My opponent thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese. And what that means is he would not be able to take advantage of the economic opportunities that climate change presents. You see, some country's going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st Century. I think it's going to be either China, Germany, or us. I want it to be us, and it can be us if we make up our minds for that to happen. Let's deploy a half a billion more solar panels. Let's produce enough clean energy so that every home in America can be powered by it. There's so much we can do together. And that means we've got to work with other countries and we've got to demonstrate that we support our allies, whether they're in Europe, the Middle East with Israel, or Asia, that we stand with those who stand with us.And then, finally, one of the next priorities that I have if I am so fortunate enough as to be your president is to bring our country together. I've got to tell you, look, disagreements, political disagreements, that's fine. That's who we are. I don't know any two people in America who agree on everything politically with each other. And I've known, been fortunate enough to know, a number of our more recent presidents. I didn't always agree with them either, including my husband. But I'll tell you this: Republicans and Democrats alike, I never doubt they were trying to put the country's interests first. They were trying to bring people together, not pit us against each other. And one of the things I will do from the very beginning, the very first day of my administration...""Audience Member: ""Day one.""Clinton: ""...is to make them day one – you're right – is to make sure everybody in the country knows I'm the president of every American, every single per-son.Now – so in order for me to do any of this, anything that's in this book and making sure that it's paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have to pay their fair share finally, all of that, depends upon whether we win in November. The stakes could not be higher. So here is what I am asking all of you. How many of you know you are registered to vote? So we need to get everybody to be registered at your current address by October 11th. If you've moved, you may need to reregister. Here's how you can find out if you are registered. You can go to iwillvote.com, iwillvote.com. You put in your name. You put in your address and make sure you're registered. If you need to get registered, we have volunteers here. Right? And they will – they have – they have clipboards. We're kind of low-tech about it. They have clipboards. They can help you get registered right here and now or, as I say, you can go to iwillvote.com and check your registration. And, remember, you can vote by mail starting October 24th here in Broward. And the other thing you can do is convince everybody you know to make sure they're registered and to help them know how to vote by mail so they could get their vote in without making any fuss or inconvenience.So make no mistake. This election is going to be close. They always are. So every call you make, every door you knock on, every person you register could make the difference. So I'm asking you to go ahead and text JOIN, text JOIN, J?O?I?N, to 47246 to get involved or go to hillaryclinton.com. And you can volunteer and become involved. If we win Broward County by as big a margin as we should win it, we win Florida.And, like I say, I'm not just excited about winning an election. I'm excited about doing the work. I'm excited about listening to Americans. I'll continue to travel our country. I'll be here in Florida so much you'll get sick of me because I want to be a good partner for Florida. I mean, Florida is already suffering from climate change, and you have a governor who ordered the state government never to say the word or write the phrase. That's kind of hard to believe. So there's a lot we're going to do together: jobs, rising incomes, opportunities. And that's what gets me excited.So here's what I hope you will do. When you leave here, if somebody says, 'Where were you this afternoon?' you say, 'Oh, I went to a rally for Hillary Clinton.' If they say, 'Oh, that's great,"" get them registered. If they say, 'Oh, my gosh. How can you do that?' if they're seriously thinking about voting for my opponent, stage an intervention, really, because, remember, remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. And what we believe and what we're going to prove on November 8th is love trumps hate. Thank you all so much.""","UCSB"
"58",2016-10-02,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Little Rock AME Zion Church in Charlotte, North Carolina","""This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it!I am so [...] and so honored to be here. Thank you so much Reverend Dr. Walker. Thanks to the members of the Little Rock A.M.E. Zion. I have to confess – we were putting together the [...] Rev. Walker was [...]But he told me his church [...] 134 years ago was founded in a house on a rock and that rock has been sturdy and steady [...]I am so delighted to be here with your Congresswoman, Congresswoman Adams, who has a [...] path in the Congress, such a [...] of conviction. And my thanks also to Donna [...] for her leadership for that stirring description [...] Thank you so much.This church for all those years has been a source of strength and solace, for generations of congregants and [...] It has helped people get [...]. It has helped people deal with the sorrows that come [...] and it has [...] the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief. In here, in this magnificent house of worship, we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls. In here, we are called to confront injustice, even when the world out there fails to see it. In here, we see the world as it is, but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be.It has been 12 days since Mr. Scott was shot and killed. Twelve days since his wife Rakeiya Scott watched her husband die, and seven children lost their father. Now we don't yet know all the details about the shooting, but we do know this family and this community is in pain. And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses. But we do more than pray. As Ms. Bradford said, 'We do what each of us can do.' Not everyone can march, but everyone can talk, and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote.Too many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves. In fact, the day before Mr. Scott died, another father, Terence Crutcher, was killed in a police encounter in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And there have been many others. So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary, everyday activities. Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles, listening to music in their car with friends.And we also know -- and we must not forget -- that violence has touched the families of police officers. Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others. From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia, the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well.It's been a hard year, hasn't it? Think about how many times President Obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy, another shattered family, another distressed community. And our children are watching, and they feel it too. You've seen that right here in Charlotte. Last Monday at the city council meeting, 10-year-old Taje Gaddy said, 'I wake up every morning scared that I won't get to grow up because I am black.'A nine-year-old, Zianna Oliphant, who's here with us today, along with her brother Marquis and her family, also spoke at that city council meeting, with tears pouring down her face. And when I read what she had said, I had tears in my eyes too. She said, 'We are black people and we shouldn't have to feel like this. It's a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed, and we can't even see them anymore. It's a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.' What courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world.But can you imagine, nine years old. She should be thinking about happy adventures, dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her. Instead she's talking about graveyards. Our entire country should take a moment to really look at what's going on here, and across America, to imagine what we see on the news, and what we hear about, imagine through our children's eyes. I'm a grandmother, and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers. They have different, and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face. It makes my heart ache, when kids like Zianna, are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless. I know how I would feel. I wouldn't be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let's be honest here – they won't face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council.You know, every child deserves the same sense of security, every child deserves the same hope. They should not be facing fear, they should be learning and growing, imagining who they can be, and what their contributions to our country could be as well. We've got to take action, we've got to start now, not tomorrow, not next year, now. We know we can't solve all these problems over night, which means we don't have a moment to lose.Proverbs tells us, 'Where there is no vision, the people perish.' So let's hold on to a common vision. Let's come together to make America a place where every child, no matter who they are, where they're born or what they look like, has the chance to live up to their God-given potential.Being stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other. We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists, not just in police departments but throughout our country, without vilifying police officers. We can call for reforms to policing, while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity.I think about an officer named Montrell Jackson. You might not have heard of him, but I want you to. He was one of the officers murdered in Baton Rouge. A few days before he died, he wrote on Facebook, he was black but he wore blue. 'In uniform,' he wrote, 'I get nasty, hateful looks. Out of uniform, some consider me a threat. These are trying times. Please don't let hate infect your heart.' And then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug, 'I got you.'Montrell Jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas. And most officers will tell you they can't do one without the other. I believe we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system, not half measures but full measures, with real follow-through. In America everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law.That starts with being honest. Being unafraid to face the facts. Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing. We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses. We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations. We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education. And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men, more than the next nine causes combined. We've got to make sure there are good jobs, equality affordable housing in every zip code in America. We need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind. I am a strong supporter of Congressman Jim Clyburn's plan to put 10 percent of our federal funds into 20 percent of the communities that have generational poverty for 30 years or more.Now, there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division. Who want to exploit people's fears, even though it means tearing our nation even further apart. They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more 'law and order.' As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn't exist. Now, of course we need safe neighborhoods, no one is against that. Of course, we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence, of course we need that. But we also need justice and dignity and equality, and we can have both. This is not an either-or question for America.I want us to commit ourselves to this common vision. That is where I will build on the work that President Obama has done. And I will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election. This is much bigger than an election. These are issues I've been fighting for since I was a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund. Going to South Carolina to try to get young teenagers, 13, 14-year-olds out of jails with adult offenders. I care deeply about this because it's not just personal to so many of us, it's about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren. I think about that every time I see my grandchildren or every time I see a bright, energetic, impressive young woman like Zianna. Come up here a minute, would you?I love your dress.You know, God loves us all, right? We are called to care for and cherish each other. It's not easy, it is not. But that is our mission and that is what we are called to do, not only as Christians but as Americans, as human beings to understand and respect each other. To fight for each other's children, each other's dignity, each other's opportunity as if they were our own. Now, make no mistake, this is not easy work. You've been doing this since Adam and Eve came here. But it is righteous work. Protecting all of God's children is America's calling. Remember what scripture also tells us: 'Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.' We will not grow weary and we will not lose heart. We will get up every single day have faith in one another and in our future and work for that better day for all of God's people. Thank you.""","UCSB"
"60",2016-10-03,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Martin Luther King, Jr., Plaza in Toledo, Ohio","""Hello, Toledo. I am – I am very happy to be here today and – I am so grateful to have this chance to talk to you about what we can do together to have the kind of economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.I want to acknowledge – we have an overflow crowd in another room, and I know they can hear us, but we're glad they're here. I want to thank your Congresswoman, Marcy Kaptur, for her leadership and her grit. I want to thank Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson. And the mayor told me there's a young man here who just won a boxing championship, Robert Easter. Where's Robert Easter? There you are, Robert Easter. Congratulations. I know Toledo is proud of you; we all are. I want to thank Kenyetta for that introduction. Do we have any other UAW members here?It's a great day to be here in Ohio for a lot of different reasons. One is I am so thrilled that LeBron James has endorsed me and joined our campaign. I know – I've gotten a lot of wonderful endorsements over the past year and a half. I'm grateful for each and every one of them. But I got to say, there's something special about this one. And it's a real honor in part because of why he chose to endorse me. Now, not everyone knows this. I mean, you all know what an amazing athlete he his – MVP, winner of championships – but he's also – LeBron is also a dedicated advocate for children. And this afternoon I'll be in Akron, where he's done so much for the kids in that community.It's a deep, personal commitment that he has that I share with him. We both believe every single child should have the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I could not be prouder to have LeBron joining our team as we head into the homestretch.Now, one thing I know – I'll just say it because I know it's for sure – I hope to be elected president, but I know here in Ohio LeBron will always be the King.I was listening to Kenyetta introduce me, and I really appreciated what she said, because Toledo is the kind of place where people work hard, look after one another, and yes, pay their taxes, right?You recognize that we all have to do our part because we are all in this together, and it matters.We believe honest work deserves honest pay. We believe everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back.It's personal for me. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker from Scranton, Pennsylvania. He went to work in the same lace mill every day for 50 years. He believed he passed it down to my dad, who passed it down to me that if he did what he was supposed to do, he'd have a good life and his kids would have an even better life. That is the American dream. That is what we believe in. That's what we've got to keep going generation after generation.And because of my grandfather's hard work, my dad made it to college. And then after serving in the Navy during World War II, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.As a young girl, I'd sometimes go to his print plant. It was a long building, no natural light, no windows, but he had these long tables where he'd roll out the fabric and then I'd watch him work with silkscreens, if you've ever seen that. He would take the silkscreen, he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, go across all the way down to the end of one table, then over to the next table, all the way back. And then if there was a second color to be added, he would do that. He sometimes let me help with the squeegee. That was my favorite part.And I know he worked really hard. He worked really hard. He believed in hard work. He passed that on to me. He provided a good middle-class life for us. So I am proud to stand with hardworking families all over Toledo, Ohio, and America, who should have the same chance that I did to share in the American Dream, which should be big enough for everybody.Fighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life, as Kenyetta said, when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago. And it will be the mission of my presidency, because I want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues, the ones that keep you up at night – like the cost of child care, and college, and prescription drugs, and so much else.And that means we've got to create more good jobs with rising incomes. That means we've got to have good schools in every zip code. That means everybody willing to work – and I say that very clearly; you've got to be willing to work – and if you're willing to work, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. That is the basic bargain.Now, I don't know about you, but you wouldn't think that the theme of my campaign, 'getting an economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top' would be controversial – and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time.Now, I will say, most American companies – most – are run by honorable, patriotic people who care about their employees and communities. But there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else. [Applause.] And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers, workers, small businesses, and taxpayers.That makes it tougher for the well-meaning CEOs to take the high road. And it gets even harder when we don't aggressively enforce the rules, when we don't enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up, when we don't enforce rules on Wall Street, which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value, investing in workers, plant, and equipment over the longer term.And let's be honest, the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the United States. And it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse. It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that can't afford lawyers and lobbyists.So with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction, it's even more important that we have an election about these very issues. Because what I know will happen – if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field, we will rebuild the middle class, we will make work pay, we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of Americans.Now, I know how hard this, but I think we are on the cusp, if we win this election, to be able to get these things done, right?""Audience: ""Yeah.""Clinton: ""That means pursuing reforms that unleash the enormous positive potential of the American private sector. We've got unmatched talent, innovation, entrepreneurial spirit.So when we work together, we can all benefit.Now, I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders – but to their workers, to their customers, to their communities, and yes, to our country, to the United States of America. We have been moving off track for decades. I don't need to tell you that. You know it, you've lived it, you've seen it. But it is time to get back on track.And you can ask anybody who's ever worked for me or worked with me, who's ever served with me, when I tell you I'm going to try to do something, I will get up every single day and work my heart out for you.So let's begin by making it clear that for most businesses, America is the most important asset on their balance sheet. This country of ours, this system of ours, the rule of law, the opportunity to get an education and go as far as your hard work and ambition will take you. And we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world, the American middle class. So when we middle class thrives, the country thrives. And when it doesn't, we don't, right?And I'm going to use the White House and every tool at my disposal as your president to make the case that patriotism is profitable. Standing up for America, investing in America will pay off.Now, we have always had innovators and entrepreneurs who build great companies and create real value. But we should not and we will not respect those who get rich by cheating everybody else.So today I want to send a clear message to every boardroom, every executive suite across America: If you scam your customers, exploit your employees, pollute our environment, or rip off taxpayers, we will find ways to hold you accountable.But on the other side – on the other side, if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our country's future, we will stand with you. That is the choice. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better.Now, to understand why this is so important, consider the recent examples we've seen of egregious corporate behavior.Look at Wells Fargo. Really shocking, isn't it? One of the nation's biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing personal information, and then sticking customers with hidden fees. It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy, we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law.And then in a category by himself, there's Donald Trump. Well, you may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades. You can look at 40 years of my tax returns. I think we need a law that says if you become the nominee of the major parties, you have to release your tax returns.Now, a lot of us were wondering, what is he hiding? It must be really terrible. Well, The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer. Back in the 1990s, Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos. Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is kind of beyond me. It's just hard to figure. But as a result, it doesn't look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades.Now, while millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. Imagine that. Not fair. Nothing for Pell Grants to help kids go to college. Nothing for veterans. Nothing for our military. And you know, he has been dissing America in this whole campaign. Right? He talks us down. He makes disparaging comments about our country. He calls our military a disaster. Well, it's not, but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform.I saw a newspaper article. A gentleman named Steve Crouse, who owns the Glass City Cafй here in Toledo, summed it up pretty well in this article. He said, 'I would feel guilty if I didn't pay anything. It's flat-out cheating the government.' Now, my friend Bernie Sanders was right yesterday when he said Trump reflects a distorted view of the American people and what this country is all about.Trump represents the same rigged system that he claims he's going to change. The whole story tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business. After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn't lift a finger to help and protect his employees, or all the small businesses and contractors he'd hired, or the people of Atlantic City. They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire. And all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies. In other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill.Now, he says that he's the one who can fix things, but that is like letting the fox guard the henhouse. Right? And here's what I really am just stunned by. I get stunned every day in this campaign. But here's one of the many things that I'm stunned by. He has put forth a tax plan that would cut his own taxes even more. It would be like you're paying zero. You expect us to pay you to stay in business, all the rest of us in America? He'd open the loopholes even wider. And according to a new independent study, he would actually – listen to this, people, because this is a real shocker – his plan would actually raise taxes for millions of middle class families. And you know the people it would hit the hardest? Are single parents, whose lives and challenges he doesn't care about, certainly doesn't understand.Now, many have likely already spent years paying more than he did, and he now would make that even worse. And what does he say about it? Well, did you all see the debate last Monday? Well, in the debate – in the debate – well, then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes. Yesterday his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius. Here's my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?This is Trump to a T. He's taken corporate excess and makes a business model out of it. He abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country's. It's Trump first and everyone else last. And there are lots of principled, law-abiding business leaders out there who are horrified by all of this. Not a single – not a single CEO of a Fortune 100 company supports Trump's campaign. Think about it. I've been endorsed by very successful people – Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Mark Cuban. I loved what Mark Cuban said when he endorsed me. He said, 'Look, I've been successful.' He actually is a real billionaire. And you know what? He used profit-sharing to help his employees, not bankruptcy to fire people. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits with his employees, and 300 of them became millionaires. That's the kind of business practices I want to see more of in our country.But here's what we've got to do. Even if Trump is like one of a kind, we've got to reverse the broader trends he represents. It's time to rewrite the rules and make this economy fair for everyone. And today I want to briefly share with you my plan for protecting taxpayers, consumers, small businesses, and workers. We're going to crack down on the worst corporate abuses and empower companies willing to take the high road and invest in good jobs, in higher wages, and in stronger communities.First let's start with protecting taxpayers and making sure we have more fairness in the system. It is wrong that corporations and the super-wealthy play by a different set of rules. A Wall Street money manager should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse. And I'll tell you something else. Our largest companies should not be able to get away with paying hardly anything at all. It is insulting when they engage in these games, like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country – on paper, not in reality – just to take advantage of lower tax rates. And it is infuriating when they take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips in America with the other hand. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to close those loopholes. I've got a list of them we're going after. We're going to make Wall Street corporations and the super-rich start paying their fair share of taxes. We're going to pass something called the Buffett rule, which means multimillionaires cannot lower rates than their secretaries and other people working for them. We're going to put in place a new exit tax. If companies try to leave our country to avoid paying their fair share, if they try to outsource jobs, they're going to have to give back every tax break they ever received in our country. And then we're going to put that money to work creating opportunities here in America.Second, we're going to protect consumers. No American should ever be taken advantage of, like thousands were, by Wells Fargo. And this isn't a new fight for me. As a Senator, I raised the alarm about subprime mortgages. I fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids. I introduced legislation to protect Americans' personal data and combat identity theft. So as president, I will make consumer protection a top priority across the entire government.And that starts by defending and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau, which was created after the financial crisis. And the principal person who got it created was Senator Elizabeth Warren. And under the leadership of Ohio's Rich Cordray, the agency has already returned more than $11 billion to more than 15 million Americans who were ripped off by predatory lenders, credit card companies, and others. And it is the one making sure that the defrauded Wells Fargo customers get their money back.Now, I got to say I am so proud of what this new agency has done. Sometimes people say, well, what does the government really do? Well, there's a lot of examples, but this is a primary one, standing up and making sure consumers get paid back when they are ripped off. And because of its success, Republicans in Congress keep trying to shut it down. And Donald Trump agrees with them. In fact, he wants to scrap all the tough new rules imposed on Wall Street after the crisis. Well, not on my watch, Donald. We're never going to let that happen.Now, instead of gutting consumer protection, we should be expanding it. And we should build on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and go even further because Wall Street can never, ever be permitted to threaten Main Street again. And the Wells Fargo scandal sheds light on another threat to consumers that we have to address. When the scam's victims, people like you and me, who had accounts there tried to sue, they were shocked to learn there was a provision in the very fine print of their contracts that kept them from going to court to sue the bank for being cheated. Instead, they are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections that you get in a court of law. We are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these fine print ""gotchas"" to escape accountability. And in fact, this is now common practice across a lot of industries – from nursing homes, nursing homes that mistreat seniors, to for-profit colleges that defraud students. Who reads all that fine print? I don't. And you get defrauded or you get mistreated, and then all of a sudden they say, 'Well, you can't sue us.' So we're going to rein in that abuse across everybody.We also see a similar problem in some international trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It sets up a dispute resolution system that favors large corporations over everyone else. It's one of the reasons I'm against it. I've warned about this for years, I've written about it, and I oppose TPP now, I will oppose it after the election, I will oppose it as president – because it is one-sided and unfair to American workers.And what about all those pharmaceutical companies that jack up prices for no reason? We're going to have to protect ourselves against that too. And when we find unjustified spikes in the prices of longstanding, life-saving drugs, we should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need those drugs.And let's finally import safe alternatives from other countries, like Canada, and speed up approvals to get more generic drugs on the market. And it is long past time to allow Medicare to negotiate for better prices for drugs and get the cost down for Medicare recipients. And I believe we should cap the amount working families pay out of pocket every month for medicine. No one should ever have to choose between paying the rent and filling their prescriptions. So let's stand up for taxpayers. Let's stand up for consumers. And let's stand up for small businesses, which create most of the jobs in America. I take this personally be-cause of my dad's very small business. We need fair rules of the road so big corporations can't use their power to gain unfair advantages.Now, when it comes to bullying small businesses, Donald Trump is the poster boy. I have heard so many stories of contractors, and I've met some too, who worked for him, produced the goods and services, and never got paid for what they were owed. I'm talking about painters, and plumbers, piano sellers, architects, glass installers – he stiffed them all. Not because he couldn't pay them, but he wouldn't pay them. And he told them, 'You want to get your money? Sue me.' My dad could never have done that. I'm just grateful my dad never got a contract with Donald Trump, because I don't know what we would have done.More than 60 percent of small businesses face payment delays. That can cause a serious cash flow crisis. So as president, I will explore new ways to arm small businesses with the tools to fight back and level the playing field. Part of the problem is large corporations are amassing so much power in our economy. Sometimes it's called market concentration or even old-fashioned monopolies, but either way it threatens businesses of all sizes, as well as consumers. With less competition, corporations can use their power to raise prices, limit choice for consumers, cut wages for workers, crowd out startups and small businesses.I mean, look what's happening right now. In most of the country, the three largest health insurance companies in each state control 80 percent of the market. No wonder premiums are going up. As president, I will appoint tough, independent authorities to strengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions, so the big don't keep getting bigger and bigger.I want every business to compete and thrive, and then I also want to do something else. Let's protect and empower workers who actually drive our economy. Everyone who works hard should be able to share in the rewards, not just senior executives. So we're proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to share profits, on top of, not instead of, higher wages.We need to support new organizing strategies for employees who too often have never had the benefit of collective bargaining. And we have to resist the assault on workers' rights. Let's say loudly and clearly: 'right to work' is wrong for workers and wrong for America.Let's also, my friends, let's raise the minimum wage and support the Fight for 15 so you don't live in poverty. Let's defend overtime and go after wage theft. Let's provide family leave that is paid and access to affordable, high-quality childcare. And of course you know what I'm going to say: let's finally guarantee equal pay for women.Now, my opponent and his chief surrogates like to say I'm playing the woman's card. And I'll tell you – right? – if fighting for working families is playing the women's card, you know what? Deal me in!And then finally, I've got a lot on my mind, but finally, we need to make it easier for companies to invest in good jobs here at home. As president, I will ramp up enforcement of trade rules by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor and tripling the number of enforcement officers. We will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. I want to direct $10 billion to create a 'Make It in America' partnership to support American manufacturing. And I want to take some of the ideas that worked when my husband was President and we ended up with 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.That includes incentives like the New Markets Tax Credit for creating good jobs in poor or remote areas, from inner cities to rural communities ravaged – ravaged – by hollowed-out factories, ravaged by mines that have been shut down, ravaged by opiate addiction. It all comes down to this: When I say our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top, I mean it. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure workers are treated like assets, not costs. And we're going to bring back infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean, renewable energy jobs, innovation, technology, small business. Now, you don't have to look any further than right here in Northwest Ohio. Just a few years ago, as you heard Kenyetta say, in 2009 you were in the eye of the storm. Jobs, homes, savings, wiped out. The auto industry on the verge of collapse. A lot of people were ready to give up on it. Well, that would have meant giving up on 850,000 people across this state whose jobs were tied to the industry. Donald Trump, for one, said rescuing the auto industry didn't matter very much. Either way would have been acceptable, he said. 'We could have just let it go,' and that's a direct quote from him. Everybody in Ohio who's thinking about voting for Trump needs to hear that. At the time of the worst financial crisis in Ohio in 2009, he would have let you twist and fall. And for his running mate he picked Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of the auto rescue. Well, thank goodness the people of Northwest Ohio weren't ready to let it go. You never gave up. You didn't lose faith. And now, after a lot of hard work and sacrifice, the auto industry just had its best year ever.But that's not all there is to the story because in addition to that hard work, America, America, came to the rescue. Taxpayers like all of us, not him but us, provided the funds for the rescue. Union workers stepped up. Communities like Toledo came together to make it work. And now that the industry's back on its feet, the auto companies have a responsibility to give back. So I was delighted to hear that Chrysler is doubling down on Toledo, investing $700 million here to start building the next generation Jeep Wrangler, which could create about 700 new good jobs. And tens of thousands of UAW workers at Chrysler plants should see a big increase in profit-sharing payments above and beyond wages and benefits. Now, that's the way it's supposed to work, when we all help each other out. When we stand together, we are stronger together.So what I want you to know is if you join me in this campaign, I will always stand up and fight for you and fight for your jobs and fight for your families. And I guess we have about 36 days left. The election's going to be close. Every call you make, every door you knock, every friend you register to vote, could make the difference. You can text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now or go to hillaryclinton.com to sign up and volunteer. Here in Ohio you have until October the 11th to register to vote. And there are people with clipboards around, and you can go actually register today on your way out the door.So we have just over a week to register, and then early voting starts October 12th. Let's prove – let's prove – that the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. Let's prove that we're going to stand together, make the smart decisions that we get the economy going and growing for everybody, not just those at the top; that we will stand up against special privilege and special interest; that we will be ready after this election to have an agenda that will really make a difference here in Toledo and across Ohio. So I'm here asking for your help, asking for your work, asking for you to be part of this campaign, and then when we win on November 8, be part of changing our country for the better! Thank you all and God bless you!""","UCSB"
"61",2016-10-10,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Ohio State University in Columbus","""It is a glorious night here at the university, in Columbus, in the great state of Ohio. And I am thrilled to be here with all of you. And I want to thank Tony for his introduction. He made the greatest case against my opponent, didn't he? Thank you, Tony. And thanks to Mayor Ginther and Congresswoman Beatty and to my great friend, your former governor, and with your help, the next senator, Ted Strickland.Any of you see that debate last night? I'll tell you what, I'm not sure you'll ever see anything like that again. At least I hope you won't. It was such a clear display of what's at stake in this election. And I am thrilled to have the chance to talk with all of you about what we can do together, because I truly believe we are stronger together. To move our country forward.Now, the one thing I thought about last night and said was, as I was standing there on the stage with my opponent, was to remember what Michelle Obama had said. To paraphrase her, one of us went low and one of us went high. I want you to understand, I want to be a president for all Americans. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody. And I am honored to have support, not just from Democrats, but from independents and Republicans, because we've got to pull this country together if we're going to move into the future together, creating what we need for ourselves and our children.Now, I got to tell you, tomorrow is a big day in Ohio for this election because tomorrow, October 11th, is the last day to register in Ohio. And I hope every one of you will take your phones out, go to iwillvote.com, to confirm that you are registered. Because we want everybody to vote and we particularly want young people to vote because this is your election more than anybody else's.When I think about the challenges that we're facing, I don't think any one person has all the answers. I think we have to listen to each other and respect each other and celebrate our diversity, because that makes us smarter as well as stronger.Donald Trump spent his time last night attacking me when he should have been apologizing. We all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women. And last night he doubled down on his excuse, saying that, well, it's just locker room banter. You know what's happened today, which is so interesting, is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the NBA, from Major League Baseball, from the NFL and more, have been coming forward, tweeting, they've been saying, no, that's not what happens in our locker rooms. And I just happen to think that our athletes and our coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than Donald Trump does.But it wasn't just this one video that was so disturbing, even shocking. We have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign, and it's not just about women. Yes, he's insulted and demeaned women; we've seen it over and over again. But he has targeted others as well. He's disrespected and denigrated African Americans and Latinos, Muslims and POWs, people with disabilities and immigrants. He is an equal-opportunity insulter if there ever was one.That is not what we are in America. And it may be who he is, but this election is our chance to show who we are. We are better than that. We are bigger than that. And I want to send a message to every boy and girl, every man and woman in our country, indeed, to the entire world, that that is not who America is. And we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever. Some analysts are saying we may have the biggest presidential election than we've had in a really long time. And the main reason is because your generation, the young people of America, are the most tolerant, open and generous generation in American history. You know what's at stake, but you also know what you believe. And you don't want someone who says that he's going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will reverse marriage equality; who will – who will keep Citizens United, one of the worst decisions ever made, that allowed dark, unaccountable money in our electoral system; that will reverse a woman's right to make her own health care decisions; who will defund Planned Parenthood. You know better than that. You are helping us move toward a more perfect union. That has been the story of America at our best. We keep widening the circle of opportunity and inviting more people in. If you're willing to do your part, you're willing to make your contribution, there is a place for you in this nation of ours.We don't have to make America great. We've got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity.And please, never forget America is great because America is good, and if we deviate, if we deviate from our fundamental values – and that's indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run. He has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes. He has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country – a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty. This is turning the clock back, not just a few years, but centuries. The only way to rebuke this is to vote. Use the single most important, fundamental right you have as citizens of America.And when you do, I want you to know what you're voting for, because I don't want you just to vote against something. I want you to vote for something. And here's what we're going to do.I believe our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top. So I am ending this campaign the way I started my career all those years ago when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. As soon as I got out of law school, I said, I don't want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families. So I was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change, helping to get the law that enabled people, kids with disabilities, to go to school. Now, most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you weren't born, but – there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability, if you lived in a school district, there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you. And literally millions of kids were denied an education. I went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that I could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the Congress and say, this is wrong – in America, we're better than this. Open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities.And then I was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place. So when Donald Trump talks about what I've been doing for the last 30 years, I welcome that. I welcome it because in the 1970s, I was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments. And in the 1980s, I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future, while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business. And in the 1990s, I went to the UN Conference on Women and said women's rights are human rights – while he was insulting Miss Universe, Alicia Machado. And on the day – on the day that I was in the Situation Room watching the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice. So if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years, bring it on. So we've got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want. And I'm pretty clear about that. I think we want new jobs with rising incomes. And I want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of World War II. And I have some specific ideas in mind. We are going to have a big investment in infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. They need to be upgraded and maintained and built. That is a question of competitiveness. We have to have a competitive economy. Our airports are so rundown we don't even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because we're not using the newest technology. We're not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs.I do want to bring advanced manufacturing. I heard Ted Strickland talking about that. I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance. There is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing. I'm not interested in a race to the bottom, in competing for low-wage jobs. I am interested in competing for the high-wage jobs. So let's lead in precision machining, 3D printing. And let's be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Some nation's going to have that title. I think it's either going to be Germany or China or us. It should be us. No question it should be. We're going to fight climate change. And we're going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement.I'm running against somebody who doesn't believe in climate change or at least he says he doesn't , who has even said he thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese. Well, right now the Chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do. So maybe they think it's a hoax, but they're investing. And they're creating. And they're going to want to export. And what a shame it would be. We have innovated. We have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this. And we're going to do it.When I am president, I want all of you who care about science, technology, engineering, mathematics, I want you to be part of it. And while we are growing the economy, we are going to make it fairer. We are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should be left in poverty. And don't you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work? You know, back in the spring, I was at a town hall in Las Vegas. And the little girl raised her hand. And I called on her. And she said to me, 'If you're elected president, does a girl president make the same as a boy president?'I said, ""Well, that's one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make."" So we're going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly.And I'll tell you something else. I want to do more to promote profit-sharing. If you help to make the profits, it shouldn't all just go to the executives and the shareholders. You should be able to share in that.Now, there's a lot we can do. And people say, 'Well, how are you going to pay for it?' Well, I'm going to go where the money is. And all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country. I have made a pledge, and you can hold me to it. I will not raise taxes on the middle class. Nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share.Now, Donald Trump is the poster child for this. Last night he finally admitted he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years. Now, he claims that's because back in the early 1990s, he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who loses money running casinos? Really. Now, one of his supporters said, 'Well, the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didn't have to pay taxes made him a genius.' Well, I guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year. But I'll tell you what. What that meant was he paid zero, zero for the military, zero for our vets, zero for Pell Grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college.And then he did something that, in retrospect, seemed both odd and not very smart. He brought in Warren Buffett. He said, 'Well, everybody does this. Warren Buffett does this.'So Warren Buffett, who, by the way, is a real billionaire, Warren Buffett, heard that, pretty hard to miss. And so he put out a statement today. And here's what he said. He said, 'I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13.' He said, 'I have copies of all 72 of my returns. And none uses a carryforward.' That was the gimmick Trump used to avoid paying his fair share. And then Warren Buffett ends by saying, 'Finally, I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit.' 'Neither would Mr. Trump. At least he would have no legal problem in doing so.' Well, if you take a shot at Warren Buffett, you'd better be prepared. And in fact, Warren Buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more. He says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him. And he has proposed what's called the Buffett rule, and I am absolutely behind that, and I've said that's one of the changes I want – so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share.Now, there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe. And so, don't. But one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer. You know, he's not usually tongue-tied, but he had no answer when confronted about the report that he's been buying cheap Chinese steel for his construction projects instead of American-made steel that supports good American jobs. Now, I know you've seen reports and you've probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies. He's had a lot of them across Ohio. He claims to be on the side of workers. He especially likes to talk about how he supports American steelworkers. He even had the nerve – this is what kills me about him – he even had the nerve to brag about how American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. And the whole time he was hiding the truth. Hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegally-dumped Chinese steel instead of American steel. You know, when China illegally floods our market with steel at below-price, and people like Trump buy it, that kills jobs. It kills jobs in this state, including right here in Columbus. This May, Columbus Castings, the biggest single-site foundry in America, just seven miles from where we are tonight, filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off. Now, when I think of that and I think of the way Trump has been playing people, it really – it really gets me upset. There's no justification for it. But it fits him to a T. For all his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump's suits and ties were made in Mexico and China. They could have been made right here in Ohio. In fact, he could have made his ties three miles from the Trump Tower in New York.So we've got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing. And that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country, investment in workers, investment in plant and equipment, investment in research and development, and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by Wall Street and others. We are going to end the cowboy culture on Wall Street and what happens in too many boardrooms. We're going to defend the tough new rules on Wall Street that President Obama got passed, the Dodd-Frank rules. Trump wants to do away with those. He also wants to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, something that was designed and created by my friend Senator Elizabeth Warren to protect consumers. He wants to do away with that. And yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class.Well, we're going to crack down on corporate fraud, like we've seen at Wells Fargo. We're going to crack down to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again. And we're going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave America. If they try to leave, we're going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in America.We're also going to end the carried interest loophole. I've been trying to get that done for years. We're going to get it done. We've got a couple of different ways of doing it. I hope that Congress along with us, but if they don't, we're going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code, hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate, not for investing but just for moving money around. That's going to end. I want to reward the productive economy. I don't want to keep rewarding the financial economy. That is not the way we're going to grow new businesses, and create new opportunities and more jobs for Americans.Now, people in Ohio often ask about, 'Well, what are we going to do about trade?' Well, we're going to have smart and fair trade. That's what I love about your Senator, Sherrod Brown. He is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have. Look. We've got to trade with the rest of the world. We're only 5 percent of the population of the world. We've got to trade with the other 95 percent. When I was Secretary of State, we really bore down on this, and we increased American exports 30 percent, and in particular, 50 percent to China, because we stood behind every American business. We helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell.And I've gone toe-to-toe with the Chinese over trade. They have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent American companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal. So we're going to stand up. I'm going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal we're already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us.And I've always had three tests for trade deals: Does it create American jobs? Does it raise American incomes? is it good for our national security? And when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP, it fails my tests. Once it was finally negotiated, I don't think it will do what I want it to do, so I oppose it. I oppose TPP now. I'll oppose it after the election. I'll oppose it as president. But I'm going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world. I also saw a sign or a t-shirt out here about Social Security. And that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about, but I'll tell you what. I am never going to let anybody privatize Social Security. That is off the table forever.So let's say yes to good jobs, but here's what else we need to say yes to. Let's say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university. I want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well. And for a lot of kids, they're not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade. There's an achievement gap already. There's also a digital gap; we have five million homes, mostly poor homes, without access to the internet, so they're behind. I want this to be a true meritocracy. I'm tired of inequality. I want people to feel like they can get ahead if they work for it. So I want to have universal pre-kindergarten so every child can be prepared to be successful. I want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education. And I think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school. We need technical education for more young people. Not everybody needs to or wants to go to a four-year college, but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful. I want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses. We have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers, for coders, for all kinds of skills.And then when it comes to college, I want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what I am proposing that is a joint proposal from Senator Sanders and myself. We both remember that college was affordable. And it isn't for a lot of people now, and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities. So here is our proposal.We want anyone from a family that makes less than $125,000 a year to go to Ohio State University tuition-free. And for families over that line, we want you to go debt-free. So yes, you pay what you can afford, but you don't have to go into debt to go to Ohio State. And I'll tell you, the other big problem – how many of you already have student debt? Oh, wow. Practically every hand. Well, here's what we're going to do. We're going to make it possible for you to refinance that debt. If you can refinance your home mortgage, your car payment, or if Donald can refinance his airplane, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt. And then we want you to pay it back as a percentage of the income you make, and have a limit on that, 10 percent, so that – I feel personally about this because that's what I did after law school. My dad was a small businessman, and he really was a saver. He didn't even have a credit card. Didn't believe in that. So he saved the money for me to go to college. I had to work if I wanted to buy a book, but that was okay. That was the arrangement. And then I told him I wanted to go to law school. He said, 'You're on your own. I don't have any money for that.' So I worked, I got a small scholarship, and I took out loans. But boy, was I lucky, because I got into one of the earliest income repayment programs. In other words, when I got out of law school, I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund and make, I don't know, $14,000 a year because I could pay it back as a percentage of my income, not on an interest rate of 8, 10, 12 percent like I see from young people across America.So that's what I want, but I also want to make it possible, if you do public service or national service, to have a lot of your loan, and maybe all of it, forgiven because you're going to be paying back to our country. And I've got this idea about something I'm calling the National Service Reserve. It's kind of like if any of you have ever been in the military reserve. You get the training and you're kind of on call and you practice and train. And then if you're needed, you're called up. I want a civilian national reserve, and I want people of all ages in it. And we would train you so that if there's a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with, we could call you up to go do that. And it's a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because that's how we build solidarity. That's how we get to know each other better. So I'm pretty excited about what we're going to do together. And I can't do any of this without your help. I really am asking you to do everything you can to make sure you're registered, to tell your friends and anybody else you can talk to make sure they're registered. As I said, go to iwillvote.com. You can find it out right there on that site. And we'd love to have you be involved in the campaign because I know that if we win in November, we can summon the positive spirit of our country back again. I think I have to do everything, everything in my power to bring people together, and I will.It's really important to me that you know that I want to be your president whether you vote for me or not. Obviously, I hope you do, but I will be your president, and I will stand up for you, and I will work for you, and I will fight for you. So please, if you're not registered, get registered by tomorrow, and then you can start voting October 12th. And whatever issue, whatever issue you care about, imagine that that is on the ballot. Imagine if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, if you believe – if you believe that we finally should have paid family leave in this country like every other advanced economy, if you believe climate change is real and we could save our planet by creating a lot of jobs at the same time, if you believe diversity is America's strength, not a weakness, if you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that LGBT Americans should be treated equally across America, and you should be able to live up to your potential, no matter who you are or where you come from, then start voting October the 12th!And I promise you this. Together we're going to prove that we can make the future what it should be for all of you; that there is a positive, optimistic, confident America out there; that America's best days are ahead of us, not the dark and divisive vision of my opponent, but one in keeping with what I see as I travel across America – the energy, the dynamism, the entrepreneurial spirit of all Americans, but particularly young Americans. So please, join this campaign. Be part of it for the next 29 days. And together we will prove that we can have the future that we want and that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you, Ohio State!""","UCSB"
"62",2016-10-11,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the Kendall Campus of Miami Dade College in Miami, Florida","""Hello, Miami Dade College! It is so great to be here with all of you.And I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular, I want to thank all of the elected officials. Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida. Thanks to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Thank you to Mayor Phillip Levine of Miami Beach. Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami. Thanks to all the others who were part of the program. As we were coming in, we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd, and I was told as I was coming out, there's an overflow, but they can hear us in the overflow, and we're so happy you're here as well! So thanks to the overflow crowd. But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the world's most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore.About a decade ago, Al made a movie called 'An Inconvenient Truth.' Now, maybe some of you have seen it, but if you haven't, I hope you'll watch it tonight. It doesn't have a lot of special effects – but it does have a lot of drama.And here's the main message: climate change is real, it's urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it. Right? We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions. We can transform our economy. We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution. And above all, we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren.Now, let me just say – so, so let's remember, let's remember what's at stake. I'm running against a guy who denies science, denies climate change, claims it's a hoax created by the Chinese. So this is something that Al Gore's been working on for a really long time. And I want you to know how far back he goes. It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen. And then when Al became a senator, he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions, and as vice president, he led America's efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions. You take all this together, those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.I was very proud because he had been determined and persistent, and in the face of a lot of people – in public life, in business, in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science – he never wavered. And in the years since, the climate challenge has only grown more stark. And I will tell you this, it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election.Look at it this way. Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change, to protect our planet, to protect our health, and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy. Or in the alternative, we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk.So we've really got to get this right. And if you need additional convincing, just remember what happened this week. Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country, more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti. North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week, if not longer. We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster.That's why I've encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon, the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew, or to UNICEF, helping children and families on the ground in Haiti.Now, some will say, 'We've always had hurricanes. They've always been destructive.' And that's true. But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change. Right now, the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures – and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas. Sea levels have already risen about a foot – one foot – in much of the Southeast, which means that Matthew's storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe.Plus, as you know, the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes. It's become a daily reality here in Miami. You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide. The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. Sometimes, people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them.So, if you need proof that climate change is real and that it's costly, there you go. So at this rate, at this rate, my friends, my friends, please. Let's focus on what's really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country, because this is what I want you to hear and understand. At the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century, and when kids – like that adorable young boy over there on his dad's shoulders – are grandparents, we believe that's more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk, and nationwide, it's as much as $882 billion in property at risk.But there's also health consequences. Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges. And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse, which is especially bad for our children. And look at what is happening in California, a brutal five-year drought. Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year.And it's also about national security. The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our America's national security. The U.S. Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk, Virginia. It's the largest naval installation in the world. And because of rising sea level, the base is frequently flooded, even when it's sunny. So that's why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations, not just in Norfolk, but at all of our military bases around the world.So you would think if you look at the facts, if you listen to the science, that even the most committed climate skeptic would say, 'Ok, I agree, something's happening here. We need to take it seriously.'But unfortunately, there are still plenty of people – in Washington, on the campaign trail – who won't face what's happening right in front of us.Donald Trump, is, quote, 'not a big believer' in climate change. As I said, he said it's a hoax created by the Chinese. And in our first debate two weeks ago, he tried to deny saying that. But that tweet is still there for everyone to see.And I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida, like Miami Beach's Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these 'Sunny Day' Floods. Or maybe, he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alemбn. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner, John Elizabeth Alemбn. John Elizabeth is a Republican, but she's supporting our campaign—because she knows America can't afford a candidate who doesn't accept climate science. Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security, or what about the ranchers in Colorado, or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say, 'Our lives and jobs and families are being affected – please, let's come together as a country and do something about it.'We cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House. At all, that is absolutely unacceptable.We need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat, creating good jobs, and yes, saving our planet.So here's what I want to do.First, we need to do a lot more on clean energy. The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany, China, or us—and I want it to be us. And I want you to be part of making it us.And we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs, building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines. Modernizing our electric grid. Retrofitting buildings. Building resilient, 21st century infrastructure, and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind—not our cities or our small towns or our remote, rural areas.Now, you wouldn't know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is. He has such a dark, divisive view of America, but that doesn't tell the story about what's really going on. It's actually pretty exciting. In red states and blue states, local leaders are stepping up. Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America – union workers in Michigan, union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy. Iowa, Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind. Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie. Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America. I think that is so exciting – there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency.And in Spartanburg, South Carolina, a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm. That landfill was a blight and a health threat, just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood. Now, that same land will generate enough clean, renewable electricity to power 500 homes.So this is what we can do. And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that. As president, I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term. And let's generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade. Let's make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third.And we can get there by investing in cutting edge research, to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies, investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing, putting big partnerships together between states, cities, and rural communities.We can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do. So I'm hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future. The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America. We want them manufactured in America, installed in America, and putting people to work in America.And while we do that, let's make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us. We need to invest in resilient infrastructure. Now, sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times, let's be more creative – like in New York Harbor, where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge. Sometimes we'll overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours. In Philadelphia, they're trying something else: green roofs, porous pavements, curbside gardens to help absorb storm water.And here's something we don't talk enough about. Let's make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster. Because sadly, I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy, newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital, because the electricity went off. Nurses, I love nurses – heroic, courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing. Now, here in Miami, you know how important this is. You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Children's Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason. And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience.And then finally, we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge. If we don't do it, nobody will do it. We must confront the climate challenge. There's no doubt about that. And so, let's move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves.When I was Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority. We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution. In fact, we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark – slip past the guards – it was all very cloak and dagger. But for a really important purpose, and because of that breakthrough, and a lot of patient, persistent work, and because of American leadership, 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December. It's called the Paris Agreement. And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last, best chance to solve the global, climate crisis.And what does Donald Trump want to do? He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement. He doesn't care what it would do to the planet. He doesn't care how much that would damage American leadership in the world. He doesn't care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids.Well, he may not care – but we do. And that's why this election is so critically important because on the ballot, it is not just my name. It's every issue we care about it's our values as a country.Climate change needs to be a voting issue. We need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done. Please, we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state houses—and certainly not to the White House.And if you care about climate, your Senate race is also really important, and I'll tell you why. It is unacceptable, it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio, when asked about climate change to say, 'I'm not a scientist.' Well, why doesn't he ask a scientist and then maybe then he'd understand why it is so important that he, representing Florida, be committed to climate change? That's why I hope that you'll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate.Look, we need leaders who can get results. It's easy to stonewall. It's not enough to protest: we need creativity, we need hard work. And when it comes to climate change, we don't have a minute to waste.So, I know it's easy to get cynical—especially about our politics. I get that. But this election matters more than any has in a really long time, and I believe that as strongly as I can, we've got to address this issue for our sakes, our children, our grandchildren. And it's so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference.And just look, if you will – look at the difference between your state, the Sunshine State, which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now. And do you know why? Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words 'climate change.' So my friends, this is a big deal in the election, and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world. And there isn't anybody – there isn't anybody who knows more, has done more, has worked harder. I know he was in Miami just last year, training and educating people to be climate change activists. I can't wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States. So please join me in welcoming our former vice president, a climate change leader and an all-around great guy, Al Gore.""","UCSB"
"63",2016-10-12,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the Palace of Agriculture at the Colorado State Fairgrounds in Pueblo","""Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Wow.Audience: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!Thank you so very, very much. Wow. I am so happy to be back here and to be here with all of you. I am thrilled. And I can't thank you enough.And it's a special privilege and pleasure to be introduced by my friend and such a great leader, someone who has served not only this state so well, but also our country. And so I want to thank -- once again, I want to thank former senator and former secretary, Ken Salazar. And I also want to thank somebody else who's here who is really special and is doing such a great job for all of you. And that is your senator, and I hope you will get out and send him back to Washington, Michael Bennet.I also want to recognize someone who's running a great race for congress, Gail Schwartz.I -- I was thinking -- I was thinking, the first time I came to this beautiful place and had a chance to meet people from here was in 1992.I was here for somebody else, namely my husband who was running for president.And I know there are a lot of really young people here, but was anybody here back in 1992?Well, Bill and I talk about Pueblo all the time. And it is always a treat for either one of us to come. And today, it's especially important because we are getting closer and closer and closer to the next election. And we're also very conscious of the fact that here in Colorado for the first time, you are all going to be able to vote by mail.And this Monday, October 17th, ballots will start being mailed to Colorado voters.Now, if you've already registered to vote, I hope you'll keep your eye open for the mail and fill out your ballot. Send it back as quick as you can. Don't wait to fill it out.Don't do what I do, put it on the kitchen counter and then you put something else on top of it and something else and pretty soon you're wondering, ""Where is that ballot? I know it cam here a few days ago."" So please put it in the mail so we can get every early vote counted quickly and avoid a big backlog on election night.And maybe -- if you haven't registered to vote yet, please do it right now. And if you go to Iwillvote.com, you can do that on your phones -- you do that right now -- you can get registered. Pretty easy, huh?Because we need everybody to vote in this election. And we need your friends and your family and everyone you can reach, because this is about something so important. I don't know that there's ever been a more serious or consequential election. And we can see that people feel that way, because across America, people are already voting in high numbers.A lot of states have what's called early vote, and the numbers are bigger than anybody thought. And bigger than they've been in the past.Just this morning in Ohio, people began lining up last night so they could be sure to vote. They couldn't wait to cast their ballots. And by the time we're done, we expect record numbers of people to vote in this presidential election.So don't be left out because we need you. And oh by the way, if you've got friends in Utah or Arizona make sure they vote too. We are competing everywhere and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want to turn out as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent.And you know, your vote can make all the difference. I was in Florida yesterday with former Vice President Gore.And as he said yesterday, take it from him, every vote counts. So don't sit this one out. And I'm very proud of the campaign we've run. I'm proud of the campaign Bernie Sanders and I ran.It was about -- it was about issues, not insults. We were setting forth a positive agenda that would help America. And help millions and millions of Americans get ahead and stay ahead.And to me, that is what we're supposed to be doing. We're supposed to bring people together. We're supposed to unify our country. We're supposed to solve our problems by working together.And I know it's been a long race, but as soon as our primary finished, Senator Sanders and I got together and came up with a plan to make college affordable and pay back student debt, provide more healthcare. And we have done our best to stay out of all the meanness.You know, the other night -- did you see that last debate?Well, I was watching my opponent just go lower and lower and lower. And I was reminded of what my friend, and our first lady, Michelle Obama says.When they go low, we go high.And I want you to know I want to be -- I want to be the president for everyone. I am tired of the all the divisions and the barriers. I want to bring people together across our party lines, across any lines that divide us. And not just people who vote for me, I want to be the president, yes, for Democrats, but also Republicans and Independents.And I am very grateful for all of the Republicans who are supporting me. And I am very -- I'm very appreciative of all of the newspapers that are endorsing me, some of whom have never endorsed a Democrat before.So we're going to keep running this campaign. I want to give you something to vote for, not just something to vote against.And during these next 28 days, we're going to crisscross our country. We're going to be talking about what we can do together. But Donald Trump is taking a very different tone.His campaign -- his campaign said today that they're going to use a, quote, ""scorched Earth"" strategy for the remaining four weeks of this race. Now, that just shows how desperate they are. That's all they have left, pure negativity, pessimism.And we're not going to let Donald Trump get away with it, are we?I don't care what he says about me. I -- I -- I care about what he says about you. And I'll tell you what, I will stand up and defend every single person in this country from the insults and the disrespect that we hear from him.Now, the whole world has heard how Donald Trump treats women and what he thinks of women.And he is doubling-down on his excuse that it's just, quote, ""locker room talk.""Well, you know what happened? It just kind of happened spontaneously. A lot of athletes and coaches started posting on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook. I mean, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the NFL, and more. They are coming together and they're saying, ""That doesn't happen in our locker rooms.""But of course, you know, it's not only women that he has disrespected. He's insulted practically everybody. He went after a distinguished federal judge, Judge Curiel, who was born in Indiana. And Trump said, ""Well, he couldn't be trusted because his parents were Mexican.""He has targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos. He's targeted POWs, people with disabilities, moslems, and so many others.And every time he does that I get somebody who is worried or scared, writing me a letter or talking to me. And especially children. It's really who Donald Trump is. But when you scare children, you know, like a little boy. His mother wrote to me. She had adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. There were a lot of children in Ethiopia that were no longer able to live with families. Their parents, their grandparents were not around. And a lot of Americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named Felix is now ten years old. He's only lived in the United States. And his mother wrote me and she said that after hearing Donald Trump, he turned to her and asked, 'Mommy, will he send me back to Ethiopia?' That's the kind of fear and anxiety that I hear from immigrant families who are scared to death, especially the children, that Donald Trump is going to put together a big deportation force and go door to door, school to school, business to business, home to home.And it is hard to explain to children. And so I hope that if you know any children who are listening and watching and hearing some of what is said, you will reassure them. I want every boy and girl to know the American dream is big enough for you and there is a place in America for you.And that in this election, we will demonstrate that America is better than what Donald Trump says and represents.But here's what I also want to know. We have a big difference about how best to get the economy going. You know, Trump wants to give trillions and trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.You know, that's called trickle down economics, but as with anything when it comes to Donald Trump, he wants to have the biggest tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations than we have ever, ever had. So I believe differently. We're going to invest in the middle class. We're going to invest in you, in your jobs, in your future.Audience: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!Well, you know, you do have to feel a little sorry for them. They've had a really bad couple of weeks.But you know, part of the difference in how we see the economy I think comes from our experiences. You know, Donald grew up the son of a millionaire. He got started in business by borrowing $14 million from his dad. So it's not a surprise he wants to keep giving back to the wealthy, because that's his own experience. I grew up differently. My father was a factory worker. Well, my grandfather was a factory worker. My father was a small businessman. I know how hard they worked and I am grateful for the middle class life that they gave us, and that's what I want to make sure everybody gets.That's why I believe we've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, and we're going to focus on those issues. We're going to make it possible to have more good jobs in infrastructure. We need to fix our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports and our airports.And we need to make sure that the rich pay their fair share because here's what we've learned, Donald Trump hasn't paid a penny in federal income tax in years.Now this is all allegedly because of course we don't know for sure because he won't release his income taxes but it's allegedly because he lost $1 billion running casinos. Now I ask you, who loses $1 billion running casinos, right?Do you know how hard that is? But think about it, it means he's contributed zero. Zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for education and health and he has the gall to go around disrespecting our military.He calls the United States military a disaster.Well the only disaster is somebody who can get away with paying no taxes and have the gall to run for president and criticize all the rest of us who have done our part to support America.Now, you've all heard his slogan, Make America Great Again, right? Well that would have maybe some truth to it if he made anything in America and if he bought things that are made in America. There are so many examples but let me just give you one, which is close to your hearts, because Pueblo is one of the largest steel producing cities in America, right?So you know how important it is to support our steel workers and our steel industry.Now, Trump is the guy who went around for a year talking about how he was on the side of workers and all the rest of it. No truth to it, but you know, he did say it over and over again and we've slowly but surely uncovered how little he's done to help anybody except Donald Trump.And he has bought Chinese steel for his buildings. Not American steel. He could be buying American steel, he should be buying American steel. If he wants to make America great again, start by America with American steel.I have a very different idea and in addition to jobs and infrastructure, which uses American steel, we're going to do more on advanced manufacturing, on technology and innovation, on clean energy jobs and we're going to make the economy fairer at the same time. And here's what I want the young people and their families to hear.Senator Sanders and I got together on a plan. We are going to make public college tuition free for working families and debt free for everyone else.If you already have debt because you're trying to get your education, we're going to help you refinance it. It is wrong that you could refinance a home and refinance car but you can't refinance your student debt. And we're going to make it possible for you to pay it back as a percentage of your income.Now, based on this plan, we will save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you and your family can save. Because we want to liberate young people and families from the burden of college debt.And we're also gonna make the economy fairer by raising the national minimum wage so people who work full-time won't be in poverty.And we're going to expand Social Security for those who need it the most - low income seniors and widowed women.And we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform.I'm going to introduce reform. I can't wait to work with Senator Bennet, I can't wait to have a chance to make sure that we are working on immigration reform from the very beginning. We're gonna finally help dreamers achieve their dream of following their future and becoming American citizens.I also think it is past time, don't you, to guarantee equal pay for women's work?You know I started talking about equal pay years and years and years ago because it's not only a woman's issue it's a family issue. If you have a wife or a daughter or a mother or a sister it's your issue. Right? You know that.So Donald Trump always says, you know I'm playing the woman card. And my response is pretty simple. If being for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the woman's card, then deal me in.You see I am very excited, I am very excited about what we could do. You know I give President Obama a lot of credit. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. I remember, because he called and asked me to come see him shortly after the election.And I didn't know why. He wanted me to be secretary of state but I didn't know that. But I got there and the first thing he says is, ""It's so much worse than they told us.""And it was. You remember. It was terrible. Millions of people lost their jobs and homes were lost and it was just a horrible time. We have dug ourselves out of that ditch, thanks to everybody's hard work.And we can't ever go back there because believe me, trickle-down economics and refusing to regulate Wall Street and the mortgage market is what got us into that mess in the first place.And Donald Trump wants to get rid of the new rules on Wall Street. He wants to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which returns money to people who've been defrauded by big companies. Well I have a totally different view.We're gonna keep those and then we're going to tell companies that try to move jobs out of our country that if they try to they're gonna have to pay an exit tax and return every penny, every penny, of tax benefit they've ever gotten.And I've been very clear about how we're gonna pay for what I want to do. It is going to be going after the wealthy, closing the loopholes on corporations.I can pledge to you, I will never raise middle class federal taxes. It is not right.And what I've been trying to do listening to people around the country is figure out what we can do to help you with what I call kitchen table issues. And we thank you very much.What - right now - thank you.You know, I always feel so welcome when I come to Pueblo. I think I'll come here anytime it gets hard in the White House. What do you say?Finally I want to tell you that I want to make it easier for you to raise your kids. You know, there is nothing more important.I'm now a grandmother of two wonderful grandchildren, a little girl, a little boy. And there are too many hard-working families struggling with the cost of raising children.So right now most families with kids get something called the child tax credit. It gives a middle-class family $1000 per child to help you defray the costs. I'm going to double - I'm going to double the child tax credit.That's another $1,000 for young kids to pay for the things you need, whether it's child care, housing, prescription drugs, groceries, or anything else, it is just one example of the tax relief I want to give to working families and we're going to make sure that it gets to the people who need it most.We're going to lift families out of poverty. In fact, the changes I am proposing we think will automatically help more people get out of poverty and we're going to look for other ways to help you.What I am interested in is your success, your futures, your possibilities, your dreams. I want to be a president who makes it possible for more people to feel like they are really moving and their kids are going to have better lives.That is how I was raised. That's what I want for you and every single family, every single child in America!So we have about four weeks ago. It's going to be - it's going to be a race to the finish line, my friends. And here is what I want to ask you.As I said in the beginning, think about everything that is important to you, whether it is jobs and rising incomes, whether it is education, healthcare, whatever it might be. Whether it is protecting our rights.People who have fought so hard, whether it is immigration reform, whatever it might be, think about it because you know what?Those issues will be on the ballot. They may not be listed there, but you could not have two more different people running for president than me and Donald Trump.And I know that if people turn out, I know if people show up, we're going to win and we're going to be able to do everything I've talked about.And so it call comes to down whether or not you take that ballot you get in the mail, you fill it in, you send it back, you do everything you can to make sure that your vote will be counted.You know, when I think about this election, I do think about my grandchildren a lot. Yeah, you, too, right?I'll tell you what, for those of you who aren't grandparents yet, it is an incredible experience. Right?And there is nothing I wouldn't do for them. As I like to say, face time was invented for grandparents, and you get to check in and see how they're doing. But more than that, what kind of lives are they going to have and what kind of country is going to be waiting for them?I know how important it is that families and communities and our country stand behind every child. Make sure every child has a good education, a good school, good teachers, and every zip code in America. Make sure every child -- every child has the healthcare that he or she needs. That's why I work to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, so we can take care of millions of children.That's why every family deserves to have a good job with a good income to be able to be good providers for their kids.I got into this work so many years ago. I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, right out of law school. And I spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids. And the reason I did that is because of my own mother.I didn't know it when I was just a little girl, but I learned as I got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own, and then at the age of eight, holding her little three-year-old sister's hand, she was put on a train by themselves to go to California to live with grandparents.It turned out the grandparents didn't really want her either. So by the age of 14, she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter. But here's what I want you to know. It sounds pretty harsh. It was difficult. It made a profound impression on her life. I think my mom, who lived to the wonderful age of 92, I don't think there was a day that went by that she didn't think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own.But, along the way, people were kind to her. People helped her. The first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day, because my mother never had any -- the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school, so she said to her, Dorothy, if you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.Now, you'll have to come right back home. That might sound kind of unfortunate, but for my mom, it was a gift, because she really wanted to go to high school.And so my mother always cared about other people. And she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else, right.And we need to show each other more kindness and support. And the last thing we need in our country are more bullies making people feel bad about themselves and pushing people away, we should be drawing people toward us.We should be creating the kind of future we want for every one of our children. That's what I think about when I imagine, if I'm so fortunate enough to become president, I think about waking up -- waking up —I think about waking up in the White House every morning trying to figure out what can I do to help somebody else and who can I work with? How many families and communities across America will work with us to come up with ideas that give every single child the chance to live up to his or her God given potential?That's what I think we are called to do. Whether you're a person of faith or not, the American dream is really premised on people coming together to lift each other up. Nobody, nobody makes it alone. Everybody has somebody who helps them along the way.So let's pull together, Pueblo, let's get out and vote for the kind of positive future we want for ourselves and our children. God bless you, thank you.""","UCSB"
"64",2016-10-20,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the 71st Annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City","Secretary Clinton: ""Thank you. Your Eminence, Your Excellencies, members of the clergy, Al and Nan Smith, Donald and Melania, and all the distinguished guests.You know, earlier tonight, Al reminded me that when the first Al Smith ran for presi-dent, he chose as his running mate the progressive senator from Arkansas, Joseph T. Robinson, who was one of my husband's political heroes.This work that you do through the dinner — Al, you've done it now for 30 — 30 years — is such a labor of love. You've been a hero for both the children of the archdiocese and for the city of New York. And I think we all owe Al Smith a great, great round of applause.This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here.And as you've already heard, it's a treat for all of you too, because usually I charge a lot for speeches like this.But, for me, it was kind of ironic thinking about a fiery populist, Al Smith. If he were here today and saw how much money we've raised for needy children, he'd be very proud.And if he saw this magnificent room, full of plutocrats celebrating his legacy, he'd be very confused.It's a special honor to be here with Your Eminence. Now I know, Your Eminence, you were criticized for inviting both Donald and me here tonight, and you responded by saying ""If I only sat down with those who were saints, I'd be taking all my meals alone.""Now, just to be clear, I think the Cardinal is saying I'm not eligible for sainthood. But getting through these three debates with Donald has to count as a miracle.So I guess I'm up against the highest, hardest stained-glass ceiling. But, Your Eminence, you deserve great credit for bringing together two people who've been at each other's throats — mortal enemies, bitter foes; I've got to ask, how did you get the governor and mayor here together tonight?Now, I've got to say, there are a lot of friendly faces here in this room; people that I've been privileged to know and to work with. I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables.And you look so good in your tuxes; or, as I refer to them, formal pantsuits.And, you know, because this is a friendly dinner for such a great cause; Donald, if at any time, you don't like what I'm saying feel free to stand up and shout ""Wrong!"" while I'm talking.You know, come to think of it, it's amazing I'm up here after Donald. I didn't think he'd be okay with a peaceful transition of power.And, Donald, after listening to your speech, I will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.You know, I've had the privilege of being at the Al Smith dinners in years past and I always enjoy it. But, remember, if you're not happy with the way it comes out, it must be rigged.And it's always a special treat for me to be back in New York; a city that I love and which I think truly embodies the best of America. You know — don't you think?People look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants, a beacon of hope for people around the world. Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a ""four.""Maybe a ""five"" if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.You know, come to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman? Forty-five.But I digress. Now, I'm going to try my best tonight, but I understand I am not known for my sense of humor. That's why it did take a village to write these jokes.People say — and I hear them, I know — they say I'm boring compared to Donald. But I'm not boring at all. In fact, I'm the life of every party I attend and I've been to three.And when the parties get out of hand, as occasionally they do, it's important to have a responsible chaperone who can get everyone home safely. And that is why I picked Tim Kaine to be my Vice President.Now, you notice there is no teleprompter here tonight, which is probably smart, because maybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day. And I get that. They're hard to keep up with, and I'm sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original Russian.But every year, this dinner brings together a collection of sensible, committed, main-stream Republicans — or, as we now like to call them — Hillary supporters.Now, some of my critics — and I hear that too —Audience Member: Yeah.Secretary Clinton: Yeah.They think I only say what people want to hear. Well, tonight, that is true. And here's exactly what you want to hear — this election will be over very, very soon.And look at this dais — we've got Charlie Rose, and Maria Bartiromo, and Chris Mat-thews, and Gayle King, and Norah O'Donnell, and Katie Couric — this counts as a press conference, right?It is great, also, to see Mayor Bloomberg here.It's a shame he's not speaking tonight. I'm curious to hear what a billionaire has to say.And look at the dais — we've got the Honorable Chuck Schumer, the Honorable Andrew Cuomo, the Honorable Mike Bloomberg, the Honorable Bill DeBlasio, the Honorable Dave Dinkins, and so many other wonderful elected officials. And we have Rudy Giuliani.Now, many don't know this, but Rudy actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes. But, as the saying goes, ""If you can't beat them, go on Fox News and call them a genius.""So as I've said, we've now had our third and, thankfully, final debate. Sharing a stage with Donald Trump is like, well, nothing really comes to mind.There is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump. Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate. And look, I've got to tell you, I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer.Now, actually, I did. It's called preparation.And looking back, I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates. And he says I don't have any stamina.That is four and a half hours. I have now stood next to Donald Trump longer than any of his campaign managers.Now, look, I have deep respect for people like Kellyanne Conway. She's working day and night for Donald and because she's a contractor, he's probably not even going to pay her.But I think the good news is that the debates finally allowed Republicans to unite around their candidate. The bad news is, it's Mike Pence. And it's been a long, long campaign. That should be one of our highest priorities, shortening the campaigns.And whoever wins this election, the outcome will be historic. We'll either have the first female president or the first president who started a Twitter war with Cher.And if Donald does win, it will be awkward at the annual President's Day photo, when all the former presidents gather at the White House, and not just with Bill.How is Barack going to get past the Muslim ban?Now, Republicans in particular seem frustrated with their nominee. Paul Ryan told the Republican members of the House, you — you don't have to support the top of the ticket. Don't worry about anyone besides yourself. Just do what's in your own best interests. So I guess Donald really has unified his party around his core philosophy.And I don't understand their unhappiness. They say Donald doesn't have any policies. He has no policies. I keep hearing that.I'd actually like to defend him on this. Donald has issues, serious issues.Really, really serious issues.And I worry about Donald's go it alone attitude. For example, at his convention, when he said I alone can fix it, you know, in the '90s, I said the same thing about America's health care system and it didn't work out so well for me, either.But speaking of health, Donald has been very concerned about mine, very concerned. He actually sent a car to bring me here tonight. Actually, it was a hearse.But I — but I kind of want to just put the information out there, so everybody can draw their own conclusions and you can judge our relative health. We've each released our medical records. My blood pressure is 100/70. His is unbelievably great.My cholesterol is 189, his is presidential.My heart rate is 72 beats per minute, his is the most beats ever, or the least beats ever, whichever sounds best.But Donald really is as healthy as a horse, you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.But — but I can say without fear of contradiction tonight, that I will be the healthiest and youngest woman ever to serve as president.But this has really been a strange campaign. You saw it last night. You saw it again tonight. Donald has attacked me for a life in public service and I didn't get that at first. I kind of get it now. As he told Howard Stern, he doesn't like it when women have been around for more than 35 years.But Donald, we have so much more in common than, actually, you may realize.For example, I tried to inspire young people by showing them that with resilience and hard work anything is possible and you're doing the same. A third grade teacher told me that one of her students refused to turn in his homework because it was under audit.And here's another similarity. The Republican National Committee isn't spending a dime to help either one of us.So tonight, let's embrace the spirit of the evening. Let's come together. Remember what unites us and just rip on Ted Cruz.I hope you enjoyed my remarks tonight. I said no to some jokes that I thought were over the line. But I suppose you can judge for yourself on Wikileaks in the next few days.Donald will tell us after the benediction whether he accepts that this dinner is over. He has to wait and see. But there's nothing funny about the stakes in this election. In the end what makes this dinner important are not the jokes we tell but the legacy that we carry forward. It is often easy to forget how far this country has come.And there are a lot of people in this room tonight who themselves, or their parents or grandparents, came here as immigrants, made a life for yourselves, took advantage of the American dream and the greatest system that has ever been created in the history of the world to unleash the individual talents and energy and ambition of everyone willing to work hard.And when I think about what Al Smith went through it's important to just reflect how groundbreaking it was for him, a Catholic, to be my party's nominee for president. Don't forget – school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible. Voters were told that he would annul Protestant marriages.And I saw a story recently that said people even claimed the Holland Tunnel was a se-cret passageway to connect Rome and America, to help the Pope rule our country.Those appeals, appeals to fear and division, can cause us to treat each other as the Other. Rhetoric like that makes it harder for us to see each other, to respect each other, to listen to each other. And certainly a lot harder to love our neighbor as ourselves.I believe how we treat others is the highest expression of faith and of service. I'm not Catholic. I'm a Methodist, but one of the things that we share is the belief that in order to achieve salvation we need both faith and good works. And you certainly don't need to be Catholic to be inspired by the humility and heart of the Holy Father, Pope Francis. Or to embrace his message.His message about rejecting a mindset of hostility, his calls to reduce inequality, his warnings about climate change, his appeal that we build bridges, not walls.Now as you may know, my running mate, Tim, is Catholic and went to Jesuit schools, and one of the things he and I have talked about is this idea from the Jesuits of the Magis, the more, the better. But we need to get better at finding ways to disagree on matters of policy while agreeing on questions of decency and civility. How we talk to each other, treat each other, respect each other.So I've taken this concept of Magis to heart in this campaign, as best as one can in the daily heat, the back and forth of a presidential campaign, to ask how we can do more for each other, and better for each other. Because I believe that for each of us, our greatest monument on this earth won't be what we build, but the lives we touch.And that is ultimately what this dinner is all about. And it's why it's been such a great honor to join you all again. Thank you.""","UCSB"
"65",2016-10-21,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio","""Hello Cleveland. Wow. There is nothing like being introduced by Congresswoman Marcia Fudge to get everybody going.I am so excited to be here, what a time to be back in Cleveland.The Indians are going to the World Series.That is after the Cavs won the championship. What a year for Cleveland, you really are ""Believe Land.""Now I, for one, am hoping for a Great Lakes series, I spent a lot of days at Wrigley field as a kid, so that would be a dream come true for me, to have Cleveland and Chicago in World Series, and for us to win Ohio.I want to thank all of the people who are here today because you've heard from some great, great folks. I want to thank Governor Ted Strickland, our candidate to the United States Senate. I'll tell you, we could really use a Democratic senate to get things done for the people of Ohio and America.I wanna thank Mayor Frank Jackson, County Executive, Armond Budish. I wanna thank my great friend from Youngstown, Congressman Tim Ryan.And we need you all in. We need you all in. You're rallying together and we need to rally together because you know, I really believe we are stronger together!Anybody watch the debate Wednesday night? Well, that was the third and last time. That I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.I have now spent four and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again, I have the stamina to be president and commander in chief.Really, you -- you just have to be a good cheer when you find yourself in situations like that.And because I love this country and I believe in the American people, I could feel so clear in my own mind and my heart about what we can do together. So no matter what he was saying, I just kept thinking of all the people that I have met throughout this campaign. And I had the chance to talk about some of the most important concerns on people's minds, what keeps you up at night. And as I said then and as I have said continuously, we're going to invest in the middle class.We're going to invest in you and your families. We're going to make sure we produce enough good jobs with rising incomes that every single person, especially every single young American here today, will have the chance to go as far as your talents and your hard work will take you. And we're also going to protect our children from gun violence. We are not going to tolerate the kind of gun violence epidemic that has swept this country and results in the deaths of 33,000 people a year. We can come together to meet our challenges, no matter what they are.But on Wednesday night, Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done. He refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.Now, make no mistake. By doing that, he is threatening our democracy.He is basically saying hey, we've been around 240 years and we've always had peaceful transitions no matter who won or who lost. Look, if you lose an election -- I've lost elections, you don't feel very good the next day, do you?But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?And the peaceful transition -- the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart. It's how we hold our country together no matter who's in charge. You know, I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and I -- I saw the difference between what we do and what others do, I was in countries where people jail their political opponents or execute them or exile them. Or invalidate elections that they didn't win.That can never be allowed to happen here. I believe that's true no matter who you support in this election, whether or not you support me. Or you support my opponent, together, we must support American democracy and the country that has given every one of us so many opportunities.And the best way to do that, my friends, is to turn out and vote.[points to an audience member holding a sign]Those are great. That is great. I'm excited because we are well on our way, there is an inspiring story being written right now by people across America, and many of you are getting involved in this election, some of you for the first time in your lives. We now have in America more than 200 million registered voters.That is more than we have ever had in our entire history, and that is really good news for our democracy. More than 50 million millennials have registered.You know what that means? Young people will determine the outcome of this election, which I think is good news. That means our future is in good hands.And listen to this, because this is really exciting. More than 4 million people have already voted.Including many people right here in Ohio.In fact, in the first four days of in-person early voting here in Ohio, more people showed up to vote than they did at the same time in 2012, in our last election.That is fantastic and it shows how serious people are taking this election. So numbers like that remind us that no matter all the negativity that's out there, there is something really exciting happening right now. People are coming together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, all of us to reject hate and division.People are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, to embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, and everyone can contribute. That is my vision. I have a hopeful, optimistic, unifying vision for what our country will be. Because from the beginning, our campaign has been focused on ideas, not insults, on bringing people together, not tearing us apart.And I want all of you to know that that is true not only for the campaign, but if I am fortunate enough to be your president, I want you to know, and I want you to tell anybody you know, any friends, or colleagues at school or work, or your neighborhood who may be planning to support the other guy, here is what I want you to tell them.I want you to tell them that I want to be their president. I want to be every single American's president, whether you agree or disagree, whether you vote for me or against me.I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I believe that. And I have seen that happen. I want to be a good listener. I know there are a lot of people here in Ohio who are discouraged, frustrated, even angry about what is going on in their lives, about losing jobs, they are upset about what they see happening around them. I get that.But I think anger is not a plan. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have here in Ohio. I think that is what the country needs now. And that is what I will try to offer.CLINTON: I am not going to pretend that we can just snap our fingers and solve our problems. That would not be fair. It wouldn't be true. But I know we can make progress together and you deserve something to vote for, not just against.So I want to speak directly to the challenges that a lot of people here in Ohio face, especially when it comes to our economy. You see I believe really simply that when the middle class thrives, America thrives. When we build the economy from the middle out and the ground up, not from the top down, we are more likely to provide better lives, better incomes, better opportunities for more Americans.My opponent has a different perspective. He really believes if you give trillions, that's with a T, trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, to millionaires and billionaires and corporations, everything will work out. It's really trickle down on steroids. I believe differently that we must invest in working families in the middle class, in small businesses, that will power the economy.And that's what we're going to do. We're going to get the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top who have done pretty well over the last years. Now Donald likes to say he's on the side of American workers but his actions tell a different story. He has been buying cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects when he should be buying good American made steel that supports good American jobs.And this is a very important issue here in Ohio because you're one of the largest steel producing states in America so you understand how important this is to support the American steel industry so I'm going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steel workers filing for unemployment. He has put Chinese steel workers to work, not American steel workers and we're going to change that.And for all of his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump's suits were made in Mexico. They could have been made in Brooklyn, Ohio. Trump's furniture is made in Turkey and it could have been made in Cleveland. Trump barware is made in Slovenia instead of Toledo. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America again?And we also know that he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years.He says that makes him smart. Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose $1 billion in a year in the first place. But what that means is everybody else here, all of us, have paid more in federal income taxes than a billionaire, right? And that means he's contributed zero, zero for our military or our vets, zero for Pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways or investing in clean energy or other ways to help us with new jobs for the future.Now Tim Kaine and I, we have a different view. We want to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure and manufacturing, clean energy, technology and small business. We are going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.And I've set some big goals. I want us to deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term.And enough clean energy to power every home within 10 years.We're also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal pre-kindergarten education.And we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so that every kid gets a world class education. I want us to bring back technical education in high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out of our high schools.And let's remember, it's at community colleges like this that thousands and thousands of people in our country, of all ages, get such a good start.And I'm going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.Education should lift you up, not hold you back. And we're going to help you, we're going to help you pay back and pay down your loans. Too many young people are burdened by those debts.It's going to be great to help you pay it back as a percentage of your income, so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford. Senator Bernie Sanders and I worked on this plan together.It's going to help save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can actually go to HillaryClinton.com/calculator to see how much money you and your family could save with our plan.I also want to do more for apprenticeship programs. I thank all the unions represented here for the great apprentice programs that you have in place. Thank you.I want to support apprenticeship programs and skills trainings with business and labor unions, because there are going to be good jobs out there for welders, and machinists, and health technicians, and computer coders, and so much more. I want everybody to have the chance to get your piece of the American dream, and I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.And we're going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty.As I said in the debate the other night, I want to make sure that we take care of people on Social Security who were low-income workers and women, particularly widows, who lose have of their monthly payment when their husbands die.We've got to do more to make sure Social Security provides a decent income for our seniors. And, yes, don't you think it's finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?Now the equal pay issue is important in and of itself because, if you've got a mother or a wife or a daughter or a sister who's working, you want her to be paid fairly. I mean that's good for the entire family, right?But the equal pay issue gets at something even deeper. We've got to make sure that women and girls are treated with the dignity and respect in our country that they deserve.We cannot -- we cannot tolerate the kind of behavior and language we've seen from my opponent. He thinks that belittling women makes him bigger. Goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know how that feels.So we're going to stand up for everybody, men and women, retirees, the young, millennials, everybody deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.And I have said repeatedly that we're going to reform the criminal justice system so that it works fairly for everyone. And we have to address systemic racism that is still too big a part of our lives together.I want to give credit to all the young people, and really people of all ages, who've been marching and speaking out, doing everything you can to make sure that issues of policing and mass incarceration, environmental justice, economic justice, educational equity, gun violence, voting rights, that they get the attention they deserve. Because it's important that we lift these issues up and work to make sure that everybody in our country feels like they are seen and they are heard. And all the advocates and activists who have challenged us to think about these issues of race and justice and equality and opportunity in new and powerful ways really deserve our appreciation.I'm going to do everything I can to lift these issues up, because one of my hopes for my presidency will be to root out systemic racism and bigotry and discrimination in whatever form it takes.So really, when you think about it, my name will be on the ballot, but it is not just me. People say, well, she has lots of plans and all of that. I do, but I also have a lot of humility about this.I really believe our country is at a turning point, that this is a crossroads election. So yes, my name may be on the ballot, but the question really is, who are we as a country? What are our values? What kind of future do we want to create together?It is so easy to get cynical about politics, believe me, I know that. But this matters so deeply to our families and our communities and our country, and indeed our world.So I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support for my opponent. I know you may still have questions for me. I respect that, I want to answer them, I want to earn your vote.I am reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents. I think America needs every single one of us to bring our energy and our talents, our ambition to build that better country.So I hope that as we move through these next 18 days, everyone thinks seriously about what you really want to see, not just in your next president, but in your lives, in your jobs, in your education, in our future together.And the only way we can have that positive, optimistic, unifying future is if all of you help us get there. Every phone call you make, every door you knock on, every voter you register makes a big difference.So I hope you will give whatever time you can for these last days. You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. You can text ""JOIN,"" J-O-I-N, to 47246 to join. With your help, we can elect Democrats up and down the ballot starting with Ted Strickland and others who are running.Remember that early in-person voting in Ohio began on October 12th and it ends on November 7th. So you have more of a window to vote than a lot of people in other states.And I hope you will exercise that. And I hope that you will decide whatever issue you care about, you can almost in your mind's eye see that on the ballot, see it next to my name, see it whether you care about climate change and what we are doing to protect the Great Lakes, including Lake Eerie, while creating good paying clean energy jobs.Whether you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions.If you believe marriage equality should be protected.And that LGBT Americans should be treated equally.If you believe we should do more to stop the opioid epidemic that is destroying lives and communities.That we should do more to help with mental health and make sure that people get the treatment that they deserve. If you believe we need to get the cost of health care, premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and prescription drug costs down.If you believe that we should have a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals toward peace and prosperity.This is our chance to send a very clear, unmistakable message about what kind of country and future we want.You know, I have two of the most wonderful grandchildren ever, and I see them whenever I can, I FaceTime with them all the time.But I think about them endlessly because I feel such a sense of responsibility, not just because they're my grandchildren, obviously, and I would do anything to help them, but because I want everybody's children and grandchildren to have the same opportunities, to chart your own future, to believe in yourself, to contribute to this great America democracy of ours.To be part on an economy that lifts you up, not drags you down. I am motivated by my work that I've done my entire life on behalf of kids and families.From the time I joined the Children's Defense Fund, until today. And I will do whatever I can to make it my mission to give every single person, especially every child and young person, the chance to live up to your God-given potential.Let's go out and prove that love trumps hate. Thank you!""","UCSB"
"66",2016-10-22,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks to the Press Aboard the Campaign Plane in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","Secretary Clinton: ""We are really happy to campaign together. As you know, Tim has been doing the most amazing job around the country hitting every state multiple times along with Ann, his extraordinary wife, who has been campaigning tirelessly on her own as well. So we don't get a lot of chance to actually gather because we want to cover more ground together. But today was a real opportunity for us. I just want to make two quick points. First, as we are traveling in the last 17 days, we are going to be emphasizing the importance of electing democrats down ballot. And in particular, as I said today, we are strongly supportive of Katie Mcginty in her race for the senate. We will be, I think, meeting up with her in Philadelphia tonight. So we will have a chance to do that with her. I will be doing the same as we go from state to state, as will Tim. The other point is today, we are making our closing arguments. We are talking about what is at stake in the election we are drawing contrasts, but we are giving people something to vote for, not just against. And I saw where our opponent Donald Trump went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said, if he's president, he will spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior. Tim and I are going to keep talking about what we want to do if we are given the great honor of serving as president and vice president. As we said in the book, ""Stronger To-gether"" we have very specific plans. And we are going to get together after the election and do everything possible to be prepared on January 20th to start doing the business of the American people.Reporter: Secretary Clinton, Trump today also suggested that democrats or the Clinton campaign were behind these women coming forward and making these accusations. What do you have to say to that?Secretary Clinton: That is just not accurate.Reporter: We have started to hear some republicans say that it if you win, it will not be because American voters have endorsed your platform, but rather that they have rejected Trumps. How would you respond to that, and would that get in the way of an effort to bring the country back together, and have a mandate for the presidency?Secretary Clinton: Well clearly we are going to spend the next 17 days making the case to persuade as many Americans as possible across our country to vote for Tim and me. We have close elections in America. You can go back and check that out for the last 4, 6, 8 of them. it is not unusual that the election would be close. So we are not taking anything for granted. We are working our hearts out and covering as much ground. We have great events planned. We have great surrogates coming out to support us that are both campaigning with us and campaigning on their own to try to convince as many people as possible to go vote. As i said in pittsburgh, we are seeing some really encouraging signs about the turnout. the 200 million voter registration mark is huge, it's never been reached before. 50 million as the best estimate being young people is so encouraging. And then what we are seeing from early vote returns, I think we are over 4 million already. So I am not going to speculate about the outcome of the election, people know what Tim and I want to do. We have been very clear about that. We've laid it out in every way that we could in every different kind of forum. And I am going to be reaching out to people on the other side of the aisle, to everybody that will possibly come together with us.Reporter: Do you see any of the outreach you have done to republicans who have rejected Donald Trump as carrying over into your potential administration? And how would fishers in the party impact some of those big items on your agenda, particularly immigration?Secretary Clinton: Amy, I am very encouraged by what I think we can get accomplished. I came into the senate in 2000 as you know, and I made it clear from the beginning that I wanted work with people. I didn't have any expectations about being treated any differently than anybody else. And I think you can go back and look at the record that I compiled by working with practically every republican I served with. I think, last time we had it counted, 400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or cosponsor. You don't get that done unless you work with folks on the other side. So I have a record of doing that, not just in the senate, but as first lady and secretary of state. And people know that. And we will begin to get to work right away and reach out to everybody that we can possibly touch to start talking about what we can do together. And I think there is a big agenda where we can find common ground.Reporter: Madam Secretary, have you thought at all about who you might put in your cabinet if you win?Clinton: No I really haven't. I am a little superstitious about that. We have got a transition operation going, and I haven't really paid much attention to it yet because I want to focus on what our first task is, and that is convincing as many Americans as possible to give us the chance to serve.Reporter: What kind of qualities are you looking for—Secretary Clinton: I am not going to talk anymore about that.Reporter: I was wondering, you touched on it earlier at the event, but what would your response be to trump's assertion that there is a vast media conspiracy against him supporting your campaign?Secretary Clinton: You know, I debated him for 4.5 hours. I am not even going to think about responding to him anymore. I will let the American people think about what he offers and what we offer. He can say whatever he wants and he can run his campaign however he wants to. He can go off on tangents, he can go to Gettysburg and say he's going to sue women who have made accusations against him. I am going to keep talking about what we want to do, what we think the country de-serves from the next president and vice president. And actually when it comes right down to it, that is what I think people end up voting on. Thank you all very much.Reporter: Secretary Clinton, are you truly concerned that Donald trump would try to throw you in jail if he were elected? And one other issue, there was a Wikileaks email in which one of you top aids said that a Clinton Foundation conference, that's now being labeled by some of your critics as a pay to play scheme, was a mess of your own making. Would you comment on that as well?Secretary Clinton: No, I have nothing to say about Wikileaks, other than I think we should all be concerned about what the Russians are trying to do to our election and using Wikileaks very blatantly to try to influence the outcome of the election. I have no concerns about the first question whatsoever.""","UCSB"
"67",2016-10-22,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","Secretary Clinton: ""Thank you! Thank you all so much!Wow. It is so great to be back here in Pittsburgh. I do not think it gets any better than to be accompanied out onto the stage by Dan and Pat Rooney. I am a big admirer of the Rooney family and I was so honored to serve with Dan when he was our ambassador to Ireland. The Rooney family commitment to Pittsburgh is really extraordinary, and it's not just the amazing commitment to the Stealers. As special as that is, but to their roots, what they believe in, their values, and their deep concern for future generations. So I am incredibly humbled to be supported by Dan and Pat and the Rooney family. It means a great deal to both Tim and me.I also want to thank congressman Mike Doyle who is here with us. Allegheny and county executive Richard Fitzgerald who is here. Mayor Bill Peduto. Mayor John Federman. Pennsylvania attorney general Bruce Beemer. And all the other elected officials, it means a lot for you to be here with us. If all goes well in 17 days, we are looking forward to working with you on behalf of Pittsburgh.Some of you know that I have a special place in my heart for Pennsylvania, and I am excited about helping, in any way that we can, for Pittsburgh, Allegheny county, and western Pennsylvania to keep moving forward with confidence and optimism about what is possible for the future we want to create together. I am thrilled to be here with Tim Kaine.I asked him to be my running mate because I knew he would be one of the smartest, toughest, most qualified vice presidents we have ever had. And I also knew he had never lost an election.I kind of figured that might rub off on me a little bit. Now that I have gotten to spend more time with him, and with his wonderful wife Anne and their family, I am even more confident that he will be such an extraordinary leader for our country. He is not just smart, tough and qualified, Tim Kaine is as good and decent a person as you will ever meet.I am deeply honored to have him by my side in this campaign. Tim and I are excited by all of the energy and enthusiasm we are seeing across the country, and particularly here in Pennsylvania.But both of us, unlike our opponent, do not believe we can do this alone. We believe that we are going to do this by working with all of you. And that we are going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote because whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot. It may not be listed, but it will be on the ballot. Whether you care about new, good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down. What ever it is you care about, it is literally going to be on that ballot. Now, my name and Tim's name may be the ones on the ballot, but we are going to be representing everything that we can do that you hope for our country. And we're going to need help doing that after the election, and that is why I hope you will do everything you can to elect Katie Mcginty, your next senator. You know, Katie is the daughter of a Philadelphia police officer. I think she is one of 10 children, right? One of 10 children. She has devoted her professional life to protecting working families. I have known her now for more than 20 years, when she was really young, and I have seen that same can-do spirit. She just gets up every day, and asks what can she do to fight for healthier neighborhoods, to keep our kids and healthy, to fight for cleaner air and cleaner water, to help people make the most out of their own lives. Now she is running for the senate, because like Tim and I, she believes our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top. Katie is exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate. But more importantly, she is exactly the kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs in the senate. We have got to get things done for the people of Pennsylvania and America, and Katie will help us break through the gridlock, actually make a difference in people's lives, help us create more good jobs with rising incomes, guarantee equal pay for women, defending planned parenthood.And I think it is pretty clear when you look at Katie's opponent -- he still refuses to stand up to Donald Trump. A lot of republicans have. They have had the grit to stand up and say 'he does not represent me'. But Pat Toomey heard Donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in Iraq. He heard Donald called Mexican immigrants rapists, he heard him say terrible things about women. He heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasn't really born in America -- how much more does Pat Toomey need to hear? If he doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all this, then can you be sure he will stand up for you when it counts against powerful interests? So, you know, when I look at this, I'm thinking to myself, we have work to do in Washington. And I know it's not easy. I understand we have some real challenges. I believe we can do it. I would not be standing here, Tim would not be with me -- but we need people in Washington who put you first, who get up every day thinking about middle-class families, who worry about where you are going to get the money to send your kids to college, how you are going to take care of your mom or dad because they are failing and what are you going to do for them? How are you going to deal with all of the challenges? That is what I try to do my entire life. That is who you should be electing, people who care about you, your families, your children. Now, as Tim said, he asked if any of you watched the debate on Wednesday. Well, I will tell you, that was the third and last time I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.I mean, think about this, I have now spent 4 and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again I have the stamina to be President and commander in chief.And after every one of those debates, people have said, how did you do that? And really, you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that. You are in front of 50, 60, 70, 80 million people. So, no matter what he would say, I just kept thinking of all the people I have met throughout this campaign. Just early today I've met Henry over there. Henry is on top of his dad's shoulders, and Henry gave me a note saying he hoped I would be president, and you know, I really want to be president for all of the kids in America to do everything I can to help you.You know, I also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me. From the first day I started this campaign back in april 2015, people have been telling me what is on their minds, and it is one of the greatest honors. You know, sometimes it is just fleeting. I will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or I will come down and shake hands on a rope line, just running into somebody. And that person, that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop, looks into my eyes. I can tell they are trying to take my measure, and I am grateful that they take their vote, their choice so seriously. And then they might say something like, I have a really terrible problem in my family. My son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin. What are you going to do about it? Or maybe they will say, my brother has schizophrenia, and we can't afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs . Or maybe they will say, I am a diabetic. And the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin, and I can't afford it. What are you going to do about it? That is the right question to ask anybody running for president, because at the end of the day, this is about you. As I said the other night, we are going to invest in the middle class. We are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.And we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person, especially every single young person in America can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you. Now, I've got to say, I believe in hard work. That is how I was raised. I believe you've got to work for what you get in life. But I think we have to knock down some of the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and going as far as they should. For me, that starts by believing in our country. You know, there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many. Do we have problems? We have problems. Do we have challenges? Of course we do. We are human beings. But boy, there is no more blessed place. And Donald Trump did something the other night that no other presidential nominee has ever done of either party. He refused to say he would respect the results of this election. Make no mistakes about this, my friends. He is threatening our democracy. Look, I have lost elections. You don't feel very good the next day, believe me. But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right? You know, the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart, and whether you support me or my opponent, together we must show we support American democracy. And I believe both Donald Trump and I should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us. And the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote. And there is an inspiring story being written by people across America right now. We have just reached a milestone, more than 200 million Americans are registered to vote in this election. And you know what? That includes 50 -- more than 50 million young people. More than ever before. I find that a very hopeful sign. And here in Pennsylvania, hundreds of thousands of more voters are registered then were in 2012. What does this tell us? I think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there, something exciting is happening right now. People are coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents -- all to reject hate and division.And in the states where they can, people are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, and embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, everyone can contribute. You see, despite what Donald Trump may think, most Americans really believe we can do better. Most Americans really believe women should be respected.Most Americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly. Most Americans be-lieve that the United States should work with our allies to lead the world and keep us safe. The energy we are seeing in the final weeks of this campaign is about more than winning an election. It is about standing up to the kind of country that we want for ourselves and our children. And it is about the kind of lessons we want to teach our sons and daughters. I want you to know, if Tim and I are fortunate enough to be your president and vice president, we will work with everyone. Now I imagine here in allegheny county and if you are from further west, you probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump. And here is what I want you to tell them. I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too. Because whether you agree or disagree with me, whether you vote for me or vote against me, I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I have seen that. I know it can happen. And I know there are a lot of people here in Pennsylvania who have a lot of questions. They want to know, how do we move forward better. They want to know about their town where there used to be a lot of jobs and there are not as many any more. They are upset what they see around them. I get that. But anger is not a plan.And we need -- we need to work together. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in Pennsylvania. I think that is what our whole country needs right now. That's what I will try to do. I am not going to pretend that we can snap our fingers and solve our problems. That does not happen in the real world. But I know we can make progress together. The choice we face in this election is stark, especially when it comes to the economy. Tim and I believe when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And when we invest in working families, in the middle class, in small businesses, we can make the economy work again for everybody. I think it is fair to say that both Donald Trump and Pat Toomey have a different perspective. They believe -- and they believe this -- if you give trillions of dollars -- and they mean trillion with a t -- of tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, corporations, it will all trickle down to everybody else. It has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up, and I have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal -- right. Married to one, that's right. Worked for one. And here is what I know. That when you focus on helping the middle class, you end up lifting everybody. When you focus on helping the top, you help the top. That is not good enough. Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers, but his actions tell a different story. Yes, he has bought cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects. He should be buying good American-made steel that supports good American jobs.I would like to hear Donald explain to American steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put Chinese steel workers to work, instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania. And for all his talk about putting America first, he has made many of his products in 12 different countries. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America? And we now know -- we now know he hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes for years. He says that makes him smart. Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place. Especially -- answer me this -- how do you lose a billion dollars when you are in the casino business? Never could figure that out. But what it means is that every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has. That is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks. I will tell you what. It also means Donald has contributed zero -- zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways, zero for everything. And yet he stands up on stage and criticizes America. Well it's unfair and it's wrong. With your help, we will make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our water systems all need help, and those are a lot of good jobs waiting to be done, jobs that can't be exported out of Pennsylvania.I believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States. That is why we will invest $10 billion in a make it in America partnerships that brings together workers and unions and businesses, universities, and community colleges. Some countries are going to take the lead with precision machineries. Some countries is going to take the lead with 3-d printing. We invented both of those technologies. We should take the lead and we should have the jobs. We are also going to fight climate change with clean, renewable energy jobs. And we are going to help small businesses which will create two thirds of all of the new jobs in America. And we are going to defend your right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and benefits. Don't let anybody fool you, my friends. assault on worker rights and unions is an assault on the middle class. It is time to say loudly and clearly, right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America.So, I have set some big goals. I am excited about what we are going to do. And it's all going to put people to work right here. And sometimes folks say to me, how are you going to get that done? You go to the congress —well first of all, I hope we will elect some or democrats. That will be job number one. Number two, I think it will be a very simple question. Our members of congress, members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy, or on your side? And you know what? They are going to have to answer that question. Because if they stay beholden to the special interest, if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyist and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors -- I have been in the senate. I have seen it. I know it. If they are going to continue to do the work of those who are already privileged in America, then I want to make sure that they don't come back to Washington after the next election.We are in a great, great high school here, and I am so proud to be here.And so, we are going to be a good partner with education, especially with educators. We are going to start with universal pre-k. We want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so every kid gets a world-class education. And I want us to bring technical education back to high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out. There are a lot of good jobs that you can be prepared for in today's economy -- coming out of high school, maybe going to community college, going into an apprenticeship program, and I want to lift up that work. A four-year college degree should not be and is not the only way to have a good job with the rising income and a satisfying life. We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And we are going to help you pay down your college debt.It's going to be great. To help you pay it back as a percentage of your income at your job, so you are never on the hook for more than you can afford. I worked on this with Senator Bernie Sanders, and it's going to help save -- it's going to help save people thousands of dollars. In fact after a year, maybe after you are here -- you can go to hillaryclin-ton.com/calculator to see how much your family can save. We want you to know we are going to deliver results for you. I mean, ultimately it's pretty simple. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody and I want everybody to have your chance to get your piece of the American dream. So, there's a lot of work we are going to be doing. We need to raise the national mini-mum wage. People who work full-time should not be mired in poverty. We are, as Tim said, going to guarantee equal pay for women. You know, look, it's not just a woman's issue. If you have a mother, which all of us do -- if you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, or a sister who's working, it's your issue. It's good for the entire family, it's good for our economy. So my friends, there is a lot for us to do in the next 17 days. Because we have got to get the word out. We have got to tell everybody what we are doing and why this election is so critically important. And that's where all of you come in. If you do know people who are thinking about voting for our opponent.Audience Member: Nope!Secretary Clinton: Well, you may. You know, I hope you will stage an intervention.And I do hope you will talk about, you know, the reality versus the demagoguery of what we have seen in this campaign. You know, we need to come together around all of the issues that are important to everybody and as I said in the beginning, whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot. I care a lot about making sure that women and girls are treated with dignity and respect that they deserve in our country.I care a lot about making sure that we save social security and we ensure that everybody has the benefits that they need in order to be able to live a decent life in retirement. And, boy, do I care a lot about our constitution. And maybe it's because on your behalf I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state. And I met a lot of people who in the us because we have been so steady and so committed to our constitutional system and our values. And what I hope is that you care as deeply as our founders did, as our parents and grandparents did, because maybe they came from somewhere else where they weren't treated right. Maybe they saw firsthand what it meant to be deprived of the rule of law. You know, every time Donald Trump says he wants to jail his opponent, meaning me, I think to myself, you know, we don't do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary. Or, you know, when he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on. You know, I get criticized by the press. I know that is part of our democratic system. We believe in a free press. And boy, if you go to countries where there isn't one, you will understand why that is so important. And when he says there should be a religious test -- a religious test for people at our borders, a country founded on religious freedom. You have to ask yourself, who is going to conduct the test? Are we going to get a quiz? What if the border security official does not believe you? Who gets to decide whether you get to come in or out based on your religion? And if you haven't seen it yet, I hope you will go and look at the extraordinary statement by Mr. Khan on Youtube in a new video that we have put out. You remember, he pulled out a constitution at our convention. And he reveres our constitution. And for good reason. Because he, too, came from a place where the was no rule of law to speak of. So, whatever issue you care about, this is an issue that will be decided by this election, and that is why I'm reaching out to republicans, democrats, independents, everyone. I know if we bring our talent, our energy, and our ambition to the work of building our country, we are going to see the best days of America ahead of us, and when your chil-dren and your grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I hope you will say you voted for a better America.So, here we go. Just remember -- you've got to get out and vote, you've got to get everybody you know to get out and vote. If you do not know where to vote, please go to iwillvote.com. You can put your information in and, it is the magic of the internet. They will tell you where you are supposed to vote. You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. Or you can take your phone out right and text join to 47246. And if we can get all of you and everybody you know involved in this next 17 days, I will tell you this -- it is easy to forget how far our country has come. There are a lot of people here -- as I said, whose parents and grandparents came here as immigrants. My grandfather, Hugh Rodam, came as an immigrant, as a young boy and settled in Scranton. And he went to work in the Scranton lace mills, he went to work in his teens, he worked there until he retired at the age of 65. He believed in our country. He believed in the kind of future he could get through his hard work. That is what I want everybody in our country to believe again. We are going to unleash the talent, the innovation, the energy that brought people like my grandfather here, but which we will harness for the future. Don't let anybody tell you America's best days are behind us. Don't believe that for a minute.We are going to pull together. We are going to make it clear that confidence and opti-mism, respect for each other, bringing folks together who may disagree but can begin to find common ground is what has always worked and it will work again. Help us. Help us create that kind of future, and help us prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you all.""","UCSB"
"69",2016-10-25,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Broward College's North Campus in Coconut Creek, Florida","Hello, Broward County!Whoa. It is so great to be back in Florida. There are just 14 days, two weeks from today.The most important election in our lifetimes. I'm so grateful to see all of you and I want to thank the elected officials who are here, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schult,Congressman Alcee Hastings, Congressman Ted Deutch, Commissioner Mark Bogen and others who are here, along with Senator Bill Nelson's wonderful wife, Grace Nelson. So we are glad you are all here with me.And I got to tell you, I was thrilled to be introduced by the person I hope will be the next senator from the great state of Florida, Congressman Patrick Murphy.You know, I think Patrick is exactly the kind of senator that Florida needs and deserves because he will help us break through gridlock and create more good jobs with rising incomes. And Patrick knows we have to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.I also appreciate the fact that we now are seeing an emerging bipartisan consensus that we need to fix our broken criminal justice system, do you agree? But it's going to take strong and committed leaders, like Patrick Murphy, who are ready to show up and fight hard and work to get this done. And -- and this is important, my friends, unlike his opponent, Patrick Murphy has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.I think Florida deserves a senator who's going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families together against a deportation force.This is what is so unimaginable, of law enforcement officials to go door to door, house to house, business to business, school to school, rounding up 11 million people. I think that is so wrong, and it is not going to happen in America. So you deserve also a senator who actually believes climate change is real, as opposed to someone who every time he's asked says, well I'm not a scientist. And I always wonder, why don't you talk to a scientist? Like start here at Broward College, you could talk to scientists.And you deserve a senator who would never say that Social Security and Medicare have, and this is a quote, ""weakened us as a people.""His solution, Patrick's opponent's solution, is to privatize Medicare.Audience: Boo!Clinton: That is exactly the right response, but don't boo, vote, right?And you deserve a senator who would never support cutting $360 million from Florida's schools, because Patrick knows every child in Florida deserves a world-class education. So my friends, Patrick Murphy is a smart, tough-minded legislator and an independent voice.That's what we need more of in Washington, people like Patrick who are going to get up every day and go to work for you, a better life for you and your families, instead of blocking progress at every turn, listening to the special interests and powerful forces that really are not interested in what it's going to take for every one of you to get ahead and stay ahead.So please, when you get out and vote, please remember you can send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate, and you will be glad you did.Now, I know there's an overflow crowd outside and I'm so sorry they can't be in, but I'm told that they can hear us and maybe even see us, and I want to thank them for coming as well.I got to ask you, did anybody see the last debate?Well, the good news -- the good news was, it was the last debate.Audience: Happy birthday to you!Clinton: Well, thank you!Thank you. Yeah, you know, you're right. That last debate was like an early birthday present, right? But here's what I wanted you to remember. I stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving once again I have the stamina to be president and commander- in-chief.You know, I tried as much as I could to talk about all issues that are on your minds that I believe we can work together to improve. And in fact, my wonderful running mate I, Senator Tim Kaine, wrote a book, called ""Stronger Together,"" and we put all of our policies in it because I want you to know what we're going to try to do if we're so fortunate enough to be the next president and vice president. And I think it's important, because I want you to have confidence that we're going to work every day to implement the plans that we have put forth. And I tried in the debate to draw the contrasts with Donald Trump, who doesn't really have very many plans. You know, I've tried to run a campaign based on issues, he's run a campaign based on insults. And so in the debate, we didn't have a lot to talk about, other than he continued true to form to throw out his insults.But in that last debate, he said something that I found horrifying. Well, he said a lot of things, cut there's one thing in particular that I wanted to point out because no presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, has ever said this. He refused to say that he would respect the outcome the election.I guess we shouldn't be too surprised, this is the same guy who said he thought the Emmys were rigged against him. But this is serious. You know, on January 20th, the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and I have serious doubts about whether Donald Trump even understands what that means.In America, we don't say we're going to keep you in suspense about whether we will respect the outcome of an election. We have free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power. That is one thing that makes American great, it makes America who we are.And we don't impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty. And we don't punish newspapers or journalists that try to cover the news or are critical of politicians, or threaten to restrict the First Amendment, because our democracy depends on a free press. And we don't incite violence and turn people against each other. We respect the open exchange of ideas that a democracy depends on.You know, I've got to say, I bet some of you or maybe your parents, or your grandpar-ents, came from places where none of that was true, right? There is a reason why America is the greatest and longest lasting democracy the world has ever known, because we believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love, you have the right to be treated equally and fairly in the United States.And Donald Trump is attacking everything that has set our country apart for 240 years. Now, after spending his entire campaign attacking one group of Americans after another -- immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, women, POWs, Muslims, people with disabilities -- now his final target is democracy itself. So here's what I want you to know, in the four years, we are going to change some things in America, right?I do want to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. And we're going to do that, along with other positive changes, but we are not going to change the fundamental values that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.You know, I think it all started -- I think this all started when George Washington re-fused to become a king. Right? Now, Donald Trump probably would have called him a loser.Instead, that was one of the most important decisions any president has ever made. Eight years, it's time to move on. We fought a revolution so that we would not have a king. We would not be subjects, we would be independent citizens. I cherish that idea.So here's the good news. Americans are coming together. At the very moment when Donald Trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy, millions of people are registering, voting early and volunteering in this campaign.And here's something very exciting. We have reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are now registered, and that includes 15 million young people, the most ever in history.And you know what? More than six million people have already voted and more than one million of them are right here in Florida. So I think you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they really believe in, and that includes not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents coming together to reject hate and division, and I am so excited about what that means.But the energy we are seeing across Florida and America is not just because of what we are against, it's about what we're for. It really is. It's about fighting for that future where everyone counts, everyone has a place and no one is left out or behind. But I want you to know we still have a lot of work to do. I feel good, but boy, I am not taking anything for granted. I'm going to work as hard as I can between now and the close of the election that's two weeks from today.And you know, it's so important for Florida. There are so many issues that we need to remind people about. Last time I was here, I campaigned with Al Gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis. And you know why? Because we're seeing the reality of climate change every day in Florida. We are seeing areas in Miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding. And the ocean is rising.And what we've got to do is make sure that this issue -- fighting climate change, creating clean renewable energy jobs -- stays at the top of the priorities, and that's why you need a new senator like Patrick Murphy.I have to say, nobody should want to wake up on November 9th and wonder whether there was more you could have done. I hope you will wake up on November 9th proud that you took a stand and voted for an America that belongs to all of us, where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them.I got to tell you, I believe America is great because America is good.And I want to tell you one other thing. I want to say one other thing that's really very important to me. We should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country.That's why I was so appalled when Donald Trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote him, ""a total disaster"" and that our country is, again a quote, ""looking dumb."" Really? He's declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He's proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military.Here's another example. He was asked if he would defend our allies. He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them. And when asked specifically about Israel, he said, and I quote again, he would ""love to be neutral.""Now, we can't have a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because in his mind, everything is negotiable.I have a different view. We stand with our allies. We stand with those who will help us defeat terrorism.So I -- I get pretty excited about what we could to together. And with your help, we're going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II -- jobs in infra-structure and advanced manufacturing, and clean renewable energy, and small busi-nesses. I want us to make America the clean energy super power of the 21st century.We can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time. And I've got to say no state, no state should care more about this issue than Florida. Right? And you know, I'll tell you something that it's kind of sad, to be honest with you. I've traveled all over the country. And in New Jersey and Massachusetts, they have more solar power than the Sunshine State.Why? Well, because you have a governor and a legislature who, like your current senator, doesn't want to believe the science of climate change; doesn't see the opportunity that Florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy.And so I want to deploy a half-billion more solar panels by the end of my first term, and enough clean energy to power every home in America within 10 years.And we're also going to strengthen education at every level, starting with universal pre-K, and working -- working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code. And here's what I want all the students to hear, we're going to make college more affordable for everyone.You know, after our primary, which was hard-fought, and I was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues. Senator Sanders and I got together, came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.That's the vast majority of families. And if you're over that, we're going to make it debt-free. So pay what you can afford. But I don't want to see young people and their families going into debt. I view this as an investment. And that's why we're going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt -- pay it down and pay it off.And I also want more pathways to good jobs that don't require a four-year college de-gree. Let's return technical education to high schools. Let's do more with our community colleges. Let's have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job.And you know, in addition -- in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs, I want to make it fairer. That's why I want to raise the national minimum wage. If you work full-time, you shouldn't still be in poverty. And don't you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?And, you know, I always tell crowds, this is not a women's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister or a daughter working, it's your issue. And that's why we have got to get this fixed once and for all.And let's make childcare affordable. And let's have more profit sharing. And let's do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up. Now, you know, when I talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues, you know, Donald Trump or somebody always says, well, there she goes playing the woman card. And I've got to tell you, I don't believe that's what it is. I think we're paying -- playing the smart card.Because we want everybody's incomes to go up. That's how we're going to get this economy really moving forward, creating new jobs. And so if that's playing the woman card, you know what we say, deal me in.I've also said I will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year, because we don't need to do that. We can go where the money is, the millionaires and the billionaires, the corporations, to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy.We're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi- millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher.Now remember when we learned in one of the debates that Donald Trump hadn't paid any federal taxes?For about 20 years is the best guess we've got, and his excuse, I love his excuse, his excuse was well, he lost $1 billion in a year.I've been really pondering this. How does anybody lose $1 billion in a year, especially when you're running casinos? Think about it. Has anybody here ever been to a casino?Audience: Yes!Clinton: Well, you know, usually they say the house wins, so Donald Trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes. Well, if losing $1 billion is smart, I think that's kind of upside down and backwards. I think people should be working hard to make their incomes, to support their families, and that's what we're going to do because we don't want the kind of values that Donald Trump used in running his business to be in our government.He stiffs -- he stiffs small businesses. My dad was a small business owner. Donald Trump has refused to pay all kinds of folks, workers, small businesses installing drapes or marble or glass, or where he bought pianos, he didn't pay them. He just doesn't pay them and he gets away with it because he turns and he says to these small businesses well, go ahead and sue me.Well, my dad, because he was a small business man, I know he could never have afforded that, so I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, because our family would have been hurt by that.So here's the bottom line and here's what I need you to do. We have got to get everybody you know to turn out and vote, and you have early voting now and it's going to be much easier for some of you to vote early. And if you believe in any of the issues that we have talked about in this campaign, if you believe that women and girls should be treated with respect, if you believe that marriage equality should be protected.If you believe -- if believe in science and believe we should take action, if you believe America belongs to everybody willing to work for it and we should stand up against any kind of negative tax, then I hope you will come out and vote because it's going to be a close election. Pay no attention to the polls. Don't get -- don't get complacent, because we've got to turn people out.So I'm asking you to vote for me, I'm asking you to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate, I'm asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves, because really, that's what is at stake. So early voting began here in south Florida yesterday. It goes through Sunday, November 6th. You can go to your early voting site in your county between 7 AM and 7 PM. In fact, you can go across the street right now to the North Regional Library and cast your ballot today.And we have volunteers and staff ready to escort you, so hey, go ahead and vote now. And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make sure you have a plan to vote. But don't stop there. If you will join us in these next two weeks, every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference. So please, go to HillaryClinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text JOIN to 47246, and get involved, because the bigger the turnout, the bigger statement we will make about the kind of country we are and the future we want to build together.Now, let me just end by saying that people ask me all the time, you know, what moti-vates you, how do you do this day after day? And you know, look, I love this country, and I feel blessed. I feel blessed, and I want everybody to have the same chance to go after your part of the American Dream, and I think the American Dream is big enough for everybody.I think a lot about my two grandchildren, because obviously, I would do anything to help them, but it's not just them. I want to help everybody's children and grandchildren, because the kind of country we will have when they become adults will be affected by the decisions we make now on education, on healthcare, on ending the epidemic of gun violence, on getting the cost of prescription drugs down, on preserving and protecting Social Security and Medicare, doing what we must to make sure we're passing on a country that provides the same level of opportunity to all who come after us.So please join me. This is bigger than me, it's bigger than any of us. It's even bigger than Donald Trump, if you can believe it.This is a crossroads election that's going to determine so much about what kind of country we have in the decades ahead. I want to wake up in the White House with your help, making it my mission to do everything I can to give every person, and particularly every child, the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.If you will stand with me, if you will work with me over the next two weeks, let's go out and build the kind of future we want for ourselves, for our kids, and let's prove once and for all that love trumps hate.Thank you all very much.","UCSB"
"71",2016-10-27,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina","Hello, Winston-Salem! Hello Wake Forest! It is so great to be here in this beautiful city at this extraordinary time and to have a chance to be with so many, including the Wake Forest family. And it doesn't get any better than being here with our most amazing First Lady Michelle Obama. I want to thank everyone who has filled this arena, and I especially want to thank Dr. Hatch and the staff team and students at Wake Forest University. I will never forget being here with the legendary Maya Angelou, one of the most powerful voices our country has ever heard.So I couldn't think of a better place to come back to with another woman whose voice we need now more than ever. I want to say what I think is obvious but can't be said enough, and that is this may be one of the most, if not the most important election of our lifetimes, no matter our age. But for young people it will be so consequential because every election is about the future. And this one is about whether we build on the progress we've made, the legacy that President Obama has built or rip it away and go backwards. So we have a lot of work to do.And I don't mean just in the presidential race. Let's be sure to elect Roy Cooper, the next governor of North Carolina. He will always put the people of North Carolina first. And he will repeal HB2 – because he knows that discrimination is wrong. It's bad for business, and it's against North Carolina's values.And let's send Deborah Ross to the United States Senate. She will be an independent voice for the working families in this state, and she will help break through the gridlock in Washington.And unlike her opponent, Deborah Ross has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. And remember, it is not just Roy's name and Deborah's name or my name that's going to be on the ballot. So much of what we care about -- so much that's at stake in the election is, too.Voting rights are at stake. And if you care about this sacred right, and want to make sure our leaders of both parties do their part to protect and strengthen it -- not chip away at it, you've got to vote in this election. And so I hope, after all North Carolina has gone through with the efforts to suppress people's votes, you will turn out and say, ""No. We demand the right to vote.""And supporting our veterans is at stake. If you believe that America should stand with those who served because they served us, then you've got to vote. And so when you think about yourselves, your families, people you know who've worn the uniform of our country, the best way to make clear that we respect the military, and we will do everything we can to make sure they and their families have what they need as they sacrificed for us, is to show up and vote.And climate change is at stake. Now, I shouldn't have to say this in 2016, but I will. If you believe in science, right? And you know that climate change is real and demands action right now – you've got to show up and vote in this election.Immigration is at stake. If you believe that we need to fix our broken system, keep families together, and give people who love America a path to citizenship – you've got to vote.And marriage equality is at stake, too. If you believe everyone deserves to be treated equally in America, no matter who they are or who they love – then you've got to turn out and vote in this election.Good jobs that pay good wages are at stake. Investing in our roads and our bridges and our water systems and all the work that needs to be done in our country. That really matters, and we can put millions of people to work and have a more competitive economy. That's why we've proposed a very big jobs program, because I don't want anybody willing to work in this country not to have a good job with a rising income to support themselves and their families. If you believe that, then you've got to come out and vote.And particularly, for all of the students here, affordable college education is at stake. And not only that, relief from student debt that you already have is at stake. So if you believe as we do that everyone should be able to afford to go to college and graduate and that everyone should be able to pay down and pay off their debt, then you've got to get out and vote in this election.And dignity for women and girls. Again, I wish I didn't have to say this, right? But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election. And I want to thank our First Lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value. So I think you're getting the idea here that I think everything we care about is at stake in this election. So you've got to vote – and get your friends and families and neighbors to vote too.And don't just take it from me because I think you've heard some really compelling voices say the same thing, and one of them is here with us today, right? There are so many things I admire about our First Lady. Michelle reminds us to work hard, stay true to our values, be good to one another and never, ever stop fighting for what we believe in.She has spent eight years as our First Lady advocating for girls around the world to go to school and have the same opportunities as boys. She has worked for healthier childhoods for our kids here at home, better nutrition, more exercise. And we are seeing the results. We actually are seeing kids who are healthier, something that she was determined to try to achieve. She has encouraged more young people to go to college and follow your dreams, and she has supported America's military families, who serve and sacrifice as well for our country.Now, it hasn't been all hard work. She played a mean round of 'Carpool Karaoke,' and among the many real privileges I've had is to see the President and the First Lady dance. Wow, one could only hope. Now, she also planted an amazing vegetable garden at the White House – and I can promise you, if I win, I will take good care of it, Michelle.And boy – thank you! Boy, didn't she dazzle the world with that wise and beautiful speech at the Democratic National Convention this summer?And I have now, I have now stood on the debate stage for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, and if you see any of those debates, well, that has proved once and for all that I have the stamina to be President and Commander in Chief. But there were times during those three debates, the loop running in my head was what Michelle said at the convention, right? 'When they go low, we go high.'And on top of all that, just by being herself every day, never missing an opportunity to honor her parents for the hard work and sacrifice that set her on her way, she has shown every little girl and boy in America that there are no limits to what they can achieve if they work hard and do right and believe in themselves.Seriously – is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?And maybe, maybe it's especially meaningful to me because I do know something about being First Lady of the United States, and I'm going to state the obvious. It's not easy. You've got so many people counting on you. You've got the eyes of the world on you. And when you're trying to raise your children as she is and I did, and give them the space and support they need to have as normal and safe and fulfilling childhoods as possible – that makes it even harder. I used to hang out in the main hall on the second floor of the White House around the time Chelsea would come home from school just to be sure I got to see her and see what happened that day and try to figure out what I needed to be thinking about and doing for her.And let's be real – as our first African-American First Lady, she's faced pressures I never did. And she's handled them with pure grace. By any standard, she has been an outstanding First Lady who has made us all so proud.And she and the President, she and the President have been such wonderful friends to me and my family. It has just meant the world, the world to me, it really has.I want to say just one thing about the First Lady's work. I mentioned military families. She's been their fierce champion. And military families have come up against a lot in this election. It just made me boil when Donald Trump disrespected a Gold Star family, Mr. and Mrs. Khan. He still hasn't apologized to them.He actually made it worse – just yesterday, he said again that if America had only made him President years ago, their son, Captain Khan, would still be alive. Honestly, I don't -- I don't understand how anyone would want to rub salt in the wounds of a grieving family.And he keeps insulting our military. Yesterday, when he heard that a retired Army colonel and former dean of the Army War College said that Donald doesn't understand military strategy, Trump said, 'I'll teach him a couple things.' Well actually, Donald, you're the one who's got a lot to learn about the military and everything else that makes America great. Starting by learning about the dignity and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and their families. And he should learn from Michelle Obama how a leader supports them, not disrespects them!No one knows the stakes in this election better than our First Lady. Because all the progress that we've achieved under President Obama's leadership is at stake – he pulled our economy out of the biggest ditch that it was in when he became president. He saved the auto industry, he cracked down on Wall Street, he has tackled healthcare, climate change, civil rights, and so much else.And all the work that we've done to strengthen our relationships with other countries and secure our leadership in the world is also at stake.Now, I for one, and I hope all of you, do not want all that hard work – by our President and our First Lady and by millions of Americans – to be wiped away. We cannot let that happen.We've got to do everything in our power to get everyone out to vote. To understand no matter what issue you care about, it truly is on the ballot. Now, this has been a hard election at times. It's gotten pretty ugly, hasn't it? We've all felt it – especially our kids.I hear this from parents and children across our country – kids write me notes, they hand me little cards and notes when I shake hands with them. Their parents write to me, teachers talk to me. Kids are scared, kids are scared by the rhetoric they're hearing, right? I see the educators' heads nodding.Little girls hear the ugly things that have been said about women in this campaign, and it makes them feel terrible and doubt themselves – and that is why it is important for voices, like our First Lady's, to stand up and say, 'Wait a minute, respecting women and girls is so important,' and it is especially important for us to send that message to our children, boys and girls alike.Our kids are scared that they're going to be sent out of the country because their parents are immigrants or they're immigrants. They're scared if they're Muslim, or have a disability. I got a letter from a parent -- a mom from Wisconsin, I think, who adopted her son Felix from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He just turned 11 years old – he wrote my campaign to let me know he was now 11 years old. I love it when little kids do little birthday remembrances. America is the only country he's ever known. One day, he turned to his mom and asked, 'If Donald Trump becomes President, is he going to make me go back to Ethiopia?'Now that honestly breaks my heart. We've got to make sure all our kids know that America has a place for you -- the American Dream is big enough for you. And then, we've got to make sure they learn the right lessons about how to treat people. I saw that sign, I believe in love and kindness, right?Well, here's one place to start. We know that bullying is a real problem in our classrooms, our playgrounds and online – and teachers have reported that this election has made it worse. So I want you to know, we're going to launch a major new effort to help states and communities and schools and families end bullying wherever it takes places. And we will work together to make the internet a safer space for kids, invest in front-line professionals like guidance counselors and social workers and school nurses and psychologists to support kids who've been targeted, like the young woman I met in Iowa who told me she was bullied because of her asthma. This has got to stop. And I can't think of anything more important than making sure every single one of our kids knows that they loved just as they are.So ultimately, my friends, as Michelle reminded us this election is about our kids, and in my case, my grandkids. Their lives and their futures -- nothing is more important to me than that. I've been fighting for kids throughout my career. I will fight for them every single day of my presidency. So we have a job to do.Starting right now, let's come together. Let's work together. And let's be hopeful and optimistic and unified in the face of division and hate. Bring people together in a spirit of mutual respect to solve shared challenges. Let's have each other's backs, lift each other up, not tear each other down.Let's go out and win this election to make sure we do exactly that – for Roy Cooper, Deborah Ross, and all of us. Let's make sure you vote early. Vote as soon as you can, vote this afternoon. I'm excited about what we're going to see happen here in North Carolina, and I am so excited to be introducing our amazing First Lady Michelle Obama!","UCSB"
"72",2016-10-29,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the Dickerson Community Center in Daytona Beach, Florida","Go, Daytona Beach! Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. [Chants of ""Hillary.""] Thank you, all. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. I am just thrilled to be here. Are you I'm ready to canvass? Well, we need your help in these last 10 days until the election.I want to thank Leslie Pearce for that introduction and her lifelong work on behalf of children. I want to thank State Representative Dwayne Taylor and Mayor Derrick Henry for being here with us. And to all of the elected officials, all of the organizers and the volunteers, I am thrilled to have this chance to come by and talk with you for a few minutes about what's at stake in this election because this may be one of the most important elections in our lifetimes. And we cannot take anything or anyone for granted.I was just over at BCU for their homecoming celebration. And a lot of people told me they had already voted, but I said, 'Get your friends. Get your family. Get everybody you know to vote' because you've got early voting here in this county, in Volusia County, until November 5th. No excuses. Everybody's got to get out and vote. And that's what this canvass is meant to make sure we do. Right?Now, I'm sure that some of you may have heard about a letter that the FBI director sent out yesterday. Well, if you're like me, you probably have a few questions about it. It is pretty strange. It's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election. In fact, in fact, it's not just strange. It's unprecedented. And it is deeply troubling because voters deserve get to full and complete facts. And so we've called on Director Comey to explain everything right away, put it all out on the table. Right?Now, of course, Donald Trump is already making up lies about this. He is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people. I think it's time for Donald Trump to stop fear mongering, to stop disgracing himself, to stop attacking our democracy. We can't let him get away with this, can we?Now, like any campaign, there have been ups and downs and ups and downs, but I've got to tell you I feel so motivated, so excited, so ready because I've always stayed focused on one thing: you and your families. What I worry about are the problems that keep you up at night, and I'm going to stay focused on that, because you know on November 9th that's what's going to matter. We can't let this election in the last 10 days be about the noise and the distractions. It's got to be about what kind of country we want for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren – and who can help take us there as your president. [Chants of ""Hillary!""] Now, I think you and I agree the choice is pretty clear between a president who's ready to bring us together, keep us safe, and make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top, and someone who is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job.Now, I promise you this: I will never stop working for you every single day as a candidate and most importantly as your president. That's how I was raised. When I was over at B-CU I met one of the Methodist ministers because B-CU is affiliated with the Methodist Church, and I felt right at home. And my mother – my mother taught me to never, ever quit. Now what does that mean? Well, that means everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up. And I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now. We're just getting started.And let's always remember what our wonderful First Lady told us: 'When they go low, we go high.' So no matter what they throw at us in these last days, we're not going to back down. We're not going to get distracted. We're not going to get knocked off course. Because we know how much the election matters. We know how many people are counting on us. And that's why we're going to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision about America.We are going to stick together and we are going to win on November the 8th. Right? Because Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They've even said it in his campaign. It's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot – get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home too. Now, this is all part of his scorched earth campaign. It goes against everything we stand for. And you know how we stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout of voters in American history.We need more of everybody to vote – more women, more young people, more people of color, more African Americans, more Latinos, everybody. Let's break every record that we've ever had for voting. Let's make that the story of this election. And here in Florida you can, as you often have, make the difference. Right, Florida? If you all vote and you get everybody you know to vote, if you go out and talk to people today and every day about what's at stake in this election, then we will make history. We will win up and down the ballot. And I feel strongly about this, because we need people in Washington who are problem-solvers, not problem-makers. That's why I hope you'll vote to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate. He will be an independent voice for Florida families. And this is important: Unlike his opponent, Patrick has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.Now, here's some really good news. We just reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote. That is the highest number ever. And that includes 50 million young people. That's the most in history. And you know what else? More than 16.5 million people have already voted in this election. And more than 3 million of those votes have been right here in Florida. Now, you only see numbers like we're seeing here in Florida when people are standing up for what they really believe in. Americans are coming together, and I know because I hear from people who are Republicans and Independents who are joining us to reject hate and division, rejecting Donald Trump's demeaning treatment of women, his plans to break up immigrant families and deport millions of people, his lie that President Obama wasn't born in America.I'll tell you, we have learned who Donald Trump is. Now it's up to us to show who we are. And the energy that we are seeing is not just about what we're against, it's about what we're for. It's about a common vision that we share for a hopeful, dynamic, unified America where everyone counts, everyone has a place, everyone willing to work can get ahead and stay ahead, where women are respected – where veterans are honored, where workers are paid fairly, where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong.So my friends, it is not just the fact that my name will be on the ballot. Everything we care about is at stake – your future – making college affordable, helping you pay back your debt – the cost of prescription drugs down – protecting and defending Social Security and Medicare from privatization and Wall Street schemes. Fighting climate change is at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. In the end, we know that American dream itself is at stake.Now, did any of you see the debates?""Audience: ""Yes.""Clinton: ""Well, I'll tell you, I stood next to Donald Trump for three debates, four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief. But I have to tell you, he said a lot of things that were troubling. But in that last debate, he said something that was truly horrifying. He is the first person of a major party, Republican or Democrat, ever to refuse to say he would respect the outcome of the election. Now, we can think about every issue we care about, but you know, after attacking women and African Americans and Latinos and people with disabilities and Muslims and POWs and everybody, now he's attacking the institutions of democracy. And so it comes down to this. When your kids and grandkids ask, 'What did you do in the 2016 election when everything was on the line,' I want you to be able to say you voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.And the way we're going to do that: We're going to turn everybody out. Early voting has begun right here in Volusia County. Every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. until November 5th you can vote. The nearest early voting site is just one mile away from here at the Volusia County Library Center in City Island. So don't wait one more day. Go vote, and then help us get everybody else out to vote too.Now, I know – I know that we've got our canvass organizers up here. I don't want to take too much of their time because they are workers, they are organized, they are focused. I'm so grateful to them and to you, and we need you. We need you. Stakes couldn't be higher. We got to do everything we can. I don't want anybody waking up on November 9th and saying, 'Oh, I wish I had just done a little more.' So help us knock on doors, make phone calls, talk to voters, and ask them, 'When are you going to vote? Do you know where you're going to cast your ballot? Who will you take with you?' And make sure they know about early voting, already begun here in Florida. And then if you need to, sign up yourselves. We have signups for three more shifts between now and Election Day. And this is going to be a close election; they always are these days. And we're going to win because of you, because of hardworking volunteers like you. And if you know anybody thinking about voting for Donald Trump, stage an intervention. Remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump.And think about it this way. On January 20th, we're going to have a new president. And I'll tell you what, I will be proud to build on the progress we've made under President Obama and go even further. But I can't do any of the things that I'm talking about, any of the plans that I have, unless you help me. So that's what I'm asking you. That's why I came to Daytona Beach today. I came to ask you to help me in these last ten days. Let's give every American a chance to chart their own future, make their own contributions. Let's build a future we can all be proud of, and let's make sure we prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you.","UCSB"
"73",2016-10-30,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the Manor Complex in Wilton Manors, Florida","I am so excited to be here and I want to thank you. And you know I am really sorry and I know there are a lot of people outdoors who can't get in—so I want to give a big shout out to the overflow outside. I'm here with a lot of great people who are working so hard on this campaign. I want to thank Ken Evans. Thank you so much, Ken. I want to thank three members of Congress: Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz; Congressman Alcee Hastings; and your Congresswoman Lois Frankel. I also want to thank Sheriff Israel for being here. And Mayor Resnick just gave me a key to the city of Wilton Manors. And I want to thank my longtime friend and such a great leader, Chad Griffin, Human Rights Campaign president. I know that Chad told me there are a bunch of Human Rights Campaign organizers. And as I've said many times, HRC for HRC sounds good to me.Well, my friends, just nine days left until November the 8th. Nine days that really will determine the outcome of the most important election of our lifetimes. And we cannot take anyone or anything for granted. It's great to be here at the Manor Complex, a place that means so much to so many. And there have been ups and downs in all that we've gone through over the years, and even in this campaign, but I want you to know I am focused on one thing: you – your lives, your futures. The problems that keep you up at night. That's what I'm interested in, and that's what I'm going to be talking about here today and throughout the next nine days.That's really what this election is about. There's a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want and who, as our president, can help us get there. So I want you to know – now, I just have to say I know I'm preaching to the choir. But I also, through you, want to talk to people who are still making up their minds, believe it or not, right? Because we've got a choice between a president who will bring us together, keep our country safe, get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top – or someone who's temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job. You know, Donald Trump is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people. I mean, he's such a downer, right? And it's time for him to stop fear mongering, stop distracting from what's really at stake, and frankly, stop disgracing our democracy. We can't let him get away with this.But here's the good news. Yes, America is great, and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals. But we are seeing Americans coming together – Democrats, Republicans, independents – to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision of our country. And it's going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days what's at stake. Because I really believe the vast majority of Americans agree with us. We don't want a president who demeans women. We don't want a president who has plans to break up and deport immigrant families. We don't want a president who perpetrated the lie that President Obama wasn't born in America. We don't want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality. But I want you to know, the energy we're now seeing out in the campaign is not just about what we're against, it's also about what we're for. Because we also share a common vision. Beyond partisanship and politics, it's a hopeful, inclusive America where everyone counts and everyone has a place, right?And that's exactly what I'm going to be fighting for in these last nine days. We're going to honor people, not insult them. Donald Trump has insulted more than half of our population. African Americans, Latinos, immigrants, Muslims, POWs, women. And by what he has said, so many others who believe that you have a positive future. I agree with that: you do. And I promise you this: I'm going to keep working every single day for you and for the vision of America that we share.Now, I will tell you, my mom taught me to never, ever quit, and what does that mean? Well, that means –""Audience Member: ""Rise up.""Clinton: ""You got it. You got it. And it also means when you're knocked down, what matters is whether you get up again. I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life. I'm not stopping now. We're just getting warmed up, right? And we won't be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us. We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters, and we know how many people are counting on us. So we're going to take to heart the words of our wonderful First Lady, Michelle Obama: When they go low, we go high.We're going to keep our foot on the gas because Donald Trump's strategy is real simple. They've even said it in his campaign. Here's his strategy about how he's going to win: Get women to stay home. Get young people to stay home. Get people of color to stay home. Get the LGBT committee to say home. It's all part of his scorched earth campaign, and it goes against everything we stand for. So you know how we're going to stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout in American history.We need everybody to turn out and vote – women, young people, people of color, the LGBT community, Latinos, African Americans, Americans from all walks of life. Let's break every single record. Let's make that the story of this election. And here's some really good news. This is amazing. More than 20 million people have already voted in this election, most of those votes in the last few days, 3 million of those votes from right here in Florida. Now, you only see numbers like that when people are standing up for what they really believe in. So if all of you vote, if your friends, your family, your coworkers vote, if everyone you talk to between now and Election Day votes, we are going to make some really big history on November the 8th.And I want you not only coming out for me. I want you to reelect our members of Congress. And please elect Patrick Murphy to the Senate. And if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election, listen to this. We've heard some outrageous things in this campaign. I'm sure we'll hear more in the next nine days. But I got to tell you, I was beginning to think that nothing we learned about Donald Trump could surprise me anymore.But yesterday the Washington Post published a report that was truly stunning. It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York. Now, let me say, this is important in part to remember. This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS. So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school, and all the kids and their families, for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine. Because you know, back in the '90s, some of you remember. Right? Children weren't welcomed in school.And then, unannounced and uninvited, guess who barges in? Donald Trump. He walks right up to the stage. He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation. None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there. He wasn't a donor at all. He had never given a single dollar to help build the school. He just wanted people to think he had. So he sat on the stage through the program, even posed for photographs, and when it was over, he got up and walked out. No explanation. No donation. Now really, who does that? What kind of person does that? Really? I mean, who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good? Well, I'll tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.Back in 1997, he was principal for a day at a public school. That was a program we used to have in New York. The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament. They were $5,000 short. He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill. At first the kids and their parents were excited. Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke. So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine. Now, this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trump's behavior, called the school, and donated the $5,000. And the coach remembers this woman saying, ""I am ashamed to be the same species as this man.""Now, I got to say, any of you see the debates? Well, you know, I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job. Right? But a lot of what we've heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern. And here's what the Washington Post concludes. 'For as long as he has been rich and famous, he has wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public, even nationally televised promises, to give his own money away. It was in large part a faзade.' And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other people's giving as his own.Now, of course, because he's refused to release his tax returns, we don't even know if he's ever given anything. But here's what we do know. With Donald, it's always Donald Trump first and everyone else last. He abuses his power. He games the system, and he doesn't care who's left holding the bag.And here's what else we know. Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights. And this election will determine whether we continue the progress we've made or let it be ripped away. We know Trump has promised he'll appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obama's executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination. And just this week, a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees. It's a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trump's golf courses. So I want you just to think.This guy works hard. Works with his hands. Probably there 12 hours a day, maybe more, when it's the summer season. After he told his coworkers he was gay, they started harassing him. They called him names. They even threw rocks and golf balls at him. It got so bad he ended up in the hospital. Now, his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing. So finally he went to the police for help. He was too scared even to come back to work. And what did the Trump golf course do? They fired him.Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day. And it's deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior, Trump's business punished the victim for coming forward. Now, if that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does it say about how he would run our country? We've made a lot of progress on LGBT rights, but as that story reminds us, we still have work ahead, don't we?There is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT, or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant, and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday, post your Facebook photos on Sunday, and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love. So here's what I'll do as president. We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act. And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives. We'll work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach. And we will take on homelessness, bullying, and violence, particularly youth homelessness, which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids. And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy. LGBT kids don't need to be cured of anything. They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected. And yes, we're going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in Orlando can never happen again.Now, some of you know, Chad Griffin and others know, this issue is really important to me. I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. I saw how countries around the world treated lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. And I believe with all my heart America has to lead by example. I want – I want LGBT people in every corner of our country – because don't forget you all living in Wilton Manors have moved far away from a lot of the places where people are still scared today. Right? And we're going to elevate this issue. We're going to talk about it. We're going to reach out.So when you vote in this election, remember, it's not just my name on the ballot. It's your future. It's who we are as a country. It's every issue we care about. And make no mistake: LGBT rights are at stake. Dignity and respect for every American is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake.I believe when the middle class thrives, Americans thrive. And we're going to make America the clean-energy superpower of the 21st Century, too. And if we're serious about supporting a middle class, we're going to be supporting families.The other day, I was in Pittsburgh. And there was a woman there with her young child. We've got some folks from Pittsburgh. She was shaking Tim Kaine's hand. And she said to him, ""I came here hoping I could tell you or Secretary Clinton I had my baby three years ago. And the next day, I was fired. It had been a difficult pregnancy. I called to ask if I could take a little time to recover, and the answer was 'No. Don't come back at all.' Nobody, no parent, should ever have to make that kind of choice, but that's also true when we talk about paid family leave, caring for a spouse or a partner, caring for an elderly relative.I want us to recognize the way we live today. It is no longer the 1950s. We need to support people who are part of committed relationships, of families, of marriages, and give everybody the support you need to actually do what's the most important thing in life. And that is caring for each other. We're going to do everything we can to catch up to the rest of the world: affordable childcare, paid family leave, earned sick days, jobs with rising incomes. We're going to raise the national minimum wage. No one who works full-time should have to raise a family in poverty.And yes, we're going to guarantee equal pay for women's work. We're going to make sure. We're going to make sure that we not only grow the economy but we make it fairer. And I've got to tell you that's such a stark contrast with Trump. He believes if you give the biggest tax cut in American history to the wealthy – that's with trillions of dollars going to the top – that will somehow trickle down. It hasn't worked. It won't work. I believe that we could grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And that's exactly what we're going to do.So, my friends, we've got a guy who won't pay his income tax. I mean, I've got to just say when we learned in the debate that he lost a billion dollars and that meant that he didn't pay income tax for like 20 years, he said that was smart. And I thought to myself, how smart do you have to be to lose a billion dollars? I mean, really. And what kind of genius are you to lose a billion dollars while running casinos? But it's serious because it means he's paid zero, zero for our military, our vets, for healthcare, for Pell Grants, for our universities, our colleges, our highways. This is Trump to a T.The stories that I told you about him showing up and acting like he's done something, well, he shows up and criticizes our country. He shows up and discriminates against African Americans when he was denying them the right to rent apartments. He chose to make his products in other countries, not America. He's built a career on stiffing small businesses. I take that personally. My dad was a small business owner. I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump.So, my friends, we've got work to do. And let's get to that work. We've got to make sure that we get everybody out to vote. I want you to be able to say on November 9th you voted for a better future, you voted for a better America. And look how easy it is. It is so easy. Wilton Manors City Hall is just a half a mile down the street from where we are right now. And if you are registered in Broward County, you can go to any early-vote location in the county from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. all week. And if you have been mailed your ballot, make sure you fill it out and mail it back today. You can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. And make sure you have a plan to vote.But, please, also help us in these last nine days. Every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference. So go to hillaryclinton.com. Sign up to volunteer. Take out your phone. Text 'JOIN,' J-O-I-N, to 47246. I don't want anybody waking up on Wednesday morning and seeing the results and getting depressed. I'm against depression. We don't want that to happen in this election. Right?""Audience: ""No!""Clinton: ""I don't want people to be sad because they didn't do their part. We can't let that happen. And I have to ask you if you – if you know anybody, if you know anybody, who is thinking about voting for Trump, you've got to stage an intervention. Do everything you can to try to convince that person that they surely care about something that Donald Trump is on the wrong side of because I can guarantee you they do because, after all, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. Right?So I am so grateful to all of you. Have many of you have already voted? Okay. So, now, how many of you will help us get somebody else to vote? That's what's going to make the difference. Change is coming. Let's make sure it's the right kind of change. The choice is yours. We're going to do everything we can to build a stronger, better, fairer America, coming together, healing the divides among us. And we're going to prove, once and for all, that love trumps Hate. Thank you.","UCSB"
"74",2016-10-31,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Smale Riverfront Park in Cincinnati, Ohio","Secretary Clinton: ""Thank you so much! Wow, it is great to be back in Cincinnati. What a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river. I am grateful to all of you. I am thrilled to be here with my dear friends Mark and Gabby, and with all of you, because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes.Are you ready to work hard in this election and win it? Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate? I've known Ted a long time. He is a champion for workers and families. He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages. And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done, breaking through the gridlock in Washington. And this is important: unlike his opponent, Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.I also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials, including my friend, the Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, from across the river in Kentucky. And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today. I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work, to do everything they can to help save lives in America.You know, as Gabby says every day when she goes out, fight, fight, fight. And fight she does. She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together – to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children, our fellow men and women, our country. And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans, including a majority of gun owners, to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures. And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner.You know, you go through life, you go through the campaigns, there are ups and there are downs. And my mother, who had a really difficult life, she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign. Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up. And throughout this campaign, I have stayed focused on one thing: you – your lives, your families, the problems that keep you up at night. Because that's really what this election is all about. It's not about the noise and the distractions. It's about what kind of country we want for our kids, and what kind of president can help get us there.I have so much that I want to do with you on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America. And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election.Now, earlier today, I was up at Kent State, a great university, and I told them about some of the reasons why I think it's really important to get everybody out to vote in this election. But I started by saying that there's this new email story about – why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That's a really good question. But I want you to know – look, I've said repeatedly I made a mistake, I'm not making any excuses, but I will tell you this. If they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers, by all means, go ahead, look at them. And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year, right? It wasn't even a close call, and I think most people have moved on. They're looking and focused on, okay, who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief?Did any of you see the debates? Any of you see the debates? Well, I am – I got a little bit of a chance. I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job. But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service, my plans for our country, what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do, and then weigh that against my opponent, what he's done and said. I am running against someone who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, ""Then why are we making them?"" He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. He's mentioned Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Now, if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas, remember this. When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because, and I quote, ""I have a very good brain."" He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. [Booing.] No, Donald, you don't. And of course, the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin, and their allies.So in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election. Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.I have to tell you, it does not give me any pleasure saying that. It's not a small thing. I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president, both Republicans and Democrats. And look, I've had my disagreements with Republicans. I might have disagreed on policies or principles, but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office. Donald Trump is different, and that's why there is so much at stake in this election. He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges – the challenge posed by slavery – and we fought a civil war. But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together.I will tell you this. I want to bring not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents, people who vote for me and people who vote against me, together. Because I have a very different vision of America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive. It's big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not putting them down. It's a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together. And America is great because America is good. Never forget that. Yes, we have our flaws; of course, we're only humans. But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world. So we want an America where women are respected – where our veterans are honored – where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly. And we believe in an America where marriage is a right, and discrimination is wrong. An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, and the American dream is big enough for everybody. So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher.When I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck. It was a very big crowd, and it was primarily students. And I thought to myself, well, I'm not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security. And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys. A launch officer. And he came out for me, along with now more than 30 launch officers, and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys.And even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother him. ""Good luck. Enjoy yourselves, folks,"" is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he even knows that a single – a single – nuclear warhead can kill millions of people? That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should, and I quote, ""not have his finger on the button."" And when it comes to handling a crisis, we've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation – when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he's challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protestor at a rally, when he's confronted by his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. [Cries of ""No!""] Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. I hope you'll think about that when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world, and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren.And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America. As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns. Thousands more are injured. It's an average of 90 people a day dying. Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes. We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. And we've seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men. And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others. I've had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement.But here's what I want to say. If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute. This can't go on. We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time. And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period.And look. There is a very clear difference. Donald Trump won't stand up to the gun lobby. He's sold out to them. In fact, the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group, more than $7 million in Ohio alone. And in return, Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obama's actions to strengthen criminal background checks. Donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol. He's even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms. How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?So I have stood up to the gun lobby for years, which is why they are running all of these ads against me. And I will stand up to them as president. I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because we've got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives.I will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you, whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people, to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. That's how I was raised. I was raised to believe that if you work hard – and I believe in hard work – you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. And I will never ever quit on you. When I tell you I'm going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life, I don't care what the political or other barriers are. We're going to find a way over, under, around, or through until we get it done. I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now. Remember, when our opponents go low, we go high. We're not going to be distracted. We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters. And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count.Now, the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple. They've announced it. Their strategy is: get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, and get people of color to stay home. It's all part of his scorched-earth campaign, but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it. And it goes against everything we stand for. So if you're as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run, the things he has said, insulting not just women but immigrants, Latinos, African Americans, prisoners of war, Muslims, veterans, the military – I mean, the list goes on and on. It's almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does.So you know the best way to stop him: by showing up with the biggest turnout in history. We need more Americans to vote. And I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote because we're already seeing record turnout. Twenty-three million people have already voted in this election. And more than one million of them are right here in Ohio. There is no doubt if we vote, we win. So, please, if you haven't voted early, please do so. And please get your friends and your family, everybody you know to vote. Take people to vote with you. Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there.Make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun. And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because, make no mistake, whatever issue you care about – I've only mentioned a few tonight, but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot. Now, it may be my name and my opponent's name, but where we stand on these issues, what we've done in the past, what we have said we want to do in the future, that is all on the ballot. The future of our economy is at stake, of our education system is at stake. Fighting climate change and clean, renewable-energy jobs are at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. Actually, in the end, the American dream itself is at stake. So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th. Audience Member: Happy.Secretary Clinton: Happy. I think that's the right answer. But just suppose, just suppose you go to bed early. Suppose you go to bed early. Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn't make calls or knock on doors. I want you to imagine. So you get up early on the morning of the 9th. And you log on to the news to find out, hey, what's going on, or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio, and you hear. Audience Member: No!I want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because I prefer for us to be motivated by what we're for, not what we're against. But I also think it's prudent to imagine what could happen if we don't do our part. And when in the future somebody asks you, maybe your kids or your grandkids, 'What did you do when everything was on the line?' I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.'Let's go out and, in these next eight days, do everything we can to make it clear we're going after the kind of future that includes everybody. We're going to build this economy: new jobs, rising wages. We're going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt. We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids. So if we build that future together, we will be able to say we were part of making sure that America's best days are still ahead of us. And we will prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate.Thank you all.""","UCSB"
"75",2016-10-31,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the Kent State Student Recreation Center in Kent, Ohio","Hello, Kent State! And Happy Halloween everybody! It's great to be back in Ohio – even if, even if the World Series is making life very stressful for Cubs fans everywhere. I want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction, and for his service to our nation. I think every American should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote. I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program. In particular, let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown, such a great senator, my dear friend and great congressman Tim Ryan, State Representative John Boccieri, State Representative Kathleen Clyde, and let me thank the Kent Clarks, the acapella group that sang during the pre-program! My friends, we are about to enter the final week of this election, so I wanted to come back to Ohio, one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country, to talk about what's at stake in this election. But let me start with this. I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That's a good question! And first of all, for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand and as I've said, I'm not making excuses. I said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means, they should look at them. And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year. There is no case here. And they said it wasn't even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this. Now what people are focused on is choosing the next President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America. And did any of you see the debates? Well, I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country. And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said. I am running against a man who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, 'Then why are we making them?' And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East. And if you're telling yourself he'll surround himself with smart people who'll stop these crazy ideas, remember this: When he asked who he consults on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because he said and I quote, 'I have a very good brain.' He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. No, he does not. And of course, the people Donald Trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia -- Vladimir Putin and Putin's allies. So, in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future. I started saying last June, I believe, that Donald Trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. And I've got to tell you, I did not take any pleasure in saying that. I have known, I have known for years now people who ran for President, Republicans and Democrats. And I had my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats, but I never doubted their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. That's as serious as it gets. So today, I want to talk about our national security. Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions. And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election. And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace? How do you handle a crisis? And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? We'll start with nuclear weapons. Now, I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don't think so and in part of what you just heard from Bruce Blair. When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should, and I quote, 'not have his finger on the button,' then this is a topic that can't be avoided. And as I've said, Donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons. He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world, the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it -- or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that can't be stopped. And when a few more countries go nuclear, their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well. One of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and I am proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program. But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump. 'Good luck, enjoy yourselves, folks,' was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people. These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. To talk so casually, so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling. President Ronald Reagan once said -- and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union -- and he once said he feared, and this is a quote from President Reagan, 'some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us.' That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the Atomic Age. So what would he think about Donald Trump, who says he wants to be, and I quote, 'unpredictable' about using the most powerful weapons ever produced? And here's the thing with nuclear weapons – as Bruce told you, when the President gives the order, that's it. There's no veto for Congress, no veto by the Joint Chiefs. The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire. And that can take as little as four minutes. That's why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal. Earlier you heard from one of them, Bruce Blair, and his story is worth remembering. In 1973, Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana. His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the President ever gave the order. Then one night in October, as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East, the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war. Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world, Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty. They unlocked the safe, took out the launch codes and the keys, and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them. Then they waited for the final order from the President. Thankfully, it never came. But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump, and sees his hair-trigger temper, and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night. As I've said many times, a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. And that brings me to the second question I think voters should pose to both candidates: How do you handle a crisis? We've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. When he's confronted with his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. Imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesn't want to hear, racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet. And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. Now thankfully, he's never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country. But there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself. Donald is a New Yorker, and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruz's attacks in a debate. And then he invoked the days after 9/11, when New Yorkers really came together and took care of each other. And I couldn't agree more. That's why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9/11. After the world watched with horror as the Twin Towers fell, he called in to a New York TV station. And even on that horrible day, when thousands of people lost their lives, he couldn't stop himself from pointing out that now, because the towers had fallen, a building he owned was now the tallest in Lower Manhattan. What kind of a person brags at a moment like that? I'll tell you: someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as Commander in Chief. For me, I take this very personally, my friends. Because I was one of New York's senators along with Chuck Schumer on 9/11. He and I were on the ground the very next day, meeting with the Governor, the Mayor, emergency officials. And I will never forget the sight of Ground Zero. The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see. Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers. They had all lost friends. In a makeshift command center, we were briefed on the damage, and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York, and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York but to keep America safe. That's what I did for eight years as a senator. I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed. And I think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that. Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted. They happen. I'll tell you a quick story. It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration. And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room. And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table, and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side. And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration. So even before we were sworn in to do our jobs, we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision. It really matters what your experience has, what your values are, whether you can be counted on to make that decision. You learn a lot about people in moments like that. And as I sat there with the pressure on, having to think through in my own head, how we evaluated this intelligence, how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African American president on the Mall in Washington. We made the decision to go forward, obviously. Some of you might have been there. But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there. So you have to ask yourself: in a crisis, who would you trust? Who will listen to good advice, keep a level head and make the right call? Because that's the person you want as our president and Commander in Chief. Now let's get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us. Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? Now this may seem like an easy question. If you got it on an exam, I think you'd be able to answer it. But apparently it's hard for Donald. He has picked fights with our friends. I mean the President of Mexico, the British prime minister, the German chancellor, pretty much the entire nation of Japan… and he even picked a fight with the Pope. And at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership. He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square. Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia. He has called NATO, quote, 'obsolete.' Obsolete? NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. And it's based on something called Article V, which says, 'An attack on one is an attack on all.' And Article V has only been invoked one time: when our allies came to our defense after 9/11. We still have NATO allies fighting side by side, working side by side with American troops in Afghanistan. They joined us in going after Al Qaeda and Bin Laden. Now we're supposed to tell them we won't have their back? And by the way—right now, our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe. They're hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere. And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops, they share the risks and burdens. Now they're moving into the Baltic States to deter Russian aggression. Treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City – hanging them out to dry -- would make our country and our world less safe. And it would play right into the hands of Russia and China, which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail. But maybe that's the point. Because what's most striking about all of this -- and I would argue most important for voters to consider – is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. As former Secretary Madeleine Albright put it, and I quote her, 'We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.' Michael Morell, who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here, has said that Putin is manipulating Donald. Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB. He knows he can use flattery to get into Donald's head -- to make Donald the Kremlin's puppet. And It seems to be working. Donald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants, from Ukraine to Syria and beyond. He's even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama. And it gets worse. The U.S. intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government, which means Putin, is directing cyber-attacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election. So ask yourself, why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected President? Could it be because of all of the nice things Donald has said about him, or the fact that he's promised to adopt pro-Kremlin policies, or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin? Since Donald still won't release his tax returns, and don't hold your breath, we don't know the full extent of his business relationships --but what we do know is disturbing. And we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country. A foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election. That should scare everyone, Democrat, Republican, and Independent. With the election just eight days away, this can't wait any longer. Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates. The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election. When you step back and take it all in, it's no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump, because he would be – in their words – 'the most reckless President in American history.' It's no surprise that not a single former President, Secretary of State or Defense, or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him. It's no surprise that Bob Gates, who served eight presidents over 50 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, has said Trump is, and I quote, 'beyond repair… stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government… temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform… unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.' I hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead -- and how we want to secure the safety of our country, our children and our grandchildren. And who is best to do that. So make no mistake, that really is what is on the ballot this year. It's not just my name and Donald Trump's name. It's our future. Our security. Our values. It's who we are as a country. Donald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. But the good news is: There's another vision for America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified. And it is big-hearted, not small-minded. It's about lifting people up, not tearing each other down. It's a vision that says, as I believe in my heart that we are stronger together. Millions of people across our country are standing up and saying: We believe in an America that is great because it is good. That is Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Because we believe in an America where women are respected. An America where veterans are honored, parents are supported, and workers are paid fairly … an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong…. an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values… where everyone counts and everyone has a place. Where the American dream is big enough for everyone. This goes way beyond policies and partisanship. We're talking about what it really means to be an American in the 21st century. About the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls, kids and grandkids. It turns out, if you dig deep enough, through all the mud of politics, eventually you hit something hard and true. A foundation of fundamental values that unite us as Americans – basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency. That's something to defend – and to build on. And, in the end, that's what this election is all about. Here in Ohio, you can make the difference. Early voting has already begun. So now is the time. Every phone call you make, every door you knock, moves us forward. You can go to hillaryclinton.com, and sign up to volunteer. Or text J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6 to do the same. Sometimes -- if you have studied history -- you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time. This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States. And it truly is in your hands, as it should be. When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you will be able to say: I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America. A place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of America are still ahead of us. Particularly young people who I believe absolutely should help make that future! So let's come together, let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an America that we believe in because that America believes in us. And we are going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you.","UCSB"

I'm also delighted that we're joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace.I also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly. And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton [inaudible] for his pledge of allegiance. And thanks to all the elected officials here. And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!It's almost hard to believe, isn't it? There are only seven days left in this election.So are you ready to vote?Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days?I hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick, who's been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families. And I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.Now somebody asked me the other day, 'Why do you keep coming back to Florida?' Just look around folks. I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it's also really important in this election. Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world. And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what's at stake in this election. Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes.One week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States. I don't think the choice could be any clearer. I have spent my career fighting for children and families. I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice. I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike. I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president.Now, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent. And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons.When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, 'Well then why are we making them?'And I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president. And what he told the crowd — it was a big crowd at Kent State University — I think every voter should hear. Basically — his name was Bruce Blair — he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal. There is no veto. And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say, 'We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.' And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities.So when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot.So is immigration. Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working, raising their families, as he has suggested he will do? I don't think so. I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less. I don't think that's right.Now maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war. We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.Or maybe for some of you, it's what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University. And so Trump said, 'Well, we can't trust him because his parents were born in Mexico.' Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called — well, but wait a minute, — he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, 'The definition of a racist comment.'And then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our country, simply because that family was Muslim.And then let's not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced. Honestly if this were something new, I think we'd all be asking ourselves, 'Well, what does he have against President Obama?' Or what does he have against me? But this is not new. I know I'm reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans.And here's what I want you to tell. I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan. He said, 'Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.' So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama – literally better than anybody, I guess. And, when you think about it, what he said at the convention, 'I alone can fix it,' runs counter to who we are as Americans. We work together.So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president. But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because – Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States. And during those debates, Donald always used to say, 'What have you been doing for 30 years?' And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out. And so I've been a lawyer, and I've been a first lady, and I've been a senator, and I've been Secretary of State, and I've been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I've been a woman.And when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he's been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women. And, I've got to tell you, some of what we've learned – some of this stuff is very upsetting. I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we're going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. How we're going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university. And if you're above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it.But I can't just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds. This is a consequential choice, so we've got to talk about something that, frankly, is painful, because it matters. We can't just wish it away. And a lot of his supporters don't like to hear this. I don't blame them. If I were supporting him, I wouldn't want to hear it either, to be honest. But I've got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it's not okay to insult people. It's not okay.And look at what he does. He calls women 'ugly,' 'disgusting,' 'nasty' all the time. He calls women 'pigs,' rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10. We just heard from Alicia. She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant. Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her 'Miss Piggy.' He called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she's a beautiful Latina. He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise. Now, he also said, 'This is somebody who likes to eat.' Well, I have to say: who doesn't like to eat? I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?But you've got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And, I'll tell you who: a bully, that's who. And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down. She knows that Donald Trump doesn't get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends.But what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence, their sense of self-worth? If you've got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to.Not so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl. And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable, and I'm doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson. Because, let's be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite – they don't look right, they're not thin enough, they don't act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be. Right?And I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that's there for her to come home from school. And sometimes, we only had a few minutes together. But before she'd run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out how was the day. We'd talk about what was on her mind. And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them. And we want them to be strong, and we don't want them to feel bad about themselves. And we've got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down – lifting people up and respecting women.In fact, all of us should respect each other in our country. So, when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission. I want them to know they're love, they're cared for, they're respected. I want them to develop a good work ethic. I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world. But that's what I want for every child. I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families. It will be the mission of my presidency. I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?So I know there's work to be done. We can't do it with just words alone. We've got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified. And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women. I'm not going to repeat it. But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women, mistreating women. And I have to tell you, since that tape came out, twelve women have come to say that, 'What he said on that tape is what he did to me.'And then we heard his response. What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting them. He said he couldn't possibly have said those things because the women weren't attractive enough to assault. 'Look at her,' he said about one woman. 'I don't think so.' About another, he said, 'She wouldn't be my first choice.'He's also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed. He said he did that — he said he did that to 'inspect' them. That was his word – and he said, 'I sort of get away with things like that.' And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, 'Yes, that's exactly what he did to us.' Now, as bad as that is, he didn't just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant. He's also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant. Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing. Some of them were just 15 years old.We cannot hide from this. We've got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trump's words have shaken her to her core.For a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that's brought back painful memories. And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it's been shocking to see this. He tried to explain it away as 'locker room talk,' well, I'll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, 'Not in our locker rooms. That does not happen.'Well, I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.And I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.He doesn't look at us and see full human beings, with our dreams and purposes, our own capabilities. And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign.Well, he's very wrong. He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country. He has shown us who he is. Let us on Tuesday show him who we are. We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said. He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry. Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder.Well, I have a message for him. We're going to fight for affordable childcare. We're going to fight for equal pay for all people. We're going to fight for paid family leave, we're going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and that's important because so many people still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid. And that's especially true for minimum wage workers — who — two-thirds of whom are women, so we've got work to do my friends. I'm excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be. Because instead of Donald Trump's dangerous and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful and unifying.But I can't do any of this without your help. Early voting has already begun. Almost 26 millions Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida. Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together. And voting on all the issues that they care about. It may be my name and Donald's name on the ballot but everything you care about, our security, our economy, bringing our country together, the environment, clean water and clean air!Here in Dade City, you can vote every day from now until November 5th, from 7am to 7pm.In fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes' drive away. You can go there right after this rally and vote. Because, we need everybody to stand up in this election.And if you have a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today.Don't wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers.Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple– he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting, people of color from voting, that is a lot of people. By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are.Now I know here in this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump. And here is what I want to ask you, I want you to talk with them. Ask them what they care about. Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy. Because Donald Trump's economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250,000 a year.So there could not be, no matter what you care about, a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump, and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days.We are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls, knocking on doors, it really matters, turn out matters.Please go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved. Here is what I want to leave you with. You know, I feel like so many of you, our country is already great but we can make is greater. The main reason America is great is because America is good. We are a big hearted, generous people. Not a small minded people. We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign. But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance. For America, this is one of those make or break elections. It really is in your hands.I hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November 9th. are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us? And I hope, I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference, I want to be your partner as well as your president, I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren. That is what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America. Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!Thank you all.","UCSB"
"77",2016-11-03,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Coastal Credit Union Music Park in Raleigh, North Carolina","Thank you. Wow! Thank you all. Woo!Thank you. Thank you. I -- I got to -- I got to say, after hearing -- after hearing from these two extraordinary men I -- I feel all fired up and ready to go for the next five days.It is so great to be back here with all of you, and there are a few people in the audience that I just want to acknowledge because I'm delighted they're there -- U.S. Congressman David Price I saw right there.Thank you, David.State Senator Dan Blue Jr., I know, right there. Thank you, Dan.And I'm not sure she's still here, but Deborah Ross, who I hope is your next senator. There she is!Because everything Pharrell and Bernie just said is not only about the presidential election and what's at stake, it is about who's going to represent you as your governor, as your senator, as members of Congress and the legislature, and you have some excellent candidates. And we are so hopeful that you will vote for them and vote for what they represent.Now, I really want to thank my friend, Bernie Sanders, for everything that he has done.I -- I got to serve with Bernie. We were colleagues in the Senate. I saw firsthand his commitment to the people of Vermont and to the values that have guided his life. And when we faced each other in the primary, here's what I was so proud about. We ran a campaign on the issues that matter to the American people.And I -- I think because of that campaign, we were able to raise a lot of the issues that you heard Bernie talking about to the level that they are part of this presidential cam-paign, and they will be part of our agenda after January 20th, Bernie.And I've got to say, too, this election has been a lot more fun now that we're on the same side.And I want to thank Bernie for everything he's done. He's crisscrossing our country, energizing people, getting folks off the sidelines and engaged in politics. And there's no question that his efforts are paying off.And what he said at the beginning of his remarks is absolutely true. My name may be on the ballot, but it is not about me, it's not about my opponent, it's not about Bernie, it's not about David or Deborah, it is about you and your lives and what we're going to do together.Now, Bernie and I have already worked, we've worked on the plan that he told you about to make college tuition-free for the middle-class, for working families, for poor kids and debt-free for everyone.Because as Bernie said earlier this year, when people who care about progressive causes stand together, we win, and then we can get to work on making those causes into realities for the lives of our people. So I am proud to be here with you and I am so excited about -- of the election, about everything that we're going to do together.And I'm especially pleased to have Pharrell here.Now, every time I see him, which is not often enough, we always have a good conversation like we did before this event. He always gets you to think. Not only is he a world-class talent, but he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often overlooked and ignored. He wants to -- and I'm going to do everything I can help him -- to deliver -- giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child.So tell me this, tell me this, North Carolina, tell me, North Carolina, are you really, really, really happy that we're here tonight?Well, we sure are. There's nowhere we'd rather be.Now, let me ask you this, how many of you have already voted?Well, I hope you're going to bring more people to vote as well, right?Are you ready to volunteer?We can all use you in these last days. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper?Well, I'm glad to hear that because it's time you had a governor who puts families first, not radical ideology.And I love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of North Carolina.Now, are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? I'll tell you -- I'll tell you, Deborah and her race are the talk of everywhere. People know she will be an independent voice for North Carolina families, that she will represent you with integrity and excellence. And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.Are you ready now to choose our next president and commander-in- chief?Well, I'm -- I'm excited. Did any of you see the debates?Well, you know, there's several -- there's several notable aspects of those debates.I mean, one is the very fact that I stood on the stage for four and a half hours with my opponent proving, once and for all, I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief.But you know -- but you know, he -- he also kept saying, like oh, well you know, what have you done for the last 30 years? And you know, occasionally I would interject and say what I had done.And today, in Greenville, we had a perfect comparison. I started my career fighting for children and families with the Children's Defense Fund when I got right out of law school in the 1970's.I went to South Carolina to gather evidence to stop the government in South Carolina for -- from putting young men, teenagers in jails with adults. I went to Alabama undercover to gather information about segregated academies to deprive them of tax-exempt status, which they did not deserve.I went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, gathering information to make the case that every child in America, including children with disabilities, should have the right to a public school education.And as we heard this morning from a -- just a wonderful, distinguished older woman by the name of Mae Wiggins who came all the way down to tell her story. She was a nurse in New York City back in the 1970's, excited about being a young nurse, getting her career off to a start. And she was looking for a place to live, and she had a budget like everybody does. And she found what she thought would be the perfect place. It was within her budget. It was close to work.She went to apply for an apartment. It was a new building -- brand new building. It wasn't even totally finished yet. She went into the little office and asked for an application and they said, ""Oh, we don't have any apartments."" She said, ""But I saw the advertisement."" ""Well, we have no apartments left.""Well, she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her African- American friends who had gone to that apartment run by Donald Trump and his father, Fred, had been told there were no apartments.So she had the gumption to go and make a complaint, which led to the Justice Depart-ment suing them for discrimination. They settled the suit, but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating.So when you hear, as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks, that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination, take it seriously, my friends, because it truly is -- it truly is at stake in this election.And I was also very, very grateful. I had a role in helping to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady, and let me tell you, one of the great -- one of the great honors as I travel across the country is meeting young people who are the beneficiaries or meeting their families.I met a woman here in North Carolina who told her story and we actually recorded it because all of us were so moved by what she had to say when her baby was born. Her daughter, she was deaf. And the doctors all said she'll never -- she'll never communicate, so she cannot learn to speak, so you need to teach her sign language.And the mom did all this research and concluded that there were some treatments that might help her daughter, but she didn't have that kind of money. They didn't have that kind of insurance. And she was telling her doctor she didn't know what to do, and the doctor just serendipitously said, ""You know, there's this new program, it's called the Children's Health Insurance Program. It's for people who are not poor, but they don't make enough money to afford that kind of insurance, and they don't work for an employer who provides it. You should look into it."" And she did. And that began the process of her getting the treatment that her daughter needed.And when I met the mother, I also met the daughter, right here. I talked with her. She told me how proud she was because she had just graduated from college, George Washington University.So, yes, you know, I do sweat the details and I do have a lot of plans. Tim Kaine and I put a whole book out called ""Stronger Together"" telling you exactly what we're going to try to do if we're fortunate enough to be president and vice president because I actually think it's important for you to know what we're going to do together.And as your -- as a senator, I helped to rebuild New York City after 9/11 and provided health care to our brave first responders. As your secretary of state, I traveled to 112 countries, negotiated cease-fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and LGBT rights all around the world.And you know, everything I've done started by listening to people. Listening to hear your stories, what you're worried about, and then working to bring people together to find common ground, even with people who disagreed with me on lots of issues.You know, when I was first lady, I had a great commitment to kids in foster care and I wanted to improve our foster care and adoption laws, and I was looking for some Re-publican to work with me, and I found one because I did my research and found out that one of the most partisan Republicans, Congressman Tom DeLay from Texas, had a heart for children in foster care. He and his wife had fostered children, and I called him up.I said, ""Congressman, would you work with me to change the laws on foster care and adoption?"" There was a silence. He said, ""Well, what do you want me to do?"" I said, ""Well, come to the White House. Come to a meeting. We'll sit down and figure out what we can do."" And we did, and I meet those kids, and I meet those families, kids who were taken out of foster care and given the chance to have a loving permanent family for the first time.Now, I'm telling you this because I really believe that's the only way we're going to get things done. And if you elect me next Tuesday, that is the kind of president I will be.So, let me just mention a few of the ideas that we've been putting forward to help you and your families get ahead and stay ahead because I truly believe you need a candidate you can vote for, not just someone to vote against.But as you're making this choice, we need to be clear about what the choice is, because come January 20th, America will have a new president. It will either be me or my opponent.Now, I think it's fair to say, things are going to change. Change is part of life. That much is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to see? Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better America or are we going to fear each other and fear our future?I want you just to imagine, imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon who's elected on January 20th, because by imagining it, I want you to think about every issue you care about, everything that is dear to you, everything that you heard from Pharrell and from Bernie.It's hard for me to imagine that we would have a president who has demeaned women, mocked the disabled, insulted African-Americans and Latinos, pitted people against each other instead of bringing them together. That is, unfortunately though, what we have seen in this campaign, what we have seen, what's been said and how distressful it's been.I know there are a lot of people who are upset about what's going on in this campaign, aren't there? People come and talk to me. I've had people say that they can't sleep, that their stomachs are bothering them, they have headaches. And I think that's an im-portant signal because this is a big decision. And as Michelle Obama has said, the presidency doesn't change you -- who you are, it reveals who you are.And I think it's fair to say that my opponent has already revealed who he is. And he wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to the United States. Our country is founded on religious freedom. It is one of the most important building blocks of our democracy.He has said that he thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and des-pair. He has no idea -- no idea about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black-owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities.He seems not to recognize the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field.And we saw that again in the way he treated the Central Park Five. These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14, who were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York City back in 1990. Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence.And in addition, someone else confessed to the crime, so they were finally released from prison. But not only did Trump refuse to apologize for what he had said about them and even calling for their executions, he actually said, ""They should still be in prison."" Evidence didn't matter. The law didn't matter. To him, those kids would always be guilty.So think about it, if he wants to keep exonerated people in jail, how can we trust him to fight for the rule of justice and fairness and criminal justice reform in America?Do we want him appointing our judges?Audience: No!Clinton: Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?Audience: No!Clinton: Well, I've said many times, he has shown us who he is, now it is up to us to decide who we are. And right now, people across our country are coming together to do just that. They are rejecting the dark and divisive vision for one that is more hopeful and inclusive. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear each other down.And that's why I do believe we are stronger together, so let me paint you a different picture. Here's what we're going to do together. We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow-through because we refuse to accept as normal some of what we're seeing across America.What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not have happened and it should never be accepted. People painted the words ""Vote Trump"" on the side and then set it on fire. Who would do that? Who would do that to a place of worship where people seek solace? That can never be normal. It can never be acceptable.What happened in Flint, Michigan, as Bernie said, can never be normal, can never be acceptable.Little children drinking and bathing in poisoned water that will affect their health for years to come.And then we know, don't we? Too many young African-Americans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence.We know their names; Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner and Sandra Bland and Keith Scott and so many others. We have got to face this, and we're going to get to work to do just that. We are going to - we are going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and we're going to replace it with a cradle-to-college pipeline.And we're going to start with our youngest kids and their families to give them the support that they need. And we're going to take a hard look at what we need to do to make sure every child has the chance to attend good schools with good teachers, no matter what their ZIP code is.And we will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end. It is wrong, my friends, that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same offenses.When I -- when I launched this campaign back in April of 2015, the very first speech I gave was on the topic of criminal justice reform. I said then and I have repeated it throughout this campaign, we must end the era of mass incarceration.Too many families have been broken up, too many communities have been so badly affected. We have to reform these mandatory minimums and sentencing. We have to ban the box so people who have served their time can get a real chance at a good job and a fresh start.And we have to restore trust between police and communities. We are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law.This is important, of course, to families and communities, but it is important to all of us. This is about who we are as a country, about whether we really are a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all. Too often, despite the progress we've made, we fall short of that goal, and we have to be honest about it.I am determined to make this one of the most important projects of my presidency and I hope all of you will join me in doing that.And I have to say - I have to say that is only part of what must be done because the leading cause of death for young African-American men, more than the next nine causes.We have 33,000 people a year dying from guns. I just cannot tolerate this any longer. I have met the families of those who have lost loved ones, who have lost the first graders in Sandy Hook, the bible study churchgoers in Charleston, the club-goers in Orlando, the moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado, people going about their lives being cut down and cut senselessly short. We have to take steps to reduce gun violence, and I know we can do that because the vast majority of Americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well.And we've got to make investments in those communities that are struggling, especially communities of color.When I was in eastern North Carolina today and I was talking to people there who had been devastated by Hurricane Matthew, people who didn't have very much to start with, who lost everything, farmers with 100, 200 acres growing sweet potatoes, wiped out. We've got to help everybody get ahead.I believe that the economy must work for everyone, not just those at the top. And I think hardworking Americans deserve a raise and women deserve equal pay.So, how are we going to do this? Well, we're going to go where the money is. Just as Bernie said, we're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again.And I can't wait to work with Bernie to make public colleges and universities like N.C. State right here at Raleigh tuition-free.I know that this is another issue Pharrell feels passionately about as well. If you're struggling with student debt, we're going to cut that and help you pay it back and get out from under it.And in my plan is a $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities - schools like Shaw and Saint Augustine - because you know they produce some of the finest leaders in our country, and I want to make sure they keep doing that vital work.So we could go on all night. I mean, Bernie and I could really keep you here until breakfast because we get excited about what we can do. But of course, we can't do anything if you don't get out and vote and get everybody you know to vote.This is going to be one of the most consequential elections in our country's history, you know that, because we are at a crossroads. It's not just who my opponent is. Pharrell is right, we don't even have to mention his name very much. Right? It's not just about him, although there are some special features that certainly raise deep concerns. It's about who we are. It's about what we want, what we're going to do to make our mark on our country at this time in our history.I believe -- I believe America's best days are still ahead of us if we do what we're sup-posed to do.Every social movement, every economic advance has only come about because people were willing to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the face of adversity. It's not easy. It wasn't easy to get the vote for women. It wasn't easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the Civil Rights Act was enforced. It wasn't easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down.And right now, you know, because in this state a lot of effort was put into trying to suppress the vote, right?And some people got discouraged about that. I've met some people who say, well, you know, I don't even know what they want, what kind of identification. It gets a little discouraging. You cannot get discouraged. Do not grow weary while doing good, right?It is now our turn -- our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back because we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise.And in this election, President Obama's entire legacy is on the line, everything that he has worked so hard to do against implacable opposition. As the president said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent upon him being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he believes in.So I got to tell you, I've told the president I'm ready to take the baton, but he's going to have to bend over because he's a lot taller than I am.But I'm not just taking it, all of us are taking it. We are ready to grab that baton, to defend and build upon the progress of his presidency, and that is why everyone must vote. Early vote and vote on Tuesday if you can't get to early vote.And listen to this, more than two million right here in North Carolina have already voted.So make no mistake about it, you can make the difference, not only in who you elect, but in the agenda that those people will then get to work on. I want you to hold me accountable. I want you to be my partners, but I can't do any of this.You know, when I was with our wonderful first lady last week, she reminded —she reminded the big crowd we had in Winston-Salem that President Obama in 2008 won this state by about 14,000 votes. If you break that down, you know what the difference between winning and losing is? Roughly two votes per precinct. So don't let anybody tell you their vote doesn't matter. You've got to get everyone you know to come out and vote. You can vote early through this Saturday, November 5th. If you don't know where to vote, go to iwillvote.com to confirm your voting location because the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in American history.And then that will be the story of this election. Let's make that one for the history books. Please be part of what we're doing in these next days and let's make sure that we not only have a future we can believe in, but one we can help create together, and demonstrate, once and for all, that love trumps hate. Thank you all.","UCSB"
"78",2016-11-03,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Pitt Community College in Winterville, North Carolina","Thank you so much, wow, it is great to be here. And thank you. I am so honored to be introduced by Mae Wiggins and someone who made such a contribution throughout her life as a nurse to so many people and who, as you can tell, just feels still the pain of being rejected on the basis of her race.It took a lot of courage to come here, Mae. Thank you. Thank you for being with us.I also want to thank a long-time friend of mine, a great activist, extraordinary advocate in Congress, and that's U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. I want to thank Mayor Allen Thomas for welcoming me here. And either you're all related to him or you think he's doing a good job.Well, I told him I want to be a good partner with mayors like him. And work to help communities like Greenville that are growing and striving and attracting young people. He told me that the average age in the residents here in Greenville was 26 years old.I also want to acknowledge Josh Stein, candidate for North Carolina attorney general. Patsy Keever, chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party. And State Senator Don Davis.And I saved the best for last, someone who I've gotten to know over the years; someone who I really look forward to working with. First thing that Congressman Butterfield said to me is ""I have to talk to you about our farmers."" Very first thing he said. Proceeded to tell me that he was out on a 200-acre sweet potato farm earlier today. We talked about the damage that Hurricane Matthew has done; the lives lost; the homes lost; and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding. And my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected. We've got to be really focused on what we're going to do with this extreme weather. We're getting more of it in more places. And I'm going to make that a priority for my presidency to make sure communities are well prepared. They're resilient. But that we also work to try to limit the damage by taking on the challenge of climate change and changing weather patterns.And nobody knows more about weather than our farmers. And I am very committed to supporting farms of all sizes, but particularly small farms. You know, I think you said the farm you went to this morning, G.K., was 200 acres. You know, that's a lot of land, but that's not a gigantic multi-thousand-acre farm. And sometimes I think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big, giant farms, and not enough taking care of the smaller farms, the family-owned farms, farms that have been in people's families for generations.And I will do my very best working with G.K. and Eleanor and others in Congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it. And eastern North Carolina is a place that needs it. There are still too many people who feel like they have been left out and left behind. And so we've got to spend time thinking about how we bring everybody along.That is my goal as your president. I want to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people and places getting ahead. Now also, on a personal note, I was in Arizona last night and had a great rally there. I don't know -- 15,000, 16,000 people. It was just extraordinary. But I was a little anxious during my speech because the Cubs were playing in the World Series.And, you know, I've been a fan all my life; started watching baseball with my dad; went to Wrigley Field. And, you know, it's been a long time, 108 years, to win a championship and make history. And I only wish that my late father and the great Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub, could have seen it happen. So last night was very special on lots of fronts. And who knows? Maybe we'll see even more history made in a few days. You know, the last time the Cubs won, women couldn't vote. And I think women are making up for that in this election.So thank you. Thank you so much for being here. Are you ready to vote? How many -- how many folks have already voted? [applause]Well, that's really impressive. Are you ready to volunteer these last few days? Are you ready to elect Ray Cooper your governor? Have a governor who puts families first and your needs. I know he'll do a terrific job. Are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? She will be the independent voice that North Carolina families deserve. And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. And then, are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief?You know, did any of you -- any of you see those debates? Well, you know, I spent four-and-a-half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief.But, you know, he kept saying things like, ""Well, you know, what have you done for 30 years?"" Well, we know what he's done for 30 years, starting with discriminating against African Americans and denying them housing back in the 1970s.I chose a different path. I have spent my career fighting for kids and families. And I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady. That now provides healthcare to 8 million children a year. And I have to tell you, I know it doesn't make headlines. It's not going to, you know, get a big Twitter war going, but when I travel around and shake hands like I'll do after my remarks, and somebody says to me, ""The Children's Health Insurance Program saved my son's life."" I met a woman here in North Carolina whose daughter was born deaf. And the doctor said, ""You know, she's never, ever going to be able to talk; she's not ever going to be able to hear."" Her mother, who is determined, began doing investigations; she found out that there were some possible treatments. But they were expensive. She didn't know what she was going to do. And she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said ""I just heard about this new program, the children's health insurance program. Maybe you can qualify for that.""Because it's really for families that aren't poor, but don't have much money, and a lot of families isn't it. And families that don't have an employer that provides health insurance, self employed, independent contractors.So, the mom found out about this thing call the children's health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter. I met that young woman, and she said hello to me and she talked to me. She just graduated from college, right here in North Carolina. So don't let anybody tell you, it doesn't matter what you stand for, what you fight for, and who you are trying to help. When you make your decision about who to vote for in this election.As a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it. And many of them—Audience: [inaudible]Clinton: Where you there? God bless you. That's another thing, I meet people all over who were there, and who worked there and I meet people who got sick because they worked there. And as your Secretary of State, I traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's right and LGBT rights around the world.And everything I've done, it's because I've been listening to people and again I know that's not very exciting. I plead to that. You spend time listening not talking, you know, what are the poor journalists going to say, ""Uh, there Hillary Clinton was listening again,"" right?But I'll tell you it is what motivates me to hear people's stories, to hear the tribulations and triumphs. You get good ideas. Bring people together; find common ground, even with people we disagree with. I disagree with people on lots of issues, but I believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other, and try to find common that common ground. And that will enable us to get results for people. And if you elect me next Tuesday that is the kind of President I'll be.And from the first day of this campaign, I've been telling you what I want to do. Putting forth my ideas about what I think will help you. I truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for, not just someone to vote against. And so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear. The positives and the negatives, because one way or the other, come this January, America is going to have a new President. And it will be either me or Donald Trump.And you know what else? People say all the time, you know I want change, will come, that is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to have. Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America, or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices, our discrimination that stops us from coming together? So, here is what I want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe haven't yet voted, maybe haven't yet made up their mind. I want you to ask them, imagine it is January 20th, 2017 and it is Donald Trump standing in front of the capital taking the Oath of Office.Imagine what that will be like to have him in the Oval Office, making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures. Imagine having a president who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults African Americans and Latinos. Who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together. Someone who always puts himself first and doesn't care who gets hurt along the wayA president with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him. Who praises adversaries like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the Pope. The truth is we don't have to imagine what that would be like, because everything that Donald Trump has said and done, both in his career and in his campaign, is a preview of what could happen.You know as Michelle Obama says, the presidency doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are. And we have all see all we need of Donald Trump. If Donald Trump were to win this election, we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous. Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war. And yet this morning in Florida, Donald stood on a stage and said and I quote ""I am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had"". Now -- he knows we can see and hear him, right?This is someone who at another rally, yesterday, actually said out loud to himself, stay on point Donald, Stay on point. His campaign probably put that in the teleprompters, stay on point Donald, stay on point. You know, we have seen it over and over again. We know his true self. His instinct is to say whatever pops into his head, no matter how wrong he is. He can't help himself. So is this someone we want to put in charge of our military?Is this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated, his disrespect throughout this campaign. In a country that values, religious liberty and freedom. Someone who would ban every Muslim in the world from ever coming to our country. Someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea, none, about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities, the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field. Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins. And Mae wasn't alone. Whenever African Americans tried to rent an apartment, their application was marked with a ""C"" -- ""C"" for colored.In fact, Donald, his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s. They settled the case, but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color. Think about that. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the federal housing department. If he doesn't respect all Americans, how can we trust him to serve all Americans?And then another recent example is the way Donald Trump treated what are called the ""Central Park Five."" These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. Who, it turns out, were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York back in 1990.Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence. Also, someone else confessed to the crime. So they were finally released from prison and justice was done, but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison.To him, those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says. Do we want this man appointing judges? Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?Audience: No!Clinton: Well, people who are voting for him, that's what they would get. He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters. He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories. And you better believe he's being heard loudly and clearly.Just a few days ago, and I want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major -- to a nominee of a major party. Just a few days ago, Donald Trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan.They wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign, ""Make America Great Again."" They said it's about preserving white identity. And they placed their faith and hope in him. You've got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution, who believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trump's America?It's not just about communities of color. It's about young people. It's about any of us who don't ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated. That is not who America is and we're not going to let it ever go back to that.But it doesn't end there. You've also got to ask: Do women and girls have a place either? Imagine our daughters, or in my case now my granddaughter, growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks; gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent. Just imagine what that would mean to young women's confidence and self-worth. And how that will affect our young men and boys, who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well.So, this is a pretty clear choice, North Carolina. I've said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. Right?And across America, people are doing just that -- rejecting Trump's dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful, inclusive and unifying. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear people down.We are called -- we are called. In fact, we are commanded, those of us who are Christians, to love our neighbor as ourselves, aren't we? We are not asked, we are not requested, we are not urged -- we are commanded. And we know how hard that is. When I used to teach Sunday School, I often taught on that, not because it was well known, but because I think it's so hard and challenging.Love your neighbor as yourself? Well, first, you've got to love yourself. You've got to respect yourself. And then you have to love your neighbor as yourself. I believe with all my heart that we are better than this. And that's why I want to paint a different picture. Because here's what we're going to do if we win this election. We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through.We are not going to accept the status quo. What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal. People painted ""vote Trump"" on the side. And then they set it on fire. Who would do that to a house of worship? In America, that can never be acceptable. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies, toddlers, children drinking water that was poisoning them. And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence. You know their names: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sander Bland, Key Scott. So many. We can't accept that as normal either.So we are going to get to work. I'm just telling you. If I'm fortunate enough to be your president, we're going to roll up our sleeves and get to work, because that's when we're at our best, solving our problems.We're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-career pipeline for every child in this country. I want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP code they live in.We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end. It is wrong. And I don't care whether you are black or white. It is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes. It's wrong, and we're going to do something about that. And Donald Trump, whenever he's face with these issues says ""well the answer to our problems is more law and order."" He doesn't tell you what he means by that, but it's kind of code for fear and division. What I think we need to do, is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities.I think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law, and everyone is respected by the law. And it's not all, we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives, because right now, we've got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill, felons, domestic abusers, terrorists. You know, we can't just bow down and say theres nothing we can do, commensurate with the second amendment. Donald's always trying to say ""oh, you know, she's going to repeal the second amendment."" What nonsense. Absolute nonsense. But I believe we can respect and honor the second amendment, and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands.And we're going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind. Congressman Butterfield and I were talking about this. There's some good ideas in the Congress to focus on communities, white, black, Latino, Native American, wherever they might be that have been left out. We need to get the engine of economic growth going, because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage, because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind. And I think not only do Americans deserve a raise, which Donald doesn't agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage, I think it's finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do.I don't know about you, but this is not just a women's issue. I'm always accused by Donald and his supporters, that whenever I talk like that, I'm playing the woman's card. Well, I've always said, if that's playing the woman's card, deal me in, you got that right.But I actually think I'm playing the family economics card, because if you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter, she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force.And we're going to have a big investments in new jobs, infrastructure jobs, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. And we're going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities. Put people to work, doing work that has a really productive purpose. We're going to invest in more clean, renewable energy jobs, these are jobs that cannot be exported, they have to be done right here in eastern North Carolina.Now it's fair to say ""Ok, that sounds good, how are you going to do all that?"" Ok, I'll tell you two things. First, I have said, and you can hold me to it, I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,00 a year. You see, I come from the middle class. My dad never made anything near that, even in those dollars back in those days. But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. Not the top down, that does not work for most Americans. And so, secondly, I'm going where the money is. The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years. And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy? It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself, to his family, to the wealthy, to corporations. I just think that's a bad, bad idea.We're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and we're going to make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again. And we're going to make public colleges like East Carolina University tuition-free. Tuition-free for working and middle class families, and debt free for everybody else. And if you're struggling with student debt, we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills, and get you out from under debt. And we're going to create $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities.But I don't think that every young person needs to go college. If you want to, I'm going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let's bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships. There is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent, and I'm asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are, and what kind of future we want. I just don't believe we're at our best when we stoke fear about each other. Now, that does not mean we have to agree about everything, of course not. But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society.I don't think I have all the answers, I don't think anybody does. When Donald Trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in America, I thought about our founders meeting in Philadelphia. It wasn't one person creating our country, it was many people working together. Think about every social movement, every economic advance, every university like this one, every achievement that you've made in your own life, somebody helped you. You worked with somebody. Look at this community. Everybody working together, making Greenville really grow and thrive, making this university better and better every single year. That is my experience of America, so here's what I hope you will do. I hope you will get everybody you know, and yourselves , if you haven't voted yet, to vote early. Because the other's strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls. Now, Donald Trump's campaign knows that if women turn out, if people of color turn out, if young people turn out, if people who share our vision of a positive unified country, turnout, there's no way he can win, because that is more than half the people in America.You may have noticed that President Obama was in Chapel Hill yesterday. He's coming back to North Carolina tomorrow, because he know how hard it is to get anything done in Washington. As he said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent on him being to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he does. Well I'll tell you what, I'm ready to grab that baton. He's going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it, because you know he's a tall man. But I've been practicing. I spent four years working with him. I call him my partner and my friend, and I am ready to defend and build on his progress, coming out of his eight years of the presidency.So let's get out and vote, and let's vote for the kind of future that we want, the kind of country that we want. Find your early voting location for the next three days, please, go take people there. We will show once and for all, love trumps hate, thank you all.","UCSB"
"79",2016-11-04,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Eastern Market in Detroit, Michigan","Hello Detroit! Thank you! I'll tell you, I am so glad to be back in Michigan. And that introduction, I'm just still vibrating from it. I thank my longtime friend, Reverend Wendell Anthony, for giving us some of the best lines that we've had in the whole campaign. Thank you Wendell.You know, there's something special about this place. And some of you may have recognized the song that was playing when I came in, an amazing anthem sung by the talented Andra Day called 'Rise Up.' And that is what Detroit is doing – you are rising up! And that is exactly what we're going to do in America. We are going to rise up and make sure the American dream is big enough for everyone.I'm looking forward to working with the great team you have here in Detroit and in Michigan. I want to thank your senators, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters. I want to thank your members of Congress, Congressman John Conyers, Sandy Levin, Congresswomen Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell. I want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Mike Duggan, and thank you. Wayne County Executive Warren Evans. Sheriff Benny Napoleon. The president of the UAW, Dennis Williams. Longtime friends and former colleagues of mine, former Senator Carl Levin and his wife Barbara are here. And to all who are present today. And I was delighted that my friend and my supporter, Mark Cuban, could be here because – he's not only a real billionaire – he's actually shared his profits with his employees.Now, are you ready to vote on Tuesday? Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote? Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief? Did any of you see the three debates that we had? Well, I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president.Now, he kept saying a lot of unusual things, didn't he? And, you know, there's a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates, and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States. And I did practice my composure. People said to me, well, how did you do that? The things he was saying. And then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you. I said, well, I did practice. And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me. So I was ready. But he would say, like, 'Well, what have you done for 30 years?' And you know, I don't want to brag. But I do think it matters what you've done, and especially what you've done that maybe improves somebody else's life, right?And one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what we've been doing. For example, as First Lady, I helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids. And these are families that they're not poor families, they're working people, but they don't make enough money and they don't work for somebody who provides insurance, and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had. I met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf, and the doctor said, 'We're sorry, there's really nothing we can do for her.' But this mother, like many mothers I know, did not take that for an answer, right? She got on the internet. She began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter, but they were expensive and she and her husband didn't have that kind of money and they didn't have insurance. She was at her doctor's office and just so distraught, and the doctor said, 'Well, there's this new thing called the Children's Health Insurance Program. Maybe you should look into it.' Turned out she was eligible. She signed up. She started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have, by the way. And when I was in North Carolina, I heard about her and I got to meet her, but more than that, I met her daughter, who talked to me and who just graduated from college – because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have.I'll tell you what, that is how I judge my last 30 years. Have I done something to help somebody else? I am well aware of the blessings that I have had, and I want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward, make it possible for more families, more kids to have the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.And I was a Senator in New York on 9/11, so I know what can happen – the evil and the hatred of terrorism. I saw it. And I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger, not away from it – our police, our firefighters, our EMTs. And I'll tell you who else we got covered. We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools, and I see one right out there who knows exactly what I'm talking about. All across the city, people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger. That was America at its best. And don't ever forget what we are capable of being, who we are. We are not afraid. We are brave, courageous people who will do our best if given the chance.As your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, negotiated ceasefires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and worker rights and LGBT rights. I'm telling you this because I want you to know that I will do everything I can. If I am honored to be your president, I will get up every day in that White House, and I will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to get the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have.I want you to have a candidate you can vote for and not just someone to vote against. That's why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues, not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election, it is a choice between two very different visions for America. I've got to say when I hear my opponent talk about America, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. It is so dark, so divisive, so hateful. That is not the America that I believe in. I believe that we should have a confident, optimistic, inclusive vision of where we're going and how we're going to get there. I love our country, and I believe in the American people. And I think there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them. You see, we believe in an America that is bighearted, not small-minded. We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part. And we believe America is great because America is good. Never forget that. If we lift each other up and not tear each other down, we can go even further. And I believe with all my heart. That's why the slogan of my campaign sums it up, that we are stronger together.And so come next January 20th, America is going to have a new president. I know – I know that – I know that a lot of people say that they want change. Well, let me tell you this. Change is inevitable. There will be change. The question is, what kind of change are we going to have? Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better country or are we going to fear the future and each other? I sure hope not. That is not the America that I believe we are.And so here is what I want to ask you to do. I want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors. Michigan is one of these states that doesn't have early voting. I've been all over the country going to states that are already voting. In fact, I don't know. About 31 to 32-3 million people have already voted in those states. But Michigan votes on Tuesday.And I imagine – I imagine there are – some of you know people who say they're going to vote for Donald Trump. Right? I know. I know. I understand that. I mean, I would hope you would try to stage an intervention before it's too late. But maybe you could ask them with you to imagine, imagine January 20th, 2017. And imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol. Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled, who insults African Americans and Latinos and Muslims, who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively. Now, the truth is we really don't have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done, both in his career and in this campaign, tells you what could happen.Now, Michelle Obama, who says so many wise and wonderful things, she said the presidency doesn't change who you are; it reveals who you are. And I think we've seen who Donald Trump is.Maya Angelou, another great American, Maya Angelou said, when someone shows you who he is, believe him the first time. And if my opponent were to win, we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself.Just last year, he said again it wouldn't have mattered if we had rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt. What is he talking about? I'm proud that President Obama saved the auto industry. And I'm even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry just had its best year ever.If Donald wins the election, we'd have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States. We are a country founded on religious freedom. That runs contrary to our Constitution. We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of black-owned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities. He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field. I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony, don't you?Yesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named Mae Brown Wiggins. Decades ago, she was a hard-working nurse in New York City. She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent. But Donald Trump and his father, Fred, turned her away. You see, whenever African Americans tried to rent Trump apartments, their application was marked with a 'C,' C for colored. And that didn't sit very well with Mae, so she went to the authorities, and eventually the Department of Justice sued the to us for housing discrimination. And although they settled, they wouldn't change. So the government had to take them back to court. That's a pattern. This is what happens time and time again with my opponent. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the Federal Housing Department. If he doesn't respect all Americans now, how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?He has such a casual disregard of our Constitution. He doesn't seem to understand the rule of law, that we really are a nation of laws, not men. Here's the latest example. There was a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City. It was called the Central Park Five. Maybe some of you have heard of it. There were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. They were wrongfully convinced, and they were in prison where they spent years. Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids. And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime, Trump actually said they should still be in prison. It doesn't matter if you're innocent. If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up. No wonder he admired Vladimir Putin, because that's exactly what Putin does to his people.So we can't trust him with our Constitution. We can't trust him to obey the rule of law. He has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. So let me paint you a different picture. Here is what we're going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night.We have three big challenges. Number one, we got to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. Number two, we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence toward peace and prosperity. Number three, we've got to bring our country together. We have got to overcome these divides. We have to heal our nation. And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges.I have said repeatedly that we're going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back, it can lead to holding other people back. We can't accept as normal what we're seeing across our country because of his campaign. A church in Mississippi was burned this week. Someone painted 'Vote Trump' on the side and then set it on fire. We can't let – we can't let that happen. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable. Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water. Those are basics. We've got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children.And it's important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody, that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II – infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean, renewable energy technology. Some people say we can't do that. Well, I'm telling you, they're wrong. They're wrong. We have the best workers, the most productive workers. We're going to give them more to work on, more products to produce. And we're going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities. And I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America. That means we're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with the cradle-to-college pipeline.And we're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers, no matter what zip code that child lives in. And I want to start with our youngest kids, with pre-kindergarten programs. And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers. We've got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children. And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.It'll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other. I believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law. And that's what we're going to work for.We're also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives. This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent. Have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now? Really. We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place.And while we create more safe communities, we want to invest in those communities. I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic Presidents have done, one named Clinton, one named Obama. And I want to be a really strong partner. I'll compete a little with them. I want to be a really strong partner with Detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support, the housing, and the jobs that you need.But we also have to make sure our economy is fairer. That's why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage, because people who work full time should not be left in poverty. And isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women? This is not a women's issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a daughter, or a sister who works, it's your issue. It's a family issue. And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare, paid family leave, equal pay for women, the other side accuses me of playing the women's card. I'll tell you what, if standing up for equal pay is playing the women's card, then deal me in.And one of the other big challenges we're going to take on – I am so excited about this. I am really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues. And what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate. So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university, you will go tuition-free if your family makes less than $125,000 a year. And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you don't go into debt. And for people who already have student debt, we're going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it. And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country.Now, this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign, because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election. I had a friend say to me the other day, 'People are just frustrated and angry.' I get that. I understand that. We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in '08 and '09. Millions of people lost their jobs, millions lost their homes, family wealth was wiped out. That is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that. I get it. But I learned a long time ago from my late mother, anger is not a plan. Right? Be angry, vent about it, and then roll up your sleeves and get to work. That's what I will do. That's why we've put this all down. It's on our website, hillaryclinton.com. It's in a book that Tim Kaine and I put out called 'Stronger Together.' Because not only do I want you to know what I will try to do as your president; I want you to hold me accountable. I want you, when I come back to Detroit, which I will do when I travel around Michigan, which I will do, I want you to say, 'Well, how's it going getting those new jobs started? How much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable?' I believe in making lists. Maybe it's a women's thing. My husband said – once said to me one time, 'You have lists of your lists.' Well, I do because I want to know what we're going to get done and how we can make progress together.And ultimately, this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids, and in my case now, my grandkids. Are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all?""Audience: ""Yes.""Clinton: ""Are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal? I believe we can do this together. My opponent at his convention said, 'I alone can fix it.' Well, no, nobody alone does anything. When our founders met in Philadelphia, it wasn't one person creating our country. It was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers' rights and women's rights and LGBT rights. None of them – none of them were won by one person alone. The American labor movement didn't happen because somebody one day said, 'I alone can make it happen.' It took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in. Barack Obama wasn't put into the White House by one person alone. It took everybody working and organizing, and yes, voting. That is how progress happens in America.So really, it all comes down to you, my friends. You have to vote. Our progress is on the line. Everything that has happened up until this point is on the line. I'm ready to defend and build on the progress that we've made. I'm proud I was a member of President Obama's cabinet. I'm proud that – he and I are friends. But he knows and I know that American leadership, American presidents, it's like running a relay. You do your very best, and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you pass it off to doesn't drop to the ground or doesn't turn around and run back the way we came from, which is what my opponent is promising to do.Now, I've told the President that when he hands off the baton that he's going to have to bend over. He's a lot taller than I am. But I'm excited about what we can do. I know this has been a tough campaign. I've got people coming up to me saying they've got migraines they never had before. They have stomachaches that they don't know what they're going to do with. I get it. It has been in many ways a really tough campaign, but I'll tell you what. Michigan, you can make the difference.All I'm asking you is talk to your friends, talk to your family, talk to your coworkers, talk to everybody. If you have time to volunteer, go to hillaryclinton.com to volunteer or text 'join,' J?o-i-n, to 47246. Because when your children – and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today. When your children or grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.' An America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate. Let's get to work. Thank you. Thank you, Detroit. Thank you, Michigan. God bless you.","UCSB"
"80",2016-11-07,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan","Hello Grand Valley! Thank you! Thank you.It is great to be back in western Michigan. Thank you. Are there any Lakers here?Oh, my gosh. I am so thrilled to be here. I want to thank the president of this great university, Tom Haas, the faculty, the staff, the students. I want to thank Brandon Dillon, the Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. And I especially really want to thank you for sending Debbie Stabenow to the United States Senate.I have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with Debbie, gotten to know her, become a friend of hers, and I am so excited at the possibility that I'll be able to work with her again. But I want you to know this - and I really, really hope you'll tell folks, because there is no more dedicated, effective member of the United States Senate than Debbie Stabenow.She fights for all of you every day, but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face. And she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking. And don't we need more of that in Washington where people actually talk and listen to each other. So it's wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by Debbie.Are you ready to vote tomorrow, Michigan? Are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow? That is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow.The choice in this election could not be clearer. And I know that for many people, you've gone back and forth, you've thought about what to do, and I really respect that. But let me say this. Let me say this. This election is basically between division and unity in our country.It's between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk. It is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top. And I want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about. Because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot, those issues, and those values, are on the ballot as well.And as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election. I have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades, and people who ran for president. I was privileged to know as a college student, Gerald Ford.In fact, I had an internship with the House Republican Conference Committee, which he headed, after my junior year in college. So when I say I've gotten to know a lot of our presidents, and people who've run for president, it goes back a ways. And here's what I want you to understand. I didn't agree with everything they did or said. Even the Democrats. We had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle, but I never doubted, I never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commander-in-chief.That's why this election is so different. And it's why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me, and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party. Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election.I was at Kent State, in Ohio, last week and I was introduced by a gentleman by the name of Bruce Blair. And Mr. Blair had served in the Air Force, he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer. That meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed. And his job - imagine the responsibility. A young Air Force officer in his twenties, waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons.And Bruce Blair explained that there is no appeal from a president's order to do that. The joint chiefs of our military forces can't say, ""No, don't do it."" There's no veto from Congress or anyone else. And the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes.So after watching this election Mr. Blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing. And several dozen of them - I'd never met them before - several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief.The awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something I want you to think about between now and the time you vote. Because I will pledge to you that I will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency.I also want to pose to you a contrast in visions. Did any of you see the debates? First of all, I did stand for four and a half hours with Donald Trump on the stage, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president.But I have to say, in addition to that, there were so many things that he said that of course I sometimes was surprised by. But the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for America. Now I have to tell you, I know we've got problems. I've spent 18 months traveling around our country talking to - by now - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people, hearing what's on people's minds. We've got challenges but America's always had challenges. And since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together?I often didn't recognize the country that Donald Trump was describing. Because from my perspective, looking back at our history, we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. And you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America that will set the stage for an even better future.And I want to say especially to the students who are here - I really believe that America's best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together.Make no mistake. Our core values are being tested in this election. But my faith in our future has never been stronger. Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was introduced by Mr. Khizr Khan.Some of you know or remember that his son, Captain Khan, serving in the United States Army, was killed serving in Iraq. And like at the Democratic Convention this summer, he spoke powerfully about what America means to him. And how we have to defend our values and our Constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world. People look at us with yearning. They see that we are a beacon of freedom, hope and opportunity for people, right here, at home.When I heard Mr. Khan speak at the convention, and I heard him again last night, I was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country. He said that when he started hearing Donald Trump speak, and all of the things he said about so many people, not only Muslims but African-Americans and Latinos and POWs and women and so many people - when he heard it he couldn't help but think as he walked around his house - he has a room where his son's medals - he got the Bronze Star, he got the Purple Heart - the flag that was draped on his coffin - is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in. And he thought to himself, ""Would there be any room for my son in Donald Trump's America?""Think about that for a minute. Because every single one of us has something to contribute. To this great country. We are already great but we can be greater. And we will be greater.I love our country and I believe in the American people, and I know there is nothing we can't do when we make up our minds. Throughout our history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy. They built the greatest middle class the world has ever known. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights and union rights, for LGBT rights, rights for people with disabilities.And now, now we've got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the chal-lenges of our time. We've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.If you believe, as I do, that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow. We are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.These are jobs we need doing in American and these are jobs that cannot be exported. They've got to be done right here in Michigan and across our country.And we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing. I am not one of these folks who think, ""We just can't make it in America anymore."" And I'll tell you why. Because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan, we can lead the world in precision machining, in 3-D printing. We're not competing for low-wage jobs, we're competing with Germany for high manufacturing, high- skilled jobs.And we are going to have clean, renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change. As you heard, my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas. And as I pointed out in the last debate, he buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of good American steel, made by American steel workers.He's gone all over this country, and he's gone all over Michigan, talking about how he's gonna really get more jobs and he's going to bring back what used to be there. Well I'll tell you what. Look at his record, don't just listen to his rhetoric.Because I have a different idea. We're going to invest in America again. And for every-body who is frustrated, and anxious, and maybe even angry because they feel left out, left behind, that America's not working the way it should - I understand that. I under-stand that. I represented upstate New York for eight years, and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories, picking up and moving out.But I also realized that anger is not a plan. You've got to come together and figure out what is it we're gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people.And I'll just tell you that I believe that we've got to defend the American worker's right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits.We're gonna get incomes rising here in western Michigan and across this state. And we're also gonna do more to help small business. My dad was a small businessman. He worked really hard. He ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies, and I would from time to time help him out. You take a silkscreen, you put it down on the long table, you pour the paint in, you do the squeegee, you pick it up - it wasn't automated, we were the automaters - and you'd go all the way down to one table, you'd go to the other table. So I know how hard people in small business work.And I also know something else. Donald Trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills. And I have said, ""I am sure glad my dad never got a contract from Donald Trump, because we could not have afforded that.""But it's not just enough to grow the economy. We have to make it fairer. And if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote. I think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job. I believe in hard work. That's how I was raised. But I also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldn't still be in poverty at the end of the year. And I'm gonna raise the national minimum wage.And one of the things I've heard all over America, especially from young families, really from all families but particularly young families, is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected - like where do you find affordable quality childcare? In lots of states, it's more expensive than college tuition. We're gonna get the cost of childcare down. We're going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or you're sick you won't lose your job.I saw the folks over there holding up the Tim Kaine sign and I really appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. I got to tell you - Tim and I were in Pittsburgh last month, with a big crowd, and we couldn't get everybody in, like today, so Tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby, probably about three years old. And he stopped to talk to her and she said, ""I came here because I wanted to tell you, and to tell Hillary Clinton, what happened to me."" She said that, ""I had my baby, it was a hard labor and delivery and I needed some time off. And I called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so I won't be in for - I think she said two weeks - and they said, ""OK. You're fired.""That is legal in America, still. And what that does is to say that - wait a minute, do we really value children? Do we really value families? And we've got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today's America.And then finally, I think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work.And you know I gotta say - this always gets a huge round of applause, as you can tell - but this is not just a woman's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter, who's in the work force, you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family.Just about everything I've said so far my opponent disagrees with. And whenever I talk about affordable childcare, and paid family leave, and equal pay - he says I'm playing the woman's card and you know what I say, if that's the case? Then deal me in.And here's what else I want you to know. It's fair to ask, ""How are you going to pay for that?"" That's not only fair, that's necessary to ask. Because I want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as I expect you're a good steward of your family budget. I have proposed a very simple formula. I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.And for small businesses, we're gonna cut your taxes because I know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief. So instead, we're going where the money is, to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations.And that is in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has proposed. His whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations. That is trickle-down economics on steroids. I profoundly disagree. I think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.When you think about it, Donald hasn't paid anything for 20 years. He's paid zero to support our military, our vets, Pell grants for students here at Grand Valley, our high-ways - and I am still pondering, I am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year.Especially when you're running casinos. I do not understand that. But that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he's not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting. And that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them.So, we'll still wonder. But what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs, not create jobs. And we can't afford that. We need to keep building. We have recovered from the worst financial crash since the Great Depression but we're not where we need to be yet. The last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down. And depriving people of the jobs that we want to create.And if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote.And if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote. I've got to say I am proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign about ideas and issues, not insults. And when it was over, we actually got together. What a novel idea. We wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared. So Bernie and I worked on this plan together.Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than a $125,000 a year. And they should be debt-free for everyone else because nobody should go into debt. And if you have gone into debt, if you're among the millions of Americans who are struggling - as I see some hands pointing in the air - paying back your student debt, we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off.It makes no sense at all. We have interest rates that are really low right now. Buy a car for what, 1 or 2 percent. You can buy a house for 3,4 percent. There are so many people who are paying 8, 10, 12, higher - 8, 10, 12 percent interest - how much? Twelve point seven. Fourteen point one. I got to tell you friends. That is outrageous. The federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college.I can't wait to roll up my sleeves with Debbie and Bernie and we're gonna get to work right after this election if I am fortunate enough to win.Look. Working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now. And that has to be our mission together. Doing all we can to help every American, and especially every young American and every child in America to have the chance to live up to their God-given potential. I will wake up every single day in the White House trying to figure out what I can do to make that a reality for you.So after tomorrow the work will begin, and one of the highest priorities that I feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together. A lot of people say we've got to heal our country, or as the Bible says repair the breach. Because we have so much divisiveness right now. We've got to start listening to each other. Respecting each other. I know it is unusual, I admit, for somebody running for president, especially the day before an election, but I've been saying this for months. To say that we need more of two things right now.We need more love and kindness in America.I don't know about you, I don't know about you but I bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe, I hope, we've all extended one. I am standing here today because my mother, who was abandoned by her parents, rejected by her grandparents, went to work at the age of 14 as a maid, and a babysitter, was extended kindness. Not by those who should have loved her, but by others. The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, who began bringing extra food. The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school. She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents' home and she got this job. And that woman said, ""I know you want to go to high school. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school, but you'll have to come back because we'll need you in the late afternoon.""Now that may sound harsh to say to a 14-year old but to my mother it was a gift. I tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others. And …There's a version of the golden rule in every major religion. And it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down. The question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up? And for people in our country who feel like they've been knocked down and nobody cares, nobody's paying attention, here's what I want you to know. If you give me the honor of being your president I'm gonna do everything I can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together.Because I want to be a president for all Americans.Democrats, Republicans, Independents. Not just the people who support me, everybody in this country. Because I believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future. So let's take that first step tomorrow. If you don't know where you're supposed to vote go to iwillvote.com - you can get all the information you need. If you want to help us bringing out the vote here in western Michigan in the last 24, 36 hours, you can still sign up to volunteer. Go to hillaryclinton.com. Or you can text join247246 or stop by one of our offices. We would be really excited to see you, because when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you'll be able to say that you voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.An America where we build bridges, not walls.And an America where we prove that yes, love trumps hate. Thank you all so much.","UCSB"
"81",2016-11-07,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at North Carolina State University in Raleigh","Thank you all! Whoa! Thank you! Thank you. Well, I got to tell you, this is sure worth staying up for. It is so great to be here in Raleigh, here at North Carolina State University. And I cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to Lady Gaga. One of the most inventive, creative and passionate performers, whose range goes from A to Z and beyond. And I was watching on the screen not only her perform, but all of you jumping and singing and waving. It was great! Because, you know what? That's what I want for America and the young people of America: the joy, the passion, the intensity! And our longtime friend, Jon Bon Jovi, was with us. He was with us up in Philadelphia, where he and Bruce Springsteen sang. And Jon said, 'Well, hey, I want to go down to Raleigh,' and so here he is! And between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow, we are going to be living on a prayer.I was really impressed when everybody's hand went up saying you'd already voted. Well, go find somebody else who hasn't voted, okay? Bring out your friends, your roommates, strangers on the street. Just stop and talk to them about what's at stake in this election. Because North Carolina is key, and it's not only important for our election. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper as your next governor? Well, I sure hope so. I sure hope so, and I hope you're ready to elect Linda Coleman your lieutenant governor. And how about Dan Blue, III, for state treasurer? And I really, really hope you will send Deborah Ross to Washington!Now, we are all fired up. When we were with the President and Michelle in Philadelphia. You know, the President was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is, and of course it is. I really believe it's the most important election of our lifetimes because we've never had a clearer choice. Never. It is a choice between division or unity; between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything. It's a choice between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as Americans.What I saw before I came in and what I see now is a sense of potential, of joy. There is no reason, my friends, why America's best days are not ahead of us if we reach for them together. We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America.Our core values – our core values are being tested in this election, but my faith in our future has never been stronger. I love our country and I believe in the American people. And I know if we bring everyone together, we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves.You know, one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country, as I have in this campaign, is meeting remarkable people – people who stand up against the odds; people who, like my late mother, people who understand that everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up, whether you believe you can keep going.Last night, in Manchester, New Hampshire, I had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man, Khizr Khan, whose son, Captain Khan, was killed serving our country in Iraq. You may remember Mr. Khan's speech at the Democratic Convention. And again last night, he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our Constitution. The story of Captain Khan is one of courage in the face of danger. He was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle. He told his men to stay back. He moved toward the vehicle to check it out. And the bomb went off. He lost his life, but everyone else in his unit survived. He was awarded the Bronze Star. And this intensely personal tragedy that the Khan family experienced, becoming a Gold Star family, was one that they thought about, grieved over in the privacy of their home, until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in America and who wasn't. The categories of people, starting with immigrants, including African Americans and Latinos and POWs and Muslims. The list went on and on. And it created in Mr. Khan a sense of despair because he asked himself, would his son have a place in Donald Trump's America? Someone who paid the ultimate price in serving our country.Well, we can answer that question tomorrow resoundingly: Yes. Absolutely.Think about – think about how generations of Americans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their time. Our parents, our grandparents, our great-grandparents defended democracy. They built the great American middle class. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights, and women's rights, for LGBT rights, and the rights of people with disabilities. And tomorrow we face the test of our time.So, remember, it's not just my name or Donald Trump's name on the ballot. It's the kind of country we want. It's every issue anyone cares about. So if you believe America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow. If you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean energy, small business, then you have to vote. If you believe we need more fairness in our economy to raise the minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty, then you have to vote. If you believe we need to do more to support working families with affordable childcare, paid leave, and equal pay for women, then you have to vote. And, remember, when my opponent says every time I talk about these issues that I'm playing the woman's card, well, you know what I say. Deal me in. And if you believe, if you believe, all kids deserve good schools with good teachers, no matter what house they live in, you have to vote. And if you believe college should be more affordable, you have to vote. Bernie Sanders and I worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free if you earn less than $125,000 and debt-free for everybody else. And for the millions of Americans struggling with student debt, we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off. If you believe in science and that we've got to address climate change, you have to vote. If you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so everyone is treated fairly, then you have to vote. And if you believe – if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws, well, then you know, you know, North Carolina. You've got to vote to get rid of HB2!Now, this is so energizing, we could keep going with a long list. But here's what – here's what else I want you to know. A good thing this election didn't land during exams, that's all I can say. Look. Tomorrow – tomorrow night, this election will end. But I want you to understand, our work together will be just beginning. We have to bridge the divides in this country. As the Bible says, we have to repair the breaches. We've got to be willing to start listening to each other again, respecting each other again. And I want to thank Gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting everybody.So I want you to know and I want you to spread the word. I do want to be President for all Americans, not just some, not just the people who support me and vote for me. I want to be President for everyone because we all have a role to play in building that better future for our country and for each of you.So if you haven't voted yesterday, go to iwillvote.com. You can get all the info you need. And you can still sign up to volunteer. Right? Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or stop by one of our offices. We would welcome you to help make sure everybody gets out to vote tomorrow because none of us want to wake up Wednesday morning and wish we had done more. Right?And years from today, when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America, an America where we build bridges, not walls, and where we prove conclusively that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you! Let's go vote, North Carolina! God bless you! Thank you all very much!","UCSB"
"82",2016-11-07,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks at the University of Pittsburgh","Hello, Pittsburgh! Woah! Hello back there! Thank you, thank you. Wow! It's great to be here at this extraordinary time in our country's history at this great university to have a chance on a beautiful day to lift our sights, to think about what we are capable of doing together. The kind of future that we can create if we search for and find common ground. And it is thrilling to have traveled across our country to see the hopefulness, to talk about the positive changes that are occurring. To really see America at its best, and tomorrow, each and every one of you gets to make a decision as to whether or not, first, you will vote. Because in Pennsylvania, it's all about Election Day. Other places around the country have been voting for weeks. And what you will vote for. I'm here to ask you to vote for yourselves, vote for your families, vote for your futures, vote on the issues that matter to you because they are on the ballot, not just my name and my opponent's name. I want to thank Tom Colicchio for coming out here. He's in the middle of opening another one of his great restaurants, but he said he's got these two small kids and he just had to come and be part of lifting up this election and creating the kind of commitment that will bring a record breaking number of Americans to vote. We are on the path to seeing more Americans coming out to vote than we have ever seen in our history. And I am hoping that you won't just come out to vote, obviously, I hope you vote for me, but I also hope you will send Katie McGinty to the United States Senate. We've got some great elected officials here, and I want to recognize Congressman Mike Doyle, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, from Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto, from Braddock, PA, Mayor John Fetterman. But mostly, I'm here to say thanks. Thanks for taking time out to think about what's -- what the stakes are. I love you all, too. Absolutely! So for those who are still making up your minds or thinking, 'Maybe, maybe it's not worth voting at all,' let me just say: the choice in this election could not be clearer. It really is between division or unity. Between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon. Between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and an economy that is set up and run for those at the top. Now, I have spent my public career fighting for kids and families, and standing up for our country, and if you give me the privilege of your vote tomorrow, that is what I will do every single day of my presidency. I will get up in the White House, and I will think about what I can do that day to knock down barriers, to create opportunities, so that you have the chance to fulfill your own dreams. You see, I believe America's best days are still ahead of us. Now, that doesn't mean we don't have to work for it because we do. That doesn't mean that we can just expect it to happens as kind of a birthright, but I really believe that. I would not have worked for 18 months, travelled across our country, thought as hard as I have about what we need to do and how to do it together, proudly stand up and defend the legacy of President Obama, which has given our country progress in the right direction if I did not believe with all my heart that we could do this. Right? We can do this! We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. And our core values are being tested in this election. And I know that people are frustrated, a lot of people feel left out and left behind. There's fear, even anger, in our country. But I've got to say: anger is not a plan, my friends. If we're going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems, then we've got to start talking to each other again, and we have to get good ideas wherever they come from. Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was with Khizr Khan, whose son was killed while serving in Iraq. You might remember him from the Democratic Convention. He was not a man to be on the stage of a political convention, but when he heard my opponent say what he said about Muslims and he looked at the flag that had been draped on his son's coffin, he felt compelled to speak out. He spoke powerfully about what America means to him and how we have to defend our values and our Constitution. As he said last night, his son serving in the United States Army with his unit saw something suspicious, moved toward it to check it out telling his men to stay behind, and when the car exploded, he lost his life. He was awarded Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, but as Mr. Khan said, ""When you listen to all the people that my opponent has insulted and denigrated, would there be a place in Donald Trump's America for Captain Khan?"" The Khan family gives me hope because they truly believe in the values of this great country of ours, and they have stood up holding the Constitution as he did at the convention to say, ""People around the world cherish this Constitution, believe in our values. It's a source of hope for billions of people. We will never, ever let that go, and we never let someone rip it away in the kind of negative, divisive, hateful campaign that we have seen from the other side in this election."" Sometimes when I hear my opponent speak, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. That doesn't mean we don't have problems and challenges, it doesn't mean that we don't have to do more to help people across our country get better economic opportunities. Of course, we do. But boy, I believe we can do it. I love our country. I believe in the American people. I know what we are capable of. Throughout of history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy, built the greatest middle class that the world has ever seen, marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, and rights for people with disabilities. Tomorrow, we face the test of our time, will we be coming together as a nation or getting further apart? Will we set goals that all of us can help meet? Or will we turn on each other and pit one group of Americans against another? Now, our names will be on the ballot tomorrow, but those values and every issue you care about will be there, too. What kind of country do we want, and I particularly think about this for young people as I look at this crowd and see so many students and young Americans that deserve the same opportunities that many of us were given. We will make sure they are available because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving America, it comes down to a couple of key issues. If you believe that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote. We're going to make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, small business, clean energy, advanced manufacturing. We're going to actually deliver on that unlike my opponent, who makes his products mostly overseas, buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of what's made by American steelworkers right here in Pennsylvania. We're going to invest in America, and we're especially going to invest in communities that are left out and left behind. We're going to stand up for the right of workers to organize and bargain. We're going to get incomes rising across America. And if you believe we need a fairer economy as I do, then we're going to raise the national minimum wage, because no one who works full time in America should still be in poverty. And we're going to do more to support working families with affordable child care, paid leave, and finally, equal pay for women's work. I've got to tell you, this always get's about the biggest applause ever because fundamentally, we know it's not fair, but it's also about families. If you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter who's working, you don't want her shortchanged, do you? Now, when I talk about equal pay and all of these other family issues, my opponent says I'm playing the woman's card. Well, you know what I say: deal me in. If you believe all our kids should have good schools and good teachers, no matter what zip code they live in, then you have to vote. If you believe we can make college affordable for every young American, then you have got to vote. I've got to say, I was very proud of the primary campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign on issues and ideas, not insults. And after it was over, he and I got together, and we came up with this plan. Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than $125,000 a year. And it should be debt free for everybody else. I don't think you should go into this massive debt to get your education. It's good for you, it's good for your families, it's good for our country, and we're going to make it affordable for everyone. And for the millions of Americans already struggling with student debt, we're going to ease that burden. We're going to get those interest rates down, we're going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income, not tied to a six, eight, 10 percent interest rate, and you're never going to have to pay more than you can afford. You see, I think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about. And I think the agenda we've put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope. You see, working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now. So this has to be our mission together – doing all we can to help every American, especially every young American and especially every child, to have the chance to live up to your God-given potential. Because when it's all said and done, that's what matters the most. Have you helped somebody else? Have you reached out and tried to ease somebody's burden? We do it individually. My mother got through a neglected, abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness. Her own parents didn't want her. Her own grandparents didn't want her. But that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat, brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat. And when she was 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody's home, she was just relieved that she had somewhere to live and that she could support herself. But the mother of that home understood my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said, 'Dorothy, if you get up early and get your chores done, you can go to high school. You'll have to come right back because I'll need you, but you can do it.' And look, that sounds harsh to our ears, telling a 14 year old, 'Okay, you can go to high school but you have to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it.' But to my mother, it was a blessing. So when I think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we had had, and I'm speaking for myself, my mother gave me the resilience, the grit, the get up and go. She told me, 'Everyone gets knocked down. What matters is if you get back up.' And we had a lot of Americans knocked down because of the Great Recession, didn't we? Millions of jobs were lost, millions of homes were lost. Family wealth was wiped out, savings account, 401K's, everything that people had worked so hard for. Well we've dug ourselves out of the hole and now we need to get up, and we've got to make sure we don't leave anybody behind. I see this man here standing with a sign: 'Coal Miners for Hillary,' and I'll tell you sir, I know how hard times are. And as I have said, and you can take it to the bank, I will not forget you and I will do everything I can to help people who have given so much, worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country. We are not going to forget any American! But I can't do any of this without your help tomorrow. This election is going to really set the course of our country. There's no doubt in my mind. Tonight, I'll be in Philadelphia with President Obama and Michelle and I so appreciate how hard they worked for me, but it's not for me. It's for us. When President Obama came into office, put yourself in his shoes -- this young, dynamic, first African-American elected to become President of the United States. And what does he find? He finds the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, that's what he finds. Wow, those were hard, hard times. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didn't go even deeper in the ditch we were in. But make no mistake: there were reasons we ended up in that ditch. It didn't happen by accident. We had huge tax cuts on the wealthy, the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened. They ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened. Elections have consequences for everything we care about. And that's why we've got to each and every one of you put down your stake in our future. If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait. In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line, asking them, all types of Americans, not one type -- all types, 'Why are you here?' 'Because my future depends on it,' they say. So tomorrow is the election, but that is just beginning. We have to heal this country. We have to bring people together, listen and respect each other. Now I know it's unusual for somebody running for president to say this, I started saying this months ago, because I was literally meeting who were scared about what they were hearing in this election. I've known a lot of the Republicans who've run for president been elected president in recent history, I didn't agree with them on everything, obviously we had our differences, but I didn't doubt that they were fit to serve as president. This election is different. This person is temperamentally unqualified, experientially unqualified to be president and so many people know that. So I think we do need more love and kindness, right? We have to got to rise above all of this hate filled rhetoric, all of these insults and scapegoating and finger pointing and insulting. I want to be a president for all Americans. Not just some. I want to be the president for Democrats, Republicans and Independents. I want to be the president for those who vote for and those who vote against me. I want to represent everybody. Because I know we have a role to play in building a better future. So it starts tomorrow. If you don't know where to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can get all the information you need, the polls will be open from 7 AM to 8 PM. We are on track, as I said, to have a huge turnout. But we can only do that if all of you make up your minds, you bring all your friends, everybody you know, to make sure your voices are heard. This is a historic, historic election and we're going to do everything we can, not only to win, but then immediately to get to work. And I especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next 24 hours, go to hillaryclinton.com, text join, J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6, stop by one of our offices. We would love to see you. Because when your kids and grandkids ask what you in the future what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say: you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we finally prove once and for all that, yes, love trumps hate. Thank you.","UCSB"
"83",2016-11-09,"Hillary Clinton","Remarks in New York City Conceding the 2016 Presidential Election","Senator Tim Kaine: My wife, Anne, and I are so proud of Hillary Clinton. [applpause]I'm proud of Hillary Clinton because she has been and is a great history maker in every thing that she has done as a civil rights lawyer and first lady of Arkansas and first lady of this country and senator and secretary of state.She has made history. In a nation that is good at so many things, but that has made it uniquely difficult for women to be elected to federal office, she became the first major party nominee as a woman to be president and last night won the popular vote of Americans for the president. [applpause]That is an amazing accomplishment. It is an amazing accomplishment. I'm proud of Hillary Clinton because in the words of Langston Hughes, she's ""held fast to dreams."" She was inspired at a young age to an epiphany that if families and children do well, that's the best barometer of whether society does well. In everything she's done, she's focused on that.We know she would have made history as a president in one sense, but we never have had a president who's made their whole career about the empowerment of families and children. And I was as excited about that in the Oval Office as I was excited to have my friend Hillary there and make history as the first woman president.I'm excited and proud of Hillary because she has built such a wonderful team. There is a...[applpause]There's a beautiful and kind of comical parable in the New Testament about a vineyard owner who hires people to work and says I'm going to pay you this for a full day. Then he hires people at noon, I'm going to pay you the same thing for the half day. Then he hires people one hours work, I'm going to pay you the same. And those who started earlier in the day said hold on, we don't like this, that you're treating everybody who came late just as well as you're treating us.I'm going to tell you something, here's what I've come to know so well about Hillary. The team that she has assembled over the years of people that are so deeply loyal to her because she's so deeply loyal to them is inspiring. But I've seen that same degree of loyalty and compassion and sensitivity extended to the most recent folks who have joined the team, the folks who came to the vineyard with just one hour to go. Her loyalty and compassion of Hillary and Bill to people, if you're with you you're with you. And that is just something so remarkable.And finally, I'm proud of Hillary because she loves this country. [applpause]Nobody — nobody had to wonder about Hillary Clinton, whether she would accept an outcome of an election in our beautiful democracy. Nobody had to ask that question. Nobody had to doubt it. She knows our country for what it is. She knows the system that we have and its warts and blemishes. She's deeply in love with it and accepts it. She's been in battles before where if it didn't go her way she accepted it, but then woke up the next day and battled again for the dreams that she's held fast to. And that love of country is something that I think is obvious to everybody, obvious to everyone.I want to thank Hillary Clinton for asking Anne and I to join this wild ride. We — about a week before she asked if I would be her running mate, Anne and I went up to Westchester and we sat down with Hillary and Bill and with Chelsea and Mark and with Charlotte and Aiden for about three hours of conversation to try to determine whether we would be the right people to be on the ticket.And when we got in the car to head back to the airport after the three hour discussion, I said to Anne, ""Honey, I don't know whether we're going to be on this ticket or not, but I do know this, we're going to remember that three hours for the rest of our life."" And now, we've — we'll remember 105 days that we've had with this fantastic couple of public servants and all of you for the rest of our life.I'll just say this. Hillary and I know well the wisdom and the words of William Faulkner. He said, ""They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yet."" [applpause]""They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yet,"" because we know that the work remains. We know that the dreams of empowering families and children remain. And in that work, that important work that we have to do as a nation, it is so comforting even at a tough time to know that Hillary Clinton is somebody until her very last breath is going to be battling for the values that make this nation great and the values that we care so deeply about.So now, please join me in welcoming Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton. [applpause]Secretary Clinton: Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. [applpause]Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. [applpause]Very rowdy group. Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so very much for being here and I love you all, too.Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together, this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life. [applpause]I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person or even one election, it was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted.We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them. [applpause]Now — and let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years but all the time. So let's do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear; making our economy work for everyone not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams.We've spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone — for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. For everyone. [applpause]So now, our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will.I am so grateful to stand with all of you. I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. [applpause]It has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy representing Virginia in the Senate. [applpause]To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude. [applpause]We — we thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world.And to Bill and Chelsea, Mark, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most — even four-month-old Aidan who traveled with his mom.I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country. [applpause]You poured your hearts into this campaign. For some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns. Some of you, it was your first campaign. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted. [applpause]And to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook, even in secret, private Facebook sites...[laughter and applause]...I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward. [applpause]To everyone who sent in contributions as small at $5 and kept us going, thank you. Thank you from all of us.And to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have, as Tim said, spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I've had successes and I've had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it. [applpause]It is — it is worth it. [applpause]And so we need — we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. [applpause]Now, I — I know — I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. [applpause]And — and to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.Finally...[applpause]Finally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American. And I still believe as deeply as I ever have that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us. [applpause]Because, you know — you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that. You know, scripture tells us, ""Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap if we do not lose heart.""So my friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do.I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election.May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.","UCSB"
"84",2016-06-13,"Donald Trump","Remarks at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire","Thank you for joining me today.This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country's history.So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.The horror is beyond description.The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.We mourn, as one people, for our nation's loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it.I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.[SILENCE]Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.This is a very dark moment in America's history.A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people – with force, purpose and determination.But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart – and fast – we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don't share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.It's not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans – women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.The male shooter in San Bernardino – again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.Yet, Hillary Clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words ""radical Islam,"" until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.However, Hillary Clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won't speak honestly about what it is.She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: ""Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.""Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.In fact, Hillary Clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss – it's deadly.The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.I refuse to be politically correct.I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials – and with our allies.I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done.We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.These Departments refused to comply.President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.The public has a right to know how these people got here.We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups?Truly, our President doesn't know what he is doing. He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.We can't let this happen.Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.Wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States – we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.What I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.We've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women, and murder gays.I don't want them in our country.The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.We need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us – is brought to justice.If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .America must do more – much more – to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.It also means we must change our foreign policy.The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.We've tried it President Obama's way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.America will be a tolerant and open society.America will also be a safe society.We will protect our borders at home.We will defeat ISIS overseas.We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.We will make America rich again.We will make America safe again.We will make American Great Again.Thank you.The media talks about ""homegrown,"" terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn't share their views.She can't have it both ways. She can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.How does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better?Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here—in vast numbers—who reject our values?Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities – all of our communities.America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven't budged in many years.So whether it's matter of national security, or financial security, we can't afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are.I want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.I want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens.","UCSB"
"85",2016-06-22,"Donald Trump","Remarks at Trump SoHo in New York City","Today I'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.People have asked me why I am running for President.I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.We come to work together and turn visions into reality.We think big, and then we make it happen.I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton – only by me.The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.Because it's not just the political system that's rigged. It's the whole economy.It's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.It's rigged against you, the American people.Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar –just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.Here is my promise to the American voter:If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests.Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund – doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.They totally own her, and that will never change.The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.Those are the stakes.Hillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.She believes she is entitled to the office.Her campaign slogan is ""I'm with her.""You know what my response to that is? I'm with you: the American people.She thinks it's all about her.I know it's all about you – I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what's good for America's middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.That's what we mean by America First.Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.Our Founders understood this.One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for ""the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]"" in America.Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:""The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.""I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.We've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – a crime which is continuing to this day.Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.She gets rich making you poor.Here is a quote from the book: ""At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.""These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas – and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book – deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn't change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career – and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.It's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars – and unleashed ISIS across the world.No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.Hillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.Here is what one of the victim's mothers had to say:""I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don't want this person to be president.""In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.Libya was cooperating.Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.Syria was under control.Iran was being choked by sanctions.Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.ISIS wasn't even on the map.Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managedto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.Hillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen – while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam.Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality – and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.In short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya.She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:""She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true…Her leadership style – volcanic, impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else – hasn't changed a bit.""Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth – with no way to screen who they are or what they believe. Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.Here is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access – even though he had no national security credentials.Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State – plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments – perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China – putting all of America in danger.Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.We can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.National security is also immigration security – and Hillary wants neither.Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter:""Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms' way – an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.""Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can't claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobsStand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are manyCancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseasLift restrictions on energy productionRepeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.There is one common theme in all of these reforms.It's going to be America First.This is why the stakes in November are so great.On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.The voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don't need or want another Clinton or Obama.Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.Hillary Clinton's message is old and tired. Her message is that can't change.My message is that things have to change – and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.Then we started thinking small.We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.But that's not who we are.Come this November, we can bring America back – bigger and better, and stronger than ever.We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth – the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment – we will bring it back all the way.Massive new factories will come roaring into our country – breathing life and hope into our communities.Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.Our country is going to start working again.People are going to start working again.Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again – including parents in our inner cities.Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.We are going to make America rich again.We are going to make America safe again.We are going to make America Great Again – and Great Again For EVERYONE.","UCSB"
"86",2016-07-11,"Donald Trump","Remarks in Virginia Beach, Virginia","Thank you.I'd like to thank Chairman Jeff Miller for his leadership on behalf of those who have served this country in military uniform, and for working with our campaign on developing real solutions for our great Veterans.Before going further today, however, I would first like to address the contributions of another group who serve this country in uniform: the men and women in blue.Our Police Officers rush into danger every day to protect our communities, and they often do it thanklessly and under relentless criticism.They save thousands of lives every year, perform countless public services every day, and yet their names will likely never appear in a single headline or media report.But I want our nation's police to know, that we thank you, and we support you, and we will always stand with you.The attack on our Dallas police is an attack on our country.Our whole nation is in mourning, and will be for a very long time.Yet, we've also seen increasing threats against our police and a substantial rise in the number of officers killed in the line of duty.America's police and law enforcement personnel are what separates civilization from total chaos – and the destruction of our country as we know it.We must remember, the police are needed the most where crime is the highest. Politicians and activists who seek to remove police or policing from a community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable Americans.It is time for the hostility against our police, and against all members of law enforcement, to end – and to end right now.We went through an ugly chapter in our history, during Vietnam, when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas. For too many police today, that is their daily reality.At the same time, the tragic deaths in Louisiana and Minnesota make clear the work that must be done to ensure every American feels that their safety is protected. We were all disturbed by the images we saw.We must discuss, as well, the ongoing catastrophe of crime in our inner cities. According to the Chicago Tribune, there has already been more than 2,000 shooting victims in Chicago this year alone. This epidemic of violence destroys lives, destroys communities, and destroys opportunity for young Americans.Violent crime has increased in cities across America. The New York Times described ""a startling rise in murders,"" in our major cities.Brutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into Virginia and Maryland.Too many Americans are trapped in fear, violence and poverty.Our inner cities have been left behind, and I am going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home, safe school and safe community.We must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country.I am the law and order candidate.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is weak, ineffective, pandering, and, as proven by her recent email scandal, which was an embarrassment not only to her, but to the nation as a whole, she is either a liar or grossly incompetent.Personally, I think she is both.Not only am I the law and order candidate, but I am also the candidate of compassion. But you can't have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of the United States. Every kid in America should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood.Everyone will be protected equally and treated justly, without prejudice.We will be tough, we will be smart, we will be fair – and we will protect all Americans.Without safety, we have nothing!It is the job of the next President to Make America Safe Again — For Everyone.That promise of protection must include taking care of every last Veteran, which was going to be the sole topic of today's speech prior to the attack in Dallas.The men and women who have served in our armed forces represent the very best of America.Now is the time to follow their example of unity, public service and selfless devotion to our country.We made a promise to these heroes. You defend America, and America will defend you.But that promise has been broken by our politicians, like so many other promises our country has made – not only to its veterans, but to its citizens as a whole.President Obama has allowed our Veterans Affairs health care system to deny help and support to those who deserve it most.Hillary Clinton recently said of the VA scandal that ""it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be.""She actually thinks that the Veterans Health Administration is well run – that's because she has been part of the rigged system.Perhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives – instead of spending time with real people in real pain.The disconnect in America is deep.There are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else.The VA scandals that have occurred on this Administration's watch are widespread and inexcusable.An internal memo from a senior VA official describes ""lawlessness and chaos,"" at the Veterans Health Administration, including the payments of $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules.The memo also says they ""waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws"" and warns that ""these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to America's Veterans.""Even the White House's own Deputy Chief of Staff described ""significant and chronic systemic failures,"" in Veterans Affairs, including ""a corrosive culture that has led to personnel problems across the Department,"" with ""poor management,"" and ""a history of retaliation toward employees raising issues."" He said there is a ""lack of accountability across all grade levels.""Here are just a few examples:--Forty veterans died waiting for care in Phoenix.--Forty different VA facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times.--A VA employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff, as was a convicted sex offender.--The VA spent $8 million on solar panels for a facility knowing they would likely need to be torn down.--The St. Cloud, Minn. VA built a $2.3 million wind turbine in April 2011 that hasn't supplied power since 2012.Can you imagine the waste and corruption we'll find when we begin a full investigation in January of 2017?Most of those responsible have still not been held to account.Fixing this corruption will be one of my highest priorities – and it will happen. It will be fixed.That begins with a simple promise: every Veteran will get timely access to top-quality careVeterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center.We must extend this right to all Veterans– not just those who can't get an appointment in 30 days, or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is the current policy.This promise includes guaranteed access to the best available healthcare services for our female Veterans.We must also do more to help our Veterans find jobsEvery year, large corporations bring in many thousands of low-wage workers from overseas, and across the border, to fill jobs that could easily be filled by our Veterans.Veterans should come first in the country they fought to protect, and under a Trump Administration they will -- America First, Veterans First.Veterans' health care must also include the best mental health care.A shocking 20 Veterans are committing suicide each day, especially our older Veterans.This is a national tragedy.The evidence shows that if Veterans are in the system, receiving care, they are much less likely to take their own lives than Veterans outside the system.That is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the VA – while ensuring that Veterans can access private mental health care as well.America must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large. This includes expanding the number of facilities, integrating primary care and mental care professionals, reforming confinement rules, and making it easier for family members who see warning signs to get their loved ones the care they need – especially in emergencies.One of the most important reforms we can make is accountabilityRight now, when VA employees fail our Veterans, you can't discipline them.That's because of outdated civil service rules in need of reform.In fact, employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions.In 2014, the VA awarded $142 million in bonuses to its employees, including bonuses to the executives who oversaw construction of the Denver VA hospital that was more than $1 billion over budget.Two other VA executives even abused their authority to obtain $400,000 in relocation benefits.It doesn't have to be this way.As Veteran Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller said: ""The VA is not sacred. The Veteran is.""Here is my 10 step plan to ensure quality, timely care for every Veteran in America:One:I will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the VA.The Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our Veterans – not bureaucrats, not politicians, but Veterans. Amazingly, President Obama's VA Secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at Disneyland.Two:I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail our Veterans or breach the public trust.Three:I am going to ask Congress to pass legislation that ensures the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health, safety or well-being of any Veteran.Four:I am going to appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for bold legislative reform.Five:I am going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the VA have their jobs protected, and are put in line for promotions.Six:I will create a private White House Hotline – that is answered by a real person 24 hours a day – to ensure that no valid complaint about VA wrongdoing falls through the cracks.I will instruct my staff that if a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me, and I will pick up the phone and fix it myself, if need be.That's a promise.Seven:We are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money, and start giving bonuses to people for improving service, saving lives and cutting waste.If an employee finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates better outcomes for our Veterans, then a small, responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to taxpayers.Eight:We are going to reform our visa programs to ensure American Veterans are in the front, not back, of the line.Nine:We are going to increase the number of mental health care professionals, and increase outreach to Veterans outside of the system.Ten:We are going to ensure every Veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the VA, or to seek private medical care paid for by our government.Never again will we allow a Veteran to suffer or die waiting for the care they so richly deserve.We need to clean out the corruption in Government, and Hillary Clinton will never be able to do itShe is incompetent, and has proven that time and time again.Crooked Hillary Clinton is the Secretary of the Status Quo – and wherever Hillary Clinton goes, corruption and scandal follow.Our country needs change, and she will never give us change.The fact is, she helped create our rigged system.Hillary Clinton's America is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment.The rigged system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of America at risk.Hillary Clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and to bypass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials.In other words, she was willing to risk our foreign enemies reading her emails as long as the voting American public could not.Her conduct was willful, intentional, and unlawful – and her repeated false statements about her conduct prove that she was fully aware of her guilt.This was not just extreme carelessness with classified material – which is still totally disqualifying. This is calculated, deliberate, premeditated misconduct – followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to Congress, the media and the American people.In fact, when the FBI interviewed her for only 3 hours during the 4th of July weekend, her interview was not recorded, and she was, amazingly, not even put under oath.She carried out her dangerous email scheme at the same time as her bad judgement and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing ISIS across the world.Afterwards, as a further demonstration of guilt, Hillary Clinton erased more than thirty thousand emails as part of the cover-up.The fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment.When thinking about her e-mail destruction, let's not forget: many foreign and corporate entities, and other special interests, with business before Hillary Clinton's State Department were making massive financial contributions. These contributions were made to both the Clinton Foundation and to the Clintons directly.If elected, Hillary Clinton would become the first President of the United States who wouldn't be able to pass a background check.Just look at what the FBI Director said about her – her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country.Clearly, Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.The decades of decay, division and decline will come to an end.The years of American Greatness will return.We are going to become, for the first time in a long time, one united country.We are going to make American Great Again – And Safe Again – For All Americans.We will dream big and bold and daring things once more.Let me conclude by paying tribute to every single American hero who has served this country, and most especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice.Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting.We are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have fought for us.We will be a safe, strong, and proud country once again.Thank you.","UCSB"
"87",2016-07-16,"Donald Trump","Remarks Introducing Governor Mike Pence as the 2016 Republican Vice Presidential Nominee in New York City","Thank you, everybody. Great honor. Great honor, thank you. This is a wonderful day. Aww. [Chants of Trump, Trump, Trump] Wow.  On a Saturday morning yet. Isn't that nice? Thank you, all. And we're going to have an incredible convention. It's really going well. We're going to have an incredible convention. And we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly. So I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system -- we are in a rigged, rigged system -- and to make America safe again and to make America great again. I want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France. We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look. And now it's happening more and more. And it's never going to stop. We need new leadership. We need new thinking. We need strength. We need in our country law and order. And if I'm elected president, that will happen. [applause] I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation. And as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people. We wish them well. It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well. A lot of -- a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out. Now, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years. The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before. Never been like this. Out of control. After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path. He didn't know what he was doing. Iraq, Syria, all into chaos. And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons. And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end. Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems. We also need to bring back in this country -- because we see what happened -- our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs. They've been taken away, like we're babies. Taken away. And we're going to bring them back. I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous -- really prosperous society for all Americans. Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice. I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana. And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute. But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you. He is a solid, solid person. [applause] Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress. He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference. Number one. He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration. It's horrible out there. High taxes and regulations. And it's out of control. Mike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty. We know that. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption. She's a corrupt person. What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads. She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent. She's crooked Hillary. [applause] And I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails -- but it wasn't a loss, she discarded -- that in itself is a major crime. Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton. Thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's OK? Didn't give them to the FBI? Didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's OK? Wipes her server clean, that's OK? These are crimes. These are crimes. And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don't. But I do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around. She's going to pay it at the polls. I believe that. [applause] On top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time. She's totally owned by Wall Street. We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism. And it's not that she believes in it. The people that give her all of this money believe in it. And she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe. Believe me. That's it. [applause] What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence. [applause] Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam. Radical Islamic terrorism. You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window. You heard what he was screaming out the window. You saw it in San Bernardino. You saw it at the World Trade Center. You saw it in Orlando. How horrible was that? You saw it in Paris. You see it all over. And Hillary is a weak person. We are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party. We're going to change things around. There's going to be respect again for law and order. [applause] Hillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch ISIS. You know, she's talking -- I see the ads she puts on. If I make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests. Got a lot of money. But I see the ads on foreign policy. She's talking about Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience. Of course not. I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson. I mean -- but -- but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq. Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson. I was a civilian. Take the oil. Many, many calls I've made. You take a look. I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen. I was the one that predicted it. And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong. President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win. I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do. And they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from. And I said that Brexit's going to happen. I said that they are going to break away. And everybody laughed at me. And the odds were 20 percent. And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen. And some of the more fair reporters -- about 30 percent of them -- said he was right. I appreciate that. Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK. So Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy. So important. Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike -- and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest. So many people have said party unity. Because I'm an outsider. I want to be an outsider. I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides. I won in landslides. This wasn't close. This wasn't close. [applause] No, this wasn't close. This was -- in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three. There were 17. We got -- I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger -- I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger -- we got almost 14 million votes. That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president. Think of it. That's more than Ronald Reagan, who we love. That's more than Richard Nixon. It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower. You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness. Pretty good. It's more than the Bushes. But I mean by a lot. I don't mean by a little. But that's with 17 people. People don't over-say that. That means our message is unbelievable. And I want to thank all of the loyal people -- because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing. But they displayed it. It was on display, where we had this group of people, who -- many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK? Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump. Oh, we're going to win. They got crushed. And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen. They're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start -- and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers. We're going to put 'em back to work. [applause] So they're very tired of it. But I want to thank all of those people that – delegates-- that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something. Did we show them something. And unfortunately, the vote was very late. But essentially, we had 112-12. This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight. We're not going to have a fight. People agree with what we've -- they want the wall. They want the borders. They want these things to happen. And what we're doing... [applause] And what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud -- and nobody else would even think about doing it -- I fought very hard for it. We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals -- and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination. The evangelicals have been unbelievable. I dominated with the evangelicals. A lot of people were surprised. They say he's not perfect. But you know what? They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart. [applause] And I said -- and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do. You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group. And he was a powerful president. He knew how to get things done. He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him. But he was a powerful president. And we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status. We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment. And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk. I saw this. I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top -- the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders -- people are going to be surprised to hear that -- I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid? And they didn't know how to answer the question. And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out. One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues. We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political. And I looked out the window. I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street. I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't. That means they're more powerful than you are. We have to do something about it. How did it start? How did it start? [applause] And they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson. And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader. And he did this, and he got it done. And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people--and not because they backed me in such large numbers-- but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away. And we're going to change that. OK? All right. [applause] Back to Mike Pence. So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big. Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall. That's where Trump was going down -- they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places. But Indiana was going to be the firewall. So I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before. NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton. NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country. Manufacturing down in some states 55, 60 percent. It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places. I have a friend who's a great builder. What he builds is plants. That's all he does, is build plants. He doesn't build buildings. He doesn't -- he builds plants. It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear. I said, how's business? I was with him the other day. How's business? He goes unbelievable. I said, really, wow, I'm surprised. Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country. He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe. I said, what do you mean? He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen. I said, what about this country? Not much. Not much. That's the expression. He said exactly that. Not much. I said, but Mexico? He said, you've never seen anything like it. It's incredible. Folks, that's going to stop. We're going to go reverse it. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country. We can't be the stupid people anymore. OK? [applause] And he was better than a pollster. He's better than a consultant. I would say, how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars. Doesn't cost me millions. Me, I give them $10,000, OK? [laughter] It costs other people millions. It costs other campaigns millions to get a report. Every time they get a report, it's millions. But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report. And he said it. He didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it. Just fact. How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico. In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it. And if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan. We want them to build them in Michigan. They're going to build them in Michigan. And you know that I know how to do that. So easy. So easy. But they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution. There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here. There are consequences. And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country. It's very simple. And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike. [laughter] Indiana's unemployment rate -- and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family -- Karen is amazing. [applause] Incredible family. Highly respected. Expected to go for another four years. He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana. Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen. When he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016. Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states. I've gone to all of them. And every time, I have statisticians. I say give me the stats on a state. And it's always bad, down, down, down. Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases. Here's somebody where it's gone up. Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013. That's like very unusual. Governor Pence balanced the budget. Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing. We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion. He balanced the budget. They don't know what that means. Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana. It's also rated triple-A, their bonds are rated triple-A. Very few states have that. Triple-A. The best. That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, triple-A. Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business. Number one. And it's not even close. There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office. So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana. And besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me. I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I'm saying. He loves the governor. Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind. [applause] If you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said the, really -- they're doing much better, the V.A. is much better. They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for. People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors. People are dying on -- they can't even see a doctor. It's a scandal. Take a look at what's happening with the V.A. in Arizona. Take a look at what's happening with -- you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals. It's a scandal. It's corrupt. It's incompetent. It's a scandal. And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine. And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans. I mean, we know that for a fact. [applause] So it's now 2.4 percent for veterans. In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent. It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best. Got 'em jobs. Got 'em jobs. Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates. That's a great thing. They're going to stay there. That's a great thing. And Mike worked hard on that. He was telling me, that was not easy. Under Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K-12 education funding increase in the state's history. So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education. Isn't that a great thing? [applause] Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America. School choice is where it's at, folks. You want to get your schools better, you gotta get rid of Common Core fast. Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history. Think of that. We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets. And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country. CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure. So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up. That had so much -- look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump. I build infrastructure. Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure? You know, it's very interesting. We're building -- we're building -- I won -- the -- which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing -- probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services. And I really like what's happened. We're going to have an opening very soon. Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it. But I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year -- actually more than a year – but we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially. And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do. [applause] And when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before. They've never heard them. So when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work -- also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke -- who's now at Purdue -- when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened -- almost has not happened in this whole country. The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there. And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide. And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember. He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted -- who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy -- but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump. I said, who did he endorse? So even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non-endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK? I will tell you. [applause] So with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [applause]","UCSB"
"88",2016-07-21,"Donald Trump","Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio","Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon – and I mean very soon – come to an end.Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.These are the facts:Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are now not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone. We're going to fix that.The budget is no better.President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames. America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.Let's defeat her in November, OK.I am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control.After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect, the respect we deserve. The American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me, it's for their benefit.Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change...never ever. My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.I am your voice!I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.[disruption in the audience] How great are our police? And how great is Cleveland?I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way, and I won't look the other way.And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent,"" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes.In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip us of our jobs, and strip us of our wealth as a country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me, believe me. I will work with, and appoint, the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.This Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember: it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them at every level.When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America? Any other child.To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we are going to defeat them fast.Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many, many other locations.Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community – no good and we're going to stop it.As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology – beleive me.And as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel. Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this. Think of this. This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border, which we can solve. We have to solve it.These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain, believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine, and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh, it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so so horribly?These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say.On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class.I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat, of which there are many. It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the richest people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or, frankly, any other country.Never, ever again.I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore.My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it's not going to happen. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. I will never, ever sign bad trade deals. America fist, again! America first! Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get the deal that we want. We are going to start building and making things again.Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, and I mean everyone.America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it will happen, and it will happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald Trump as President. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing, and that's what she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports which is a total disaster! Thank you. Thank you.We are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in line and dying.My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.The replacement for our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what, the support they have given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. So true. They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job? My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.Remember: All of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people that wouldn't stand -- I mean, they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? Love it, love it, love it. No longer can we rely on those same people in politics and in the media, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now.It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: ""I'm With Her"". I choose to recite a different pledge.My pledge reads: ""I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.""I am your voice.So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.God bless you, and good night! I love you!","UCSB"
"92",2016-08-09,"Donald Trump","Remarks at a Rally at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington","Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause] Thank you very much. So amazing. Rudy just left. He just said, ""I don't believe this. This is unbelievable."" Nobody believes it.The crowds we're getting -- I'm the messenger, but I'll tell you what, the message is the right message. We're tired of incompetence. We're tired of not taking care of our military. We're tired of not taking care of our vets, who are being taken care of very poorly.We're tired of so many different things. And this is what happens. So, our mayor, my friend, Rudy Giuliani just walks, I'm telling you, he said, ""I don't believe this. This is incredible.""And what he hasn't seen, and your governor, by the way, who's a great guy.And he's now seeing it, they're walking outside because there are thousands of people outside that can't get in. I said, ""Rudy, you think this is bad, go take a look outside.""So I just want to thank Pat and Rudy and I want to thank everybody for being here. And we are going to have a good time. We love North Carolina. We love North Carolina [applause]We did really well in the primaries if you remember, and I hear we are doing really well now. We have to win. That November 8 day is so important.You know, I bring things up like the judges right? Supreme Court Justices, we have to get - you know, you could have as many as four? I guess it's a scenario where this president could pick five Supreme Court Justices.And if you pick two that are left, left, left, it's going to be a disaster for our country. Your Second Amendment, the National Rifle Association endorsed and they endorsed me early, a long time ago. And they're great people, Wayne and Chris, they are great people. [applause]But if you - if you do something with these - I'll tell you what, Justices right now, you lost a great one with Scalia. We want to replace with Justices very much like Justice Scalia and that's going to happen. It is so important.So if for no other reason, I mean it's such an important - it's one of the most important elections for a lot of reasons, not just that but for a lot of reasons. But that's so obviously, because for whatever reason, they say this could be the presidency. This next four years is where you will pick more Supreme Court Justices than anybody has every had the opportunity to do. Believe me, I'll make you very proud of those Justices everyday. [applause]So we had an incident a few days ago with the $400 million - all cash, right -- $400 million in all cash, anybody know what that looks like? That's a lot of cash. That's a lot of case.And honestly, it's so sad. Think of it, going to Iran, a terrorist state. Now I happen to think they have plenty of money, we've given then $150 billion, so the $400 million is just, you know - I happen to think it goes into their accounts in Switzerland personally.Now, a lot of people say, ""no, no, it's used for terror,"" and they use it for terror because it's the number one terror funder - not even close. But I also think that when you have $400 million in cash, different denominations, do you see the size of this? I guess they did release the pictures after all. They released pictures.And interesting I'll tell you, I sort of think it goes into bank accounts, right? You know, I sort of think they take it, they probably use some for this, some for that. You can do a lot of things.And Obama said that he did it because we don't have a working account with Iran. Do you believe that? How long does it take to set up an account? Right? You don't have a working account, you set up an account, right?You set up an account and it takes about - look, what's going on in this country - folks, folks, what's going on in this country is insane. And we have people running our country that don't know what they're doing, they're grossly incompetent, and it's time. We have to make change, real change. Not Obama change, we have to make change.Whether it's Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl who was a traitor, and they get five of the greatest killers that they've wanted for eight years. We get Bergdahl -- I call it the five for one trade. For the Iran deal, where we get nothing, we get nothing.They get ultimately, they have the path, beautiful path, they'll get way, way earlier than that. They'll get nuclear weapons, so if you get Trump you're going to see a lot of changes to that deal. That'll happen fast. [applause]You're going to see some big changes and what I really -- I mean, I saw where President Obama said that the $400 million in cash was not, had nothing to do with the release of the hostages, right? It really doesn't work, does it? Does it? I mean, remember Obamacare, ""you're going to keep your doctor, you're going to keep your plan, over and over again, you're going to keep your doctor."" It was a lie.And in fact, if he didn't make the lie, he would have never gotten it approved because most Democrats, many of the Democrats didn't want to do it. It was only that, that got them to sign it and to approve it. And it was a lie.And the $400 million, and from what the rumor is and from what the reports are, the hostages couldn't leave the airport until this other plane arrived. They don't know why, but I think we all have a pretty good reason why. It was all a big lie, it was all a big lie.And it's so sad to see, and let me tell you, Hillary Clinton is going to be four more years of Obama, but maybe worse. Maybe worse. There'll be four more years. Four more years of ISIS, four more years of high taxes. You know yesterday I had a -- at a big event, really. It turned out to be a very big event in Detroit [applause]Good event, very good. And we got wonderful reviews and a lot of good comments. But the thing I'm doing, I'm cutting taxes big league. Especially for the middle class and especially for businesses. Because businesses are dying and that means small businesses, businesses period. [applause] Businesses are leaving our country like they've never left before. They're going all over. They're going to Mexico, that I can tell you. Mexico is like the eighth wonder of the world. You know I've been telling a story, a friend of mine, good friend of mine, good guy. He builds plants, he builds plants for cars, for computers, you know where they make them. Massive plants. And I said to him, how are you doing?And he's worked in North Carolina, by the way. I said to him, how are you doing? He said phenomenal. He's like, ""I think the biggest in the world at this -"" that's what he does. Great guy. I said how's it all going? He said, 'you've got to see Mexico, Donald. It's the eighth wonder of the world. What we're building there is like, never has been built. We've never seen anything like it"". And I said, how are we doing in the United States? I'm more interested in that, OK? It's OK I guess. Right? You know, America first, folks. America first. America. [applause]Right, America first. [applause]America first. We get a little tired of these deals where they actually put, and you know why, because of lobbyists and special interests and people representing and people wanting it to happen. It's just not that they want other countries to benefit over us. There are reasons for it and you know, when I raise money, and I'm putting up a lot of money for my own campaign, I'm funding me. And I'm raising for the Republican party. And we're getting a lot of money from the small donors.Remember two months ago? Well, I hadn't started; I wanted to make sure I get the nomination before I start, right?Let me get the nomination, please. And then I took a lot of heat from the press, the world's most dishonest people, by the way. [applause] Terrible. [applause] Terrible. [applause]Those cameras will not move and show how many people are in this auditorium. Those cameras -- those cameras are not going on the move unless we have a protester, is there a protester up there in the quota? Any protesters? [laughter]If we had a protester that's the only time they move because they're showing something that in their mind is a bad thing, so then they move. But I like that, I've always liked my protesters because the cameras show these massive crowds and people say wow, was that a big crowd. You know, I go home to my wife, I say how's it going? She says darling, your speech was very good, were there many people there? I say yeah, about 7,000. That's a small group. Its only confined -- I mean you had to see outside. I felt so badly -- I came up -- I came up -- thank you and I love you too. Who said that? Who said that, huh? [applause]Thank you, thank you. But I came up with Rudy from New York and we're driving up and we're going block after block after block the line. And I said are those people going to be able to get in?They said the place is already full. And Rudy just said man; I've never seen anything like that. Maybe a couple of days before an election, but this is what's happening. Because of the fact we have a movement going, folks. Because people are so tired of them. [applause]They're so tired of them. [applause]So -- and by the way -- and by the way, voter ID, watch with that. Watch with voter ID, why aren't we having voter ID? In other words, I wanna vote, here's my identification, I wanna vote, as opposed to somebody coming up and voting 15 times for Hillary. [booing]Well -- and I will not tell you to vote 15 times. I will not tell you to do that, OK? [applause]You won't vote 15 times. But people will, they'll vote many times and how that could've happened , it's unbelievable. And the governor just told me that they're going before the United States Supreme Court Justice Roberts and maybe they can get a stay. Let's see what happens, OK? [applause]Let's see what happens. That's a very important thing. But I wrote a few things down and to me, so important -- yes, darling thank you. [laughter]Unstable Hillary lacks the judgment, now; Bernie Sanders said she lacks judgment, right? And nobody said anything about it, no problem. He said you lack judgment. And -- during one of the debates, nobody said, it was fine. When I say it they say that's terrible the way you talk. [laughter]She does, she lacks judgment, she lacks temperament and I'm the one that used unfit many, many months ago. And now they've turned it around, use it on me, unfit? I'm unfit? That's -- that's a first. But she lacks the temperament and the moral character to lead this country, its very simple. She really does. She's a dangerous person who doesn't tell the truth which has been proven very loudly.I've never seen a -- I don't think we've ever had greater proof of that, of anybody. [applause]And she has disregarded the lives of Americans -- you see what's happening -- with what she has done with her server? And you know why she did that.So, I just look at this, and I said that if she gets elected, she will cause the destruction of this country from within. Remember that. Remember that. [applause]She will -- she will allow people into our country that will do damage, they will do damage, folks. You look at what's going on in the world -- look at France; take a good look at France. I have friends that go to France. They used to love France. They say, no thank you. They don't expect to be going back anytime for a long time.I have one friend, I said, how was your trip this year to France? He said, France isn't France anymore. We're not going. And so many people are saying that. Look at what's going on with Germany. Look at what's happening with Germany. Look at the crime; look at the problems. We have enough problems in our country right now. We don't need additional problems, folks. We don't need additional problems. [applause]And for all we know, this could be the great Trojan Horse. This could be. We don't know who these people are.Now, they're coming in through Obama. And I looked at a chart yesterday, and it's like for years, it's sort of like this, a little uptick. And the last number or period of time, it's like, ""Wah, wah, wah, wah."" There -- I have never seen anything like it. They're letting them in, and again, you can't vet them. You don't know where they come from. We don't know -- look at the damage that two people in San Bernardino, probably radicalized the guy -- the woman coming in. Look at the damage in Orlando. Look at the damage that was done in Orlando by one wack job, one sick wack job. And you know what he was screaming? He's screaming what they all scream. And we have to get smart, folks. We don't need the problems -- and we've already got those problems, just so you understand. Because they're coming into the country, they're being put where nobody even knows where they are. It's like, if I were the enemy, I would say, I can't believe they're that stupid. They're taking my people and they're putting them all over the place, because you have great military right here. And our military...[applause]Our military cannot be beaten. But you know what could happen? When we don't know where they are, where they're coming, you've them all over the place. And folks, it's some. You don't need many; you don't need many. One person in Orlando. Two people -- look at in France, 130. Now, they have the strictest gun laws anywhere in the world, France, Paris. One hundred and thirty people killed, 130. And I've said 100 times, if this man or if this woman, or if that woman or man had a gun in Paris or in San Bernardino and the bullets were flying in the other direction, would have been a whole different story, folks. Would have been a whole different. [applause]For those -- for those foolish people that say Second Amendment, would have been a whole different -- and I'd go a step further. If these people, bad people, bad, sick, sick, sick people. If these people knew there were guns in the good guys hands, right, they probably wouldn't have gone in in the first place, all right? All right? Gun free -- what do you think of these gun- free zones?Do you know what a gun-free zone is? That's like -- they study where the gun-free zones -- if they would have known you had guns, if they would have known that they were going to be shot at from the other side, it would have been a whole different story. Maybe it wouldn't have even happened in the first place. So they better not come here. They better not. They better not. [applause]So recently a book came out a couple of weeks ago. A Secret Service agent made a statement because she said the other day she short-circuited. Hey, could you imagine if I said that ""I short circuited""? [laughter]They would be calling for my execution, -- electric chair. They'd bring back the electric chair. It would be a whole different ball game if I said it, believe me. But the Secret Service agent said, ""She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office,"" right?""From the bottom of my soul,"" he said, ""I know this to be true. Her leadership style, which is volcanic and impulsive, and she makes bad decisions. OK? Hey, you know, it's one thing to make bad decisions. It's another thing to be wacky and make bad decisions. [laughter and applause]She is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else and she hasn't changed a bit. This is -- that was the good thing. I couldn't say the bad things. It was too much. Nobody would even -- nobody would even believe it. You've got to see this book. Nobody would believe because it's so terrible, so terrible. And she comes across like this woman -- nice, easy -- but she's not. And -- and she's -- listen -- she's not a leader, not a leader. And she is a liar. [applause]Hey, hey -- 33,000 e-mails are gone. OK? 33,000 e-mails are gone. They're gone. How do you get rid of 33,000 e-mails? Who sends 33,000 e-mails? I mean, 33 -- do you know how many that is? I think that's like 24 hours a day reading them or sending them, but it wouldn't matter. For years, 33,000 e-mails are missing. And she's so guilty. She's so guilty. [applause]I think it's a tremendous blot in our country. I really mean that. I think what happened over the last two weeks with respect to her, especially in light of the fact that General Petraeus and many others have suffered unbelievable consequences. I think it's a tremendous blot on our country, a tremendous blot. Just remember that. But I just looked at this -- the economic failures of Obama and Clinton, et cetera. Obama-Clinton economic policies have produced 1.2 percent economic growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Now, this is, like, unbelievable -- 1.2. Do you know China goes to 7 percent or 8 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. Now, what they do is they cut their currency.They devalue their currency, and big league, and then all of our businesses continue to be drained out of the United States. Our money, our jobs. They make our product, they sell our product to us. No tax, no nothing, you devalue -- see devaluing is sort of cheating. You know, it's sort of like cheating. Now I have great relationships with China. I've done great business with China, I've done really well with China. I have these tenants, I sell condos, I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco with a group, a great group, thank you ma'am. [applause]Got to win -- got to win North Carolina. Thank you. [applause]Thank you. But they -- it's cheating, it's really cheating. And when I look at these trade deals -- it's so sad -- where we lose $800 billion -- billion with B -- dollars a year on trade with China alone, it's $400 billion and $500 billion and $505 billion. This is year in and year out, it's actually amazing that our country keeps going. But what has happened is, we have people in the audience, in 18 years, they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago, in real wages, 18. And in many cases, they're working two and three jobs, OK? But they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago. And those stats come right out, real wages. They're working harder, they're getting older. So in theory it's supposed to be the other way, you know you work and you're young, you don't care. Get a little older, it's like, oh by the way, how about me? I think I'm working harder too, if you want to know. [applause]I never worked this hard in my life. But I like it, I like it, I love it actually because I've met so many incredible people. You know I really got -- thank you -- I really got a tremendous understanding of this country. Because I'm going to places that I've heard about, I've known about, I'm stopping everywhere. And I see the carnage that NAFTA has caused, I see the carnage. It's been horrible. I see upstate New York, I see North Carolina, but I see every state. You look at New England. New England got really whacked. New England got hit. You look at Ohio, what happened there, and still happening. By the way, this isn't like it's going to happen or it's all over, it's getting worse. You look at Ohio, you look at Michigan, what's going on with the car plants being built in Mexico, is unbelievable. And more and more, you know they're moving. We were just talking about the autoworkers yesterday. Where they've lost over 100,000 autoworkers in Michigan, the state of Michigan, which is our car capital and it's really not the car capital anymore. Mexico will become the new car capital of the world in a very short period of time. No, think of it. And that's only because we allow it to happen. And I like Mexico. And I respect the leaders of Mexico because they're much smarter, they're much street smarter, but they're much smarter and more cunning than our leaders. But you have to see what's going on. And one of the reasons I won Indiana was Bobby Knight, because he's the best, he's the greatest. [applause]But one of the reasons is that Carrier Air Conditioning let 1,400 people go and they're building a plant in Mexico. And we're not going to let it happen . . .It's a suicidal pact for our country. And you know I've watched for years.I was never a politician until 14 months ago. So I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician. [applause]Can't believe it. [applause]But -- but I've been watching for years and I've watched as -- as the government tries to keep businesses from leaving our country and going to other countries. And I've seen low interest loans, I've seen zero interest loans, I've seen all sorts of subsidies. I get it. That stuff's not gonna work, that's not gonna work. What's gonna work is -- as an example, Carrier moves to Mexico and you wish him a lot of luck, good luck, have a nice plant. I hope my friend bills it, right? And then you know what happens? When they make their air conditioners -- and then think they're gonna sell that air conditioner, people living in Indianapolis -- where they come from -- for a similar price. And they think they're gonna sell it there and have no repercussions? With me, they have repercussions, OK? [applause]With me, they have repercussions. [applause]With me, we inform them that if you move, you're gonna pay a 35 percent tax on every single air conditioner that pour across our now very secure borders. [applause]And two things are gonna happen, one of two things -- one of two things are gonna happen. Number one, if you get them in time, they're not moving. Throws it all off-balance, since they're all off-kilter. Number one they're not -- now, nobody -- people would say well, why doesn't anybody use this? Why doesn't anybody mention it? I'll tell you why. Because they're controlled by their lobbyists, they're politicians. And Carrier goes out or whoever it might be this -- I'm just using Carrier as an example. Its hundreds and thousands. Its thousands of company. And millions of jobs we're talking about. I was looking at numbers -- I'm not gonna repeat the numbers because they'll say I was wrong, it can't be that high, I couldn't believe it was that high. But it's thousands of companies and millions and millions of jobs. And you'd say why aren't -- like, why doesn't somebody else say what Trump is saying? So I'm controlled by myself because I'm putting up my money, OK? I'm putting up my money. [applause]But...[applause]Although we raised, did you see $82 million last month, $82 million last month? [applause]And a lot of it -- a lot of the money was the small donations which Republicans never get. A lot of them -- I think it averaged $61 a hit, $61 can you imagine that? The total that we raised and in fact, in May I told you I was taking heat because they said Donald Trump didn't raise any money. And they told you why, right? I didn't raise it because I didn't know -- I gotta make sure I got the nomination. If I didn't get the nomination, I would've gone to Turnberry and played golf, OK? [laughter]In Scotland. But you know what? I got the nomination so now I had a start. And we raised $51 million in June, right? A lot of it in small donations and we raised $82 million in July. People are going, even the haters back there, the people that truly hate Trump -- they said, that's amazing. So we're doing all right. And people look, they want -- they wanna hear this message. Because this is a message this is an important message. But when you say -- and when you hear what I just said -- you charge a tariff or a tax. And guess what? And people said why hasn't the -- why haven't the politicians, they're smart, why haven't they done it? Because they're controlled by people that work for many of these companies and they're not gonna do it. Whether it's donors or whether its special interests or lobbyists they control because they want it to happen. And honestly, I think it's a total disgrace.I think it's a total disgrace for the millions of jobs, and for the thousands and thousands of companies that have left our country. If I were here to speak to every one of those companies for five minutes -- bye, bye. They were so quiet. You know, I like the Hillary protesters. You know why? They're so nice and quiet. The Bernie protesters were brutal; they were tough. Right? The Hillary protesters had no spirit. Did you see that? She starts screaming and the guy walks up, ""I'll go."" [laughter]The Bernie ones were -- they had a lot more spirit. I think we're going to get a lot of Bernie voters, if you want to know the truth. Because they do understand that trade is killing us. Trade. [applause]So, a few things, a few other facts I wrote, which I think are amazing. One is the 1.2 percent lowest in, you know, forget it. That's not a recovery. It's probably much -- don't forget, when they announced 1.2 percent, that means it's lower. And 1.2 is starting to set records. The national debt -- so, we're up to almost $20 trillion -- $20 trillion! The national debt under Obama has doubled. Think of it, doubled. Might be, I think by the time he gets out, it's going to more than double, but again, we have to very accurateBecause I'll say -- they'll say, well, it hasn't quite doubled. Believe me, by the time he gets out it will have more than doubled.The national debt has doubled. And you know the bad part about that? You think if the national debt has doubled, our infrastructure would be great, our country would be in great shapeWe'd have beautiful roads, beautiful highways. You see where like 50 percent of the bridges are in danger in this country. And the roadways are a mess.I have a friend, he's in the trucking business. He said, you know, for years, he had no problem. Now he buys these big, beautiful trucks, and the wheels get wiped out because of the potholes on the highways and things that he never had. So, you think with all of that doubling of the national debt, you'd really think that we'd be in good shape from the infrastructure standpoint, right? We're not. We're in very bad shape. U.S. trade deficit, $800 -- almost $800 billion. Nearly 24 million Americans in their prime earning years are out of the labor force, right?In the last seven years, another 14 million people have left the work force. Think of it. These are the real numbers, not the 5 percent nonsense.You know, you look for a job, you can't find your job, you go home, you share, you go to your parents, you go to your friends, you do whatever. You gave up, and now you're considered -- statistically, you're considered employed. Those people are not employed; these are great people. And there are plenty of them in here.I mean, we have great people. We have the most loyal people. We have the smartest people. You know, so many of my people, they're so smart.They like to say, well, Trump, I don't know if he's got this right -- let me tell you, we have the smartest people. We have the people that are the smartest, and the strongest, and the best and the hardest working. [applause]We have the smartest people. We'll put I.Q.s among -- some of us, we couldn't say all of us, right -- against any I.Q.s that we -- we have to deal with, . . .In the last seven years, 14 million. One in five American households do not have a single member in the workforce. Pretty bad.Homeownership -- this is one that is amazing to me -- today, homeownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.So you own homes, I mean it always used to be the dream to own a home, right? The American home.Lowest that its been in so many years, 51 years. Nearly 12 million people and more Americans are dependent on food stamps and 2 million more Latino Americans live in poverty under Obama and Clinton -- under Obama; because Clinton's just gonna carry on. You know, I don't know if you saw. I gave a massive tax decrease yesterday at regulations, we're gonna get rid of so many of them. But Clinton is gonna double your taxes; she's gonna double up your taxes. And she's trying to say well, I don't know like Trump's way -- she's gonna double up your taxes. You're gonna have massive tax increases is Clinton gets in. Enjoy -- enjoy it folks, if that happens. Fifty eight percent of African American youth are not employed. How sad is that? American households are earning $4,000 less -- listen to this one, today -- than they were 16 years ago. Many workers are earning less than 1970 in real dollars. So 1970 -- that's a long time ago, right? They're earning in real dollars less money. So under my plan, we're gonna create millions of new and really good paying jobs. You know, it's interesting because even the pro-Obama people say about the jobs that they're bad jobs. I've heard it from many of the people. They're trying to defend him. But they say they're bad jobs, they're not good jobs. The good jobs -- the good jobs have left. But we'll create millions of new good paying jobs but good jobs. That's so important, that's so important. [applause]Everyone's taxes will go down. Hillary Clinton has supported tax increases on the middle class for her entire career. She's voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate. That's all? I thought it was more than that, 235 times. I hope there's not a decimal point in there or so, 23.5 times. But I don't think there is -- voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate. Now, she's planning another job killing -- $1.3 trillion tax increase, that's what her tax increase is gonna be, folks. Like you're not paying enough, right? Her plan will tax many small business -- businesses who are already in deep trouble out of business. Then we have -- we will make -- and this is so important, this was an Ivanka Trump, OK? My daughter, so great. [applause]So great. [applause]We're gonna make childcare expenses tax deductible for working families. [applause]And just many, many other things. I mean, we're gonna make some unbelievable changes and it's -- it's so easy. Again, you know regulations -- I'm traveling all over and I'm meeting with business owners -- and beyond business owners, even people that work at the businesses, they're being laid off because of it. Regulations; if I told you -- and I'm so surprised, this is probably the biggest surprise -- if you have a small business and I said, you can have one or the other, a major tax cut like we're gonna -- you know, we're bringing it down to 15 percent from more than -- much more than double that. But if I told you that you could have a massive tax decrease or really substantially -- but in a real way -- cut regulations -- a hundred percent of the people I talk to would take the regulation, if you could only have one or the other. It's amazing, its amazing And that surprised me. Surprised you too? [applause]Surprised him, too. [applause]A hundred percent. I mean, everybody -- businesses can't form anymore, the tax -- the regulatory burden is so incredible that you can't form businesses -- very hard -- and businesses that are in existence are being put out of existence for regulations that don't do anything. We want safety regulations, we want environmental regulations. We're not, you know, people that don't want these things. We have to have that. We want clear air, we want clean water. We want clear water. But -- but...[applause]To do that -- and there are certain things that you want to do, but to do that, you don't have to destroy our country and destroy our businesses. [applause]So you know, I just wrote this down today. Hillary wants to raise taxes. It's a comparison. I want to lower them. Hillary wants to expand regulations, which she does big league. Can you believe that? I will reduce them very, very substantially. Could be as much as 70, 75 percent. [applause]Hillary wants to shut down energy production. I want to expand it. [applause]Lower electric -- lower electric bills, folks. Hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick... [booing] If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know. But -- but I'll tell you what. That will be a horrible day. If -- if Hillary gets to put her judges -- right now, we're tied. You see what's going on. you see what's going on? We tied because Scalia - this was not suppose to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years at least and this is what happens. That was a horrible thing. So now look at it. So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Now, speaking to the NRA folks - who are great - when you - when you -- and I'll tell you, they endorsed me. [applause]They endorsed me very early. My son's a member. I'm a member.If you - we can add I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the Justices - they almost go - in a certain way, hand in hand. Now the Justices are going to do things that are so important and we have such great Justices, you saw my list of 11 that have been vetted and respected. [applause]And have gotten great. And they to a little equate - but if you don't do the right thing, either you're not going to have a Second Amendment or you're not going to have much of it left. And you're not going to be able to protect yourself, which you needYou know, when the bad guys burst into your house, they're not looking about into Second Amendments, and, do I have the right to do this? OK, the bad guys aren't going to be giving up their weaponsBut the good people will say, ""oh, well, that's the law."" No, no, not going to happen, we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. [applause]Hillary Clinton wants to have totally open borders where people flow into our country. [booing]Where they flow into our country, and they take your jobs, and they do lots of things. And I want people to come into our country but they have to do it through a process, they have to do it legally, right? [applause]So you have drugs pouring in. You have everything coming in.You know, in New Hampshire, a great state, they have a tremendous heroin problem. I said to them, we will stop the drugs from pouring in to our country from the Southern border. They're going to stop. [applause]And by the way, we will build a wall. That's legal. [applause]Walls do work. Walls do work. [applause]Now here's one and you know -- I mean she doesn't look that way, but she is -- Hillary wants to invade foreign countries. That's what she does and look at the mess. So we've spent -- you know for two years, for three years, I've been saying we spent $2 trillion, right, in Iraq, more now, I guess. Somebody actually said to me the other day that they were talking about four or five trillion in the Middle East. And I'm going to get the accurate number. They don't know the accurate number, the truth is they have no idea. They have no idea what we're doing. We're sending equipment over, the enemies take it in. We sent over 2,300 Humvees that are totally armor plated. They got stolen by the enemy, 2,300. I thought they meant like two or 23. Or 230 was too much, 2,300 Humvees and they got stolen. They got taken by the enemy. You know, shot guns fired in the air, the ones we gave to the so-called allies, these great allies that we always pick, who end up being worse than the guys who we're trying to get out. [applause]So, terrible. Hillary and President Obama refused to use the term radical Islamic terrorism. Big problem. Big problem. Hillary wants to release violent criminals and criminal offenders from prison, that's wonderful, enjoy yourselves. I want to work with our police. Our police are so incredible, they're not getting the respect they deserve. [applause]Not getting the respect they deserve. [applause]And we're going to, in our country, restore law and order. We have to, we have to restore law and order. [applause]And the police are going to be careful and they're going to be studied and they're going to be -- but we have to restore law and order. What happened in Dallas, where all of those people were shot down. Absolutely, absolutely for no reason. Viciously shot down, and so many others. I was with one of the police groups the other day. They're endorsing me. Of like, eight other states in the last short while where the same, smaller number, but the same thing was happening where police are being killed. We have to respect and cherish our police. [applause]School choice we want, common core we don't want. We've got to get rid of common core, bring educational...[applause]And folks, and we have to re-negotiate with NAFTA. And by the way, going back to the wall, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. That I can tell you. [applause]Listen, you know these politicians, they don't know me. They don't understand me. And I am, I'm in a group of 50 people, these are real geniuses. These are 50 people that have been running our country forever and they said we can't support Donald Trump. The reason they can't, you know why, because I'm not going to hire these people, I don't want these people. Take a look. Take a look at what these people -- these are sort of like the people that have been involved with Washington, making decisions militarily on defense, on other things -- take a look what has happened in our country. Our military is depleted, our vets aren't taken care of. We can't beat ISIS. Can you imagine General George Patton, who is right now spinning in his grave, the great General Douglas MacArthur -- can you imagine -- and I say, because we have so many military people, and this is such a military state and I love it. [applause]I love. But can you imagine them seeing that we can't beat these 25 or 30,000 people, we can't beat them? We're fighting a political correct war.It's a political correct war. I mean, you know what's going on. You know what's going on. These are people that chop off heads. These are people that, in steel cages, drop steel cages into the waters and drowned large numbers of people. These are people that buried people in the sand. We've got to knock them out.I was against the war in Iraq. We shouldn't have been to the war in Iraq. It destabilized the Middle East and I said that was going to happen. But we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out. The way we got out was insane. And Obama gave a date, and he -- and that's how ISIS happened, folks. Hence, the birth of ISIS. [applause]Congratulations, Hillary Clinton. Congratulate -- I mean, she -- she should get -- if I'm ISIS, I call her up and I give her the most valuable player award. OK? [applause]And I guarantee you with Libya, which was her baby, and all of the other mistakes she has made. Obama takes now, because obviously, for him, that's the better alternative, all right? But he has been an incompetent president. He has done a horrible job. [applause] And I guarantee you that if he had it to it again -- and he would only say this to his wife -- but if he had it to do again, he would not have chosen Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state, because she made so many horrible mistakes and cost so many lives. And I mean lives on both sides. I'm not just saying -- I mean lives on both sides. She's inept; she's inept.And to think that she is even allowed to run for the presidency of the United States, when she deleted and got rid of 33,000 e-mails is an embarrassment to our country, and it always will be, OK? It always will be. [applause]So -- so, I want to thank all of you for being here. Look, I'm going to be around, and we're going to be coming to North Carolina a lot. Got to win it, very important [applause]But -- the people are great. My daughter-in-law comes from North Carolina. I'm here all the time. [applause]But -- but people -- the people are great. The military is great. We are going to make America great again. [applause]We're going to start winning. We're going to put America first. We're going to make America safe again.But never, ever forget, we are going to make America great again.Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I'll be back soon. Thank you. God bless you.","UCSB"
"98",2016-08-23,"Donald Trump","Remarks at Luedecke Arena in Austin, Texas","On November 8th, we are going to declare our independence from special interests, corrupt politicians, and from a rigged system that benefits only the insiders.We are going to declare our independence from media executives that don't care about us, and politicians who don't listen to us.We are going to declare our independence from rising crime, soaring poverty and crushing debt.We are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future.Once again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.It's going to be America First from now on.Let me tell you what this new future looks like.We are going to cut taxes and create millions of new jobs.We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.We are going to appoint judges who will support, defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States.We are going to save and cherish the 2nd amendment.We will ensure every Veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a VA facility, or with the private doctor of their choice.We're going to eliminate job-killing regulations.We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.Let's talk about another issue that is important to our future, and the future of our children.That's the issue of crime. Violent crime is rising across the country. More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year.No American should consider this level of crime acceptable. Every American has the right to live in safety and peace.A Trump Administration is going to restore law and order.Let me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers. This state has known unbelievable heartache in recent days after the murder of 5 police officers, and the wounding of another 7, in the assault on Dallas. We pray for the families, and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded.To all law enforcement in America: we are with you, we support you, and we will always stand with you.Together, we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land – but especially those who have not known safety in a very, very long time.That includes appointing an Attorney General and a Secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law.I will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people.I will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear.All citizens deserve to be protected. No American left behind.I want every African-American parent in this country – and all parents in this country – to be able to raise their kids in safety.And I want to ensure every African-American child in this country – and all children in this country – are put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.We are going to have school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers. My opponent, Hillary Clinton, discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice because she is owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy.No one owns me. I answer only to the American people.In a New York Post column, Deroy Murdock, published data confirming what I've been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities. Murdock confirms these facts:""The overall labor force participation rate for black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent to 61.2 percent — down 3.2 percent.This metric also slumped for black teenagers, from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent — down 6.4 percent.The percentage of black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama, the Census Bureau reports, from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014 — up 1.6 percent.The number of blacks on Food Stamps soared under Obama — from 7.4 million in 2009 to 11.7 million in 2014 — up 58.2 percent.Also, from Obama's arrival through last June 30, the percentage of black Americans who own homes plunged from 46.1 to 41.7 percent, the Census reports — down 9.5 percent.""Nearly 4 in 10 African American children live in poverty. 58 percent of young African Americans are not employed.Homicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore. Violent crime rose 17 percent in the fifty largest US cities.This is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.To those suffering I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?Let me also tell you what you have to gain: more jobs, higher wages, and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities.We are going to turn it all around. Success must be created for everyone, and available to everyone.That is how we are going to create a New American Future.But to make every American safe and prosperous, we must address one of the most vital issues of all: Border Security.We are going to build a wall.We are going to enforce the law.We are going to protect your jobs and wages.And we are going to keep our country safe.According to the Texas government, nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft.Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a totally, completely open border.She wants catch-and-release.Obamacare for illegal immigrants.Massive amnesty in her first 100 days.She wants to gut immigration enforcement.She supports Sanctuary Cities.She wants to let people overstay their visas without removal.One lawless order after another.We must not let it happen.Hillary Clinton also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9/11, and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston Bombing, San Bernardino and Orlando. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wider.I want to create safe zones in the Middle East. My plan suspends visas when we can't perform effective screening, and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who don't support our values. After all, that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about.This election will decide whether or not we have a border.This election will decide whether or not we have a country.Today I met with the moms of American children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies Hillary Clinton supports. Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families, she will never hear these stories.These are all forgotten Americans – they are not Hollywood or media stars, or big money special interest donors.She is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests.This corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy. Every day more and more alarming facts come out.The scandal I speak of is the State Department's Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton.If our Secretary of State can be bought, or bribed, or sell or trade government favors, then the whole American system is threatened.It is a threat to the foundation of Democracy itself. This is what happens in a Third World country – it's the failed conditions people flee when they come to America.America can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash.The new revelations about Hillary Clinton's email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.Hillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes. That's why she deleted 33,000 emails. That's also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public.She said she never sent or received classified materials.That was a lie, proved over and over again.She claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device. But she used multiple devices.Another lie.Under penalty of perjury, she said she turned over all of her work-related emails. But the FBI found thousands she never turned over, and now just found another 15,000 more.Another Clinton lie.She said she sent nothing marked classified.A total lie, unmasked to the world. And more to come.She said her server was secure, and had no breaches. But we know now it was completely unsecure, and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies.More Clinton lies.Clinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them.One more Hillary Clinton lie.Lie after lie after lie.Hillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office.It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons' set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.It goes back to the Arkansas days, and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors.But once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business – or, more accurately, their crime enterprise – grew with the roles reversed. Bill, now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator, Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President. They turned this into an exponentially larger business.But it was more than a business, it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise. It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States.The e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same. If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton, you got an entry to the Department of State. Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s.Today a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills. She was Secretary of State Clinton's Chief of Staff. You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business. But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation – no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages.We also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation.This creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise.The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech. I walked through two of them yesterday – the sale of U.S. Uranium to Russia, and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech.The UBS saga is another one. Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans.She negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement. Of the 52,000 accounts the U.S. was seeking, the government settled for only 4,450 accounts. Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual.Before her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60,000 to the Foundation. After the Clinton favor for UBS, it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600,000 contribution, a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton.This is corruption, pure and simple.This is why I have called for a special prosecutor.Justice is supposed to be blind. It's never supposed to be for sale.In the long-run, there is only one way to end the corruption in our country: elect Donald J. Trump.Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.You will be voting for justice, fairness and equality.You will also be voting for a more inclusive country, where no one is left out.Another 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama. The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent.Our pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation. I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty.We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.The era of division is coming to end. We will create a new future of American unity.Are you ready for real American change?It is time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans.We will promote our common culture, values and principles.We will be one nation.We will be one people.We will share together one great future.It's going to be America First.Together, we will make America proud again.We will make America prosperous again.We will make America safe again.Friends, citizens and fellow Americans: We will make America great again.","UCSB"
"100",2016-08-30,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the XFinity Arena in Everett, Washington","Thank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Washington.Together, we are going to work hard over the next 70 days and we are going to win this state – and we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a victory for the people. A victory for the everyday citizen whose voice hasn't been heard.It will be a win for the voters – not the pundits, not the journalists, not the lobbyists, not the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign.This is going to be YOUR victory.We are going to create the New American Future our children deserve.In this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the workforce.Crumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves.Families trapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity.Government will become lean, effective, responsible – and honest.Our border will be protected, and our children will be safe.We will rebuild our inner cities, and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens.American values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once again.But to achieve this future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past – and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies.One area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for African-American citizens in the United States.Millions of African-Americans in this country have succeeded greatly, and their contributions to every area of our life – now and throughout our history – should be celebrated and cherished. This includes the amazing achievements in art, science, sport, music, medicine, business and so much else. This includes millions of African-American entrepreneurs, innovators and the millions of African-American workers in our middle class.But we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities – and neighborhoods afflicted by poverty, drugs, and violence.No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans.There is no better evidence of this fact than Hillary Clinton's immigration policy, which brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from hardworking African-American and Hispanic citizens.Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and provide jobs to struggling Americans.Tonight, I am asking for the vote of every African-American and Hispanic citizen in this country who wants a better future.The inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic Party for fifty, sixty, seventy years.These Democratic policies – the policies of Hillary Clinton – have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, broken homes, and rising crime.Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working. Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since 2009.In Detroit, half of all its residents do not work. In Milwaukee, almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the ages of 24-54 do not have a job.Here, in the state of Washington, 65% of Latino children and 60% of African-American children live in low-income households.Chicago just had the most violent month in 20 years. More than 2,800 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.It breaks our hearts.We cannot let this violence continue. It must be ended.Under A Trump Administration, it will be ended.It will be my priority to work with communities, local police, state police and federal law enforcement to dismantle the gangs and to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and fear. I will appoint the best judges and prosecutors and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission.There is one thing which can no longer be denied: if you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results. To those suffering, I say: what do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump? I will fix it. I will fight for you as no one ever has before.Let me also tell you what you have to gain: jobs, opportunity, security, and safety.This means so much to me.I believe every child in this country – in Detroit, in Baltimore, in Chicago – has the right to live out their lives in safety and peace.In the Wall Street Journal, Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime in our inner cities, and the responsibility of Democratic politicians for creating this problem.The article is called: ""Black Lives Matter to Donald Trump."" McDonald writes that ""Mr. Trump's call to restore law and order recognizes the right of inner-city residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of America now takes for granted.""Freedom from violence is one of the great civil rights issues of our time. So too is the issue of school choice.We will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at success.I will not accept a future in which children of any color in this country are not fully included in the American Dream. Our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented, aspiring Americans on the sidelines. We want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and our country.Remember: the Republican Party is the Party of Lincoln, the party of freedom, equality and opportunity. It is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow, the party of oppression.Nothing makes me more honored and proud than to be the nominee of Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party.Our party will fight to bring hope to every forgotten stretch of this country.Once again, we will be One American Nation.One United People.And we will have One Great Future.That great future will be built on these three critical words: jobs, jobs, jobs.This will include a complete revitalization of our manufacturing sector, which has been so badly hurt by Hillary Clinton's policies.We are bringing the jobs back to our country.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, keep out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stand up to China, and fight for every last American job.The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved.That would be a disaster. We won't let it happen.But that's just the beginning of what we are going to do for American workers.On taxes, we are going to provide massive tax relief to all working people, and lower the tax rate on small business from 35% down to 15%. Low and middle-income parents will also be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes.On regulations, I am going to direct every agency and Department Head in my government to identify all needless and job-killing regulations and they will be removed. We will have a temporary moratorium on new regulations to allow our economy to grow and thrive.Economic growth for last quarter has been revised down to 1.1%, a total disaster. Meanwhile, our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.We will further bring back our jobs by unleashing an American energy revolution – lifting restrictions on oil, coal, natural gas and all sources of American energy. This will create millions of jobs and lower the price of energy for all families.We are also going to secure our border to stop the drugs from pouring in. The Seattle-area recently experienced the largest number of heroin-related deaths in 20 years. We have to stop the drugs poisoning our communities.Another major issue in this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another – beginning with her support for going to war in Iraq in the first place, which I opposed.Her tenure as Secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in U.S. history.Look at the world before and after she became Secretary of State.Pre-Hillary, in early 2009, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.Libya was stable.Syria was under control.The group we know today as ISIS was close to being extinguished.Iran was being choked by sanctions.Now, fast-forward to present time.After Hillary, here is what the world looks like:Iraq is in total chaos.Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.ISIS has been unleashed onto the entire world.Iran – the world's top state sponsor of terrorism – has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, and was given a $400 million dollar cash ransom payment.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and terrorism.America deserves a better legacy.All of you deserve a better future. I am the change agent.Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo.While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time. Bill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State – Bill was paid almost $50 million dollars for speeches during her tenure, an increase of 44% over the previous 4 years.Then there was all the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations.It was pay-for-play. Just look at what she did with UBS, or the Russian Uranium, or disaster relief in Haiti, and so many other examples.But the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 emails she deleted.Hillary Clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her work-related emails. But we know that is one more Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she never turned over, and then another 15,000 emails were just discovered a few weeks ago.Now, today, another 30 emails were discovered by the State Department that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over – these were emails about Benghazi.It just never ends with the Clintons.There is only one way to get justice in this rigged system and that is to show up and vote on November 8th – and to vote big.In A Trump Administration, the State Department will work for the country – not for Hillary Clinton's donors.Under Hillary Clinton, it's the powerful protecting the powerful.Politicians defending politicians.Insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.The government will work for citizens once again.The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity.We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common. We will proudly promote our culture as Americans, the best in the world.It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve.This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a thriving economy, and a just society for each and every American.I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.Together, We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless.","UCSB"
"104",2016-09-03,"Donald Trump","Remarks at Great Faith International Ministries in Detroit, Michigan","""Thank you. That's so nice. Thank you.""Well, that's so nice. And, Bishop Jackson, I want to thank you and Dr. Jackson and you have some voice, I have to say. Incredible. And some spirit, some spirit. Talent.""Thank you. Well, I just wrote this the other day knowing I'd be here. And, I mean it from the heart and I'd like to just read it and I think you'll understand it maybe better than I do in certain ways.""For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country. So true. It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the Civil Rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. It's from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character, a deeper concern for mankind, and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together. And we're bound together and I see that today. This has been an amazing day for me.""The African-American faith community has been one of God's greatest gifts to America and to its people. There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the Black churches and church-goers. You do right everyday by your community and your families. You raise children in the Light of God; I will always support your church, always. And defend your right to worship . . . so important.""I am here today to listen to your message and I hope that my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought. I can tell you that.""Christian faith is not the past but the present and the future. Make it stronger. And we'll open it up to great, great leaders like Pastor Jackson, Bishop Jackson, Dr. Jackson, and so many others. And so many others actually sitting here. Darrell Scott, who is phenomenal, who has been with me for so long. So long. Omrosea, who is a very nice person and I don't want to say that. Because I'll destroy her image by saying that. She's actually a very, very fine person and pastor. And I want to thank all the folks and there is somebody that's been very special to me, Dr. Ben Carson who's been . . . Stand up, Ben. Come here, come here. Come here, Ben. This is a great man and great guy.""So, as I prepare to campaign all across the nation, and in every community, I will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change. Which will be so good for Detroit and so good for this community because we're going to bring jobs back. I will have a chance . . . Thank you. We're bringing them back. We're taking them from Mexico and everywhere else because they're gone.""I will have a chance to discuss school choice. Its very important. And how to put every American on the ladder of success. A great education, a great job. But today, I just want to let you know that I am here to listen to you and I have been doing that. And we had a fantastic interview with Bishop Jackson. It was really an amazing interview. He is better than the people who do that professionally. I will tell you. It's true. It's true. It's true. He's better.""And I didn't really know what I was getting into. I didn't know. Is this going to be nice? Is this going to be wild? He's a great gentleman and a very smart guy. I just hope you don't lose him to Hollywood. That's the only problem. And especially, and especially Dr. Jackson, she may be gone. Hollywood is calling. Look at all those television cameras back there. Look at all the television cameras. I'm sorry to do that to you, Bishop. Because, it's just one of those things, right?""Our nation is too divided. We talk past each other, not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on. They don't know. They have no clue. I'm here today to learn. So that we can together remedy injustice, in any form. And so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways.""Our political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself. I want to reform that system so that it works for you, everyone in this room. I believe true reform can only come from outside the system. I really mean that. Being a businessman is much different than being a politician because I understand what is happening. And we are going outside the establishment.""Becoming the nominee of the Party of Abraham Lincoln — a lot of people don't realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln was a Republican — has been the greatest honor of my life. It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the Party but more important the future of the country and the community.""I believe that we need a Civil Rights agenda for our time. One that ensures the rights to a great education — so important — and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job. A good paying job and one that you love going to every morning. That can happen. We need to bring our companies back.""It also means the right to have a government that protects our works and fights, really fights for our jobs. I want to help you build and rebuild Detroit. And we can do that especially with people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. I mean that. It's been an amazing experience. It's been an amazing experience. Really.""Nothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential, tremendous potential. I met some people this morning that are incredible people and they're looking for jobs. These are incredible people . . . young people. Our whole country loses out when we're unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folks""We're one nation and when anyone hurts, we all hurt together. That is so true. So true.""We're all brothers and sisters and we're all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we are in this all together. All together.""I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right and they will be right. I want America prosperous for everyone. I want to make this city the economic envy of the world and we can do that. We can do that again.""Factories everywhere, new roads and bridges, new schools — especially schools — and new hope.""I have been so greatly blessed, and in so many ways, with no greater blessing than my family. I've had a great family.""Nothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what I have learned in business and in traveling all over the world — I've sort of seen a lot — to bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before. And that's many, many people in Detroit.""When I see wages falling, people out of work, I know the hardships this inflicts and I am determined to do something about it. I will do something about it. I do get things done, I will tell you. Some people have strengths, that's one of my strengths, I get things done. I'm going to get things done for you.""Please know this, for any who are hurting, things are going to turn around.Tomorrow will be better. Much better. The Pastor and I were talking about, riding up the street, how we see all those closed stores and people sitting down on the sidewalk, and no jobs, and no activity. We'll get it turned around. We'll get it turned around, Pastor. Believe me.""We're going to win again as a country and we're going to win again for all of our people. I want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens and the bonds of faith that make our nation strong. America has been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith and through people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. So important. People have no idea how important they are.""Now, in these hard times for our country, let us turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation. I am so deeply grateful to be here today and it is my prayer that the America of tomorrow — and I mean that — that the America oftomorrow will be one of unity, togetherness, and peace. And perhaps we can add the word prosperity. Ok? Prosperity.""I'd like to conclude with a passage from 1 John, Chapter 4. You know it? See, most groups I speak to don't know that. But we know it. If you want, we can say it together: 'No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and His love is made complete in us.' And that is so true.""Thank you very much. This has been such an honor. Thank you very much. Bishop, thank you sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.""","UCSB"
"105",2016-09-06,"Donald Trump","Remarks at a Rally at the Greenville Convention Center in Greenville, North Carolina","Thank you. It's great to be back in North Carolina.In 62 days, we are going to win this state – and we are going to win the White House.This is our chance to end years of injustice, corruption and betrayal.This is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many years.For how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests?This is the year we can finally fix it.That's because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt system.We will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.We will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems.So to every American who has been waiting for real change, your wait is over – your moment of liberation is at hand. A vote for Trump is a vote to restore Democracy, to heal our economy, and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country.The change will begin my first day in office.First, we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land.Then, we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border. This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs, as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth.But that's just the beginning.I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Under Senate rules, that bill can be passed with 51 votes – meaning a Republican Congress and a Republican President can save Americans from this disaster in a single afternoon.It's going to be a very busy first day.I am going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region. My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. She is running to be America's Angela Merkel.I am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so. This is the measure that is called for under current law, and I will enforce it.The Secretary of State is required to take this action, but Hillary Clinton refused to do so – resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into U.S. communities.Furthermore, I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going to be removed – this will include lifting the restrictions on American energy.I will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal, and will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified. We are going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina.Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the TPP. She just does whatever her donors tell her to do.In a Trump Administration, we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers – not on behalf of global corporations.We will work to ensure farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets – and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put America First.Crucially, I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: they will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS. Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission.For years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C. The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia are the same people who are advising Hillary Clinton.I am proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals, active duty military officers, and top military experts who know how to win – and know how to keep us out of endless war.Today, 88 retired U.S. generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsement.That's one of the biggest differences between me and Hillary Clinton. She favors what has been called military adventurism – rushing to invade countries, displacing millions of families, then inviting the refugees into our country – creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like ISIS.I believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability – instead of using our military to create Democracies in countries with no Democratic history.We will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism.We will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton – her legacy of failure in the Middle East, Russia and Asia has made Americans less safe than ever before.As part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts, we are going to rebuild our depleted military. This is the ultimate deterrent.We will be guided by those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.I will ask Congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately re-invest in our military. Right now, we have the smallest air force since 1947, the smallest army since 1939, and one of the smallest Navy's since 1917.Like the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cyber-security.We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential.The new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office. If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn't even get a security clearance.Her conduct is disqualifying.Let's run through what we discovered in those FBI documents. It's important, and we're hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night at the Townhall.It's clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information. She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the FBI she didn't understand that the letter ""C"" meant confidential in the documents she emailed.On 39 separate occasions she said she couldn't recall details about her mishandling of classified information, and she couldn't even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldn't get into her server. Keep in mind, that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program.It's also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered-up their actions. After her private server was revealed last March, her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery, called BleachBit.They used hammers to destroy phones so they couldn't be turned over later – and by the way, who uses 12 different phones in 4 years? The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very shady activity.People who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide don't bleach their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law.Hillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents, then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief-of-staff declare herself to be Hillary Clinton's private attorney.Hillary and her top aides told the FBI and others in related lawsuits that they couldn't recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times – and that's in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5th.No one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimes.Hillary Clinton was using the State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donors.It's called pay-for-play.One example of pay-for-play is what the Clinton's did in Haiti. Let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country. We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake.But while Haiti has suffered, the Clintons and their pals have cashed in.Bill and Hillary's brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti, and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company.Clinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments.In one deal, Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in Haiti.The facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft.People are asking: where did all the money go?This November, it is up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they have raided so many other people and places.One of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clinton's policies are African-Americans. She sees them only as votes, not as people worthy of a better future.Many African-Americans have succeeded so greatly in this country, we will honor and protect their achievements. That includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percent.But millions of African-Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty, joblessness and failing schools.The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.4 in 10 African-American children in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.58% of African-American youth are not working.2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Nationwide, African-Americans are nearly 60% of the murder victims under the age of 22.This is a national crisis – and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the Presidency of the United States.To those suffering in crime and poverty, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. What do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change? We are going to bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, and give parents and students school choice. I will never, ever, ever take you for granted.We are going to push a new Civil Rights agenda. We believe every American has the right to a safe community, a great education and government that protects their jobs.This weekend, I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the Great Faith Ministries International with the amazing Bishop Wayne Jackson. It was an incredible and deeply moving experience.I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Let me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 4: ""No one has ever seen God; but, if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.""Imagine what we our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans – and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.We will keep our children safe – which requires secure borders, a strong military, and supporting law enforcement.Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Government corruption will end – and the State Department will answer to the voters, not Hillary Clinton's donors.Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!","UCSB"
"108",2016-09-09,"Donald Trump","Remarks to the 11th Annual Values Voter Summit in Washington, DC Omni Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D.C.","Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, Jon. Jon is such a great actor and such a great person. He is such a great person. And he's really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways. He's been incredible. So I just want to thank Jon. And I hope he makes another movie very quickly, because I love his movies. [laughter] In particular, I wanted to thank our host, Tony Perkins, for his years of leadership. [applause] And we know all about that. And we all express our support for Tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in Louisiana, where two weeks ago I spent some time, and I saw some incredible, incredible people.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!MR. TRUMP: Thank you. [applause] Amazing, amazing group.One of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time I've spent with the evangelical community. And the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible, I have to tell you. [applause] All across the nation. A lot of people said: I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals. I got the evangelicals. [cheers and applause] I'm going to make it up to you too, you watch. There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States. [applause] True. So true. I've witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land, gotten to know so many people. I saw it during my trip to Louisiana, where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need. Franklin Graham is an example. He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana. [cheers and applause] And he didn't want anything for it. He's a great man. It's that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country, which is in serious, serious trouble. [cheers and applause] Yet, our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith. And you understand that. All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in today's media environment.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right!MR. TRUMP: It is right, isn't it? [laughter] Yeah, it is right. [applause] Not even close. Your values of love, charity and faith built this nation. [cheers and applause] So how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly? One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you, to a large extent. And Hillary Clinton, you can forget about her. [laughter and jeers]So let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like you've never seen before. [cheers and applause] Believe me. I believe it. And you believe it. And you know it. You know it. And that includes religious liberty – remember, remember. [cheers and applause] I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit, Great Faith Ministries International. Stand up if you're member. That's good. That was a great – that was an amazing experience. [applause] And the bishop, what a great guy. In my remarks, I spoke about how African American church – and this is all across the country – for centuries have been the conscience of our nation. Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history, leading us all to a better future. Very true. Amazing. This was such an amazing experience. [applause] This is the power of faith. It's the power to heal. It's the power to unite. It's the power to make all of us live better lives – all of us. [cheers and applause]Our nation today is divided. Nobody likes to say it, but we're living in a very, very divided nation. It will be our faith in God and his teachings, in each other, that will lead us back to unity. [cheers and applause]Each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together, united in common purpose and in common values. So let's talk today about some of the things – and these are great things – that we can do together to create the American future for everybody, not just a certain group of people, but for everybody.The first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back. It's been taken away. [cheers and applause] The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits. If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status.All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings – [cheers and applause] – on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson amendment – [cheers and applause] – if I am elected your president, I promise. [cheers and applause] So important.Thank you. That's so important.And I must tell you from the heart, this started, a building of mine in Manhattan. I had 50 pastors in a big conference room. And we actually had 50 pastors, two rabbis, a couple of priests. We were all talking. And we were there for two hours. And at the end, it was a love-fest. We all agreed. It was like a love-fest.And I said to them – we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue – and I said to them I'd love your support. And I know when I can get support. I'm quite sophisticated. [laughter] And I know they wanted to give me their total support, 100 percent, just like I had in the primaries. And I said I really would like your support. And they didn't really know what I was talking about. And I said, what's going on here? They said, well, sir, we can't do that because we would be violating the laws. And I said, what's the punishment? Well, we could lose our tax-exempt status, which, of course, is a, you know, massive penalty.I said, tell me about this. And we sat down. They talked about it. When did it happen? 1954 or so. Lyndon Johnson was having problems – powerful guy. I actually, as just own way – you have to gain respect for what he was able to do. Can you imagine that this man single-handedly – he was having problems with churches. And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time, maybe for very good reason. And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking, under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status.So we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk. And I said, so, folks, what you're telling me is those people walking way, way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do, because they're allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty. And one of the pastors, who I knew very well – and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just – and magnificent hearts, much more importantly – they looked at me and they said, that's actually right. They have more power than we do. We're not allowed to express.And that's what I said. We have to start thinking about this. And I thought about it. And then we had a large group of pastors again. I said I have thought about it. If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment. We are going to do that. And it's not going to be hard. It's not going to be hard. [cheers and applause]When you – when you think, from the standpoint of political, you have more than men – let's say men are 50 percent, women are 50 percent. You're much more than 50 percent, added together. And I actually believe that's one of the reasons why you haven't seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship – like our polls have been going in the last four weeks, a rocket ship, right? [cheers and applause] I really believe that, because you're great people. The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week, they've been stopped from talking and speaking by a law. And we're going to get rid of that law and it's going to get rid of – we're going to get rid of it so fast.And I'm so proud to say – honestly, I don't want to take credit, but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second. I am so proud – I was just telling this to Tony – to say that was my idea. I figure it's the only way I'm getting to heaven, so this is going to be very – [laughter] – the only way. [applause] So we're going to get rid of it, and we're going to let your great people speak, and you're going to see something happen that's going to be very, very good, OK? So important.I hope – which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th. You cannot – you didn't vote four years ago. You didn't vote.AUDIENCE MEMBER: I did.MR. TRUMP: You did? Well, you did. A few of you did. [laughter] Believe me, I know. I look at the stats. You didn't vote. But this time you really have – and this is your last chance. This is it. I mean, we'll never have this opportunity again. So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up – your family and your friends, and get out and vote, OK? November 8th. [cheers and applause] Thank you. [cheers and applause] And if you do, we're going to win by a lot. That's not going to even be a close election. And if you don't, could be a very unhappy November 8th.We're also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – [cheers and applause] – which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens. And the numbers are horrendous. Your premiums are going up by 50, 60, 70 percent. The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period – very, very long. It is a disaster. It's a disaster, and everybody knows it. And it's going to die of its own weight anyway, but we're going to get rid of it and we're going to replace it with some great, great alternatives – much better health care at a much lower price. [cheers and applause]Hillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care, which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America. That's what she wants. That's what she's aiming at. That's what Obama wanted. He didn't quite get there, but he got this, and you see how bad this has been.One of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice. [cheers and applause] And I can't possibly emphasize this enough. Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools. This education crisis afflicts all communities, but none more so than the African-American community – none. The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50, 60, 70 years, some cases over a hundred years – over a hundred years. Their policies and their politics, and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton, have produced only poverty, joblessness, and rising crime.When she was running for the Senate in New York State, she said she was going to produce jobs, jobs, jobs in Upstate New York. It's a disaster. She's going to produce jobs, big thing – jobs, we're going to bring back jobs. Been a catastrophe. We've lost tens of thousands of jobs. She never did a thing. It was all talk, no action, just like what she's doing right now is all talk, no action. She'll talk and talk, and nothing will happen. Only bad will happen. But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York. She won because of them, and she produced absolutely nothing. Jobs left. It's today one of the worst, one of the most depressing places in this country. So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs. I know jobs. She doesn't know jobs. That I can tell you. [cheers and applause]I have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time – the right to a safe community, a great education and a secure job. [applause]And I say to African-American parents, I say to Hispanic American parents – and I say it with great respect – our inner cities are a disaster – crime, no jobs, education is the worst, in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad. I say, with great respect, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. It can't get any worse. You choose Donald Trump, I'm going to fix the problem. You're going to have safety. [applause] You're going to have good education. We're going to get jobs, because we're going to bring our jobs back. Mexico's taking our jobs. So many other places, they're taking our jobs. What China's doing to us is horrible. We're going to have jobs. What do you have to lose? I'm going to fix this. I'm going to fix it. [cheers and applause]School choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda, and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice. Competition – the schools the schools will get better and better and better. [cheers and applause]And that means a private school, a religious school, a charter school or a magnet school. School choice also means that parents can home-school their children. [cheers and applause] Hundred percent.Hillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally, totally, like a puppet, by special interests. Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools, leading to higher unemployment and more poverty. The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe, nobody will believe.My plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children – [applause] – including every African-American and Hispanic child in this country, every single one of them. [cheers and applause] This proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs. [applause] However – that's good, right? [applause] However, because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level, I will campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs. [applause] If we do this, that would mean $12,000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America. What a difference this is going to make. The money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family. In so many ways, you're going to have choice. My administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city – anybody – anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program – and there will be a lot of them – to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 in funds available per student. As your president, I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice you've ever seen. [cheers and applause] This means a lot to me, because I know it can turn things around. Again, the education can't get worse. Commo Core – we're going to end it. [cheers and applause] We're bringing education local. I will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures. The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again, and I'm going to bring back jobs, and I'm going to bring back the great education. Don't be surprised – remember this, November 8th – don't be surprised, because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks, if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago. You see what's going on? [cheers and applause] They're starting – people are starting to hear about this. And they're saying, wow. Wow. They're liking it. And again, can't get any worse. It's going to get a lot better. But only if I do it. They can't do it. The Democrats, they have – what they've done is incredible. And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same – rigid. It'll never change. Remember, a hundred years, 70 years, 50 – it's not going to change. Not going to happen. Now, let's talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come, the United States Supreme Court. [cheers and applause] Earlier this year, we lost the great justice, Antonin Scalia. The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others. It could even be – I mean, we could end up with a total of five judges by one president. It would be record-setting. Probably be three. Could be four. Could even be five. And you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster. One of the most important issues, frankly – other than maybe defense, because we're going to build up our military, it's so depleted. [cheers and applause] We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to protect your Second Amendment, so many things. But one of the most important – some people think it's actually the most important – is the filling of the seats, United States Supreme Court. You see what's happening right now? Essentially it's four and four. And you see what – how bad it is. We're going to pick great judges. I've already put a list of 11 Federalist Society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews on these 11 people. And we are going to put truly great people. Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what we're looking for, OK? [cheers and applause]This will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic, frankly. That's what's going to happen. I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written. [cheers and applause] We reject judges who rewrite the Constitution to impose their own person views on 300 million-plus Americans. We're not going to have that. I've made public a list of judges, as I said, that will guide my selection process. Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list. And we brought it up. Let's see a list. You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well. [laughter] Because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public. They'd be rejected. Clinton's judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care, the American economy, and Americans religious liberty – not to mention your Second Amendment, which is on very thin ice right now, as you know, because of the fact that we're at four-and-four. If they even pick one judge who's wrong you can probably – as you know it – you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye. And we don't want to see that.Another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security. Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test – its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state. [cheers and applause] Failed at everything. Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons, and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power. They were dying three years ago. The sanctions were choking them. They would have fallen. But Obama didn't support people that would have taken over, and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support.But you look at what's happened to Iran in such a short period of time. But remember the ransom payments. Remember, it was $400 million two weeks ago. But then they made a mistake. This is cash. Remember, they said they paid cash because they couldn't open a bank account. There was no way of sending it into a checking account. [laughter] All lies, just like Obamacare was a big lie, remember? You can use your plan. You can use your doctors – 27 times, right? Twenty-seven times. You can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out to be a lie. It's all a lie. It's all a big lie. It's a rigged system and it's a lie.And I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. The 400 million (dollars), for those that haven't been reading the papers over the last two days, turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash – cash. And I actually said – they said, oh, that money's going to be used for terror. I said, no, they don't need it for terror. They've got 150 billion (dollars). That's in addition to the $150 billion that we're giving back. I said they don't need it. This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts. They're not going to use it for terror. They have plenty of money for terror.Think of it – $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash – massive, big vats of cash. You saw them – cartons. I never saw anything like it. I've seen a lot of cash. [laughter] Hey, never saw anything like this – $1.7 billion (dollars). Can you imagine these guys? Planes get – they stop. Remember, they wouldn't give back the hostages. They waited there for hours and hours. And Obama kept saying, no, no, this has nothing to do – even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in, not to take them back, because they were waiting for something. It was this – just another lie.But can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash? Ai, yai, yai. They think we're stupid. [laughter] They think we're stupid. They won't be thinking it for long. [cheers and applause] Very sad. [cheers and applause]At the same time, ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross. ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East. We cannot let this evil continue – can 't let it. [cheers and applause] ISIS must be destroyed – have to; have no choice.To defeat ISIS, we must use military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare. It's a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago – different world.We must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism – [cheers and applause] – words that our president won't use and words that Hillary Clinton won't use. Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy, so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism.By the way, President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more. But it's almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria. They take others, but they don't take Christians – very, very, very rare.So I said that we need to make safe zones in the region. We want to take care of people. But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue, and we have to stop this. This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country. It's from within. This could be the all-time great Trojan horse. This could be it.You ever notice on the – you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones. Cellphones. And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them. And some of them have things far worse than that – scenes far worse than that.So it was the failed policies, you have to remember, of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place. If they did the right thing, you wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now. [applause] Now she wants to get rid of – oh, we're going to get rid of them. You know, she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground. Now, even if you don't want boots on the ground, you don't want to say it. Don't say it! Now they're saying, oh, I hope she wins. Oh, boy, would they dream of having her as president. Can you – [laughter] – they dream about it every night, having Hillary Clinton. But even if you believe – and I can understand that. No boots on the ground, I can understand. You don't say it! Let them think they're going to go through hell. Don't say it! [cheers and applause]Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur, can you imagine the great General George Patton, or one of our great generals that we have today – General Flynn, who's here someplace – [cheers and applause] – I love General Flynn – but can you imagine these people saying – I mean, they're basically giving out the strategy: there will be no boots on the ground. If you don't want that, I fully understand. Don't say it! Don't say it! Could you imagine MacArthur saying we're going to fight the enemy, and we're going to move our troops in in about a month, we're going to hit from behind? [laughter] We're going to hit them from the front, then – and everything they say turns out to be true? You know, I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room, but maybe we shouldn't be so honest when it comes to military strategy. Does that make sense? [laughter and applause] Hope I didn't lose your vote for saying that. [applause]Just look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq, Syria and Libya. The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She really is. She's trigger-happy, and yet she says no boots, which is sort of – probably will be boots, you know. Probably will turn out to be another disaster. He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death. She's just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change with people we don't even know who they are. And they take over, and they're far worse. This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS.My administration, on the other hand, will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And by the way, that includes Russia. If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I'm concerned. [cheers and applause] It's a very imperfect world, and you can't always choose your friends. That's life.But you can never fail to recognize your enemies. We have some real enemies. Unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails. These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena. What's that? Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never, ever see them. She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them, and many were destroyed with a hammer. [laughter] Did anybody ever hit a hammer – you know, maybe two or three people, but they were just released from prison, those two people. [laughter] Can you believe this? Destroyed them with a hammer – the old-fashioned way, I guess. [laughter] The other night in the Commander in Chief Forum – did anybody see that? [cheers and applause] How did I do? [cheers] Good. Well, we have a big debate coming up. Who knows what's going to happen there? But I will say, every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief. [cheers and applause] We had – the polls came out after that event and we won big league. Now we have a debate coming up. I don't imagine any of you going to be watching the debate, right? [laughter and cheers]AUDIENCE MEMBER: Don't take her bait. Don't take her bait.MR. TRUMP: I won't; I promise. Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly. That's why she lost. That's why she did so poorly. She was terrible. She was – honestly, I shouldn't be saying this – she was terrible. [laughter] She keeps talking about the emails. Every time she talks about them, she talks about them differently. [laughter] It seems each week, true, she has, like, a different answer. But there can be no answer when she deletes 33,000 emails, bleaches them so they can never be recovered – an unheard-of practice – hammers them into total silence. You know what happening. You know what's happening.I always say, getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career. [laughter and cheers] It's true. It's true. [cheers and applause] So her answers were bad. They were bad. And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest. And you know, she was blaming Matt Lauer. I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job. I mean, his questions to me were very tough. [applause] But the gentleman who stood up and said: Honestly, you should be in prison for what you did – [jeers] – to me, that was the tough one. [laughter] That was the tough – hey, that was a tough question. [laughter] It was sort of a question in the form of a statement, right? [laughter]Hillary Clinton is unfit to be our president, for many reasons. [cheers and applause] True. True. [cheers and applause] She's unfit for many reasons, the biggest of which is her judgement. It's just so bad. [laughter] It's time to restore honestly and integrity to our government. [applause] Have to do it. And one more issue, finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy, and helping those in need. There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians. [applause] And all of us through – and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering Americans out of poverty. Going to do it, with a lot of other people going to help. As you president, I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country – millions of new jobs. [cheers and applause] We've lost our jobs like we're a bunch of babies. They've gone to other countries. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to many other countries. China's taking massive advantage of us. It's all so easy, believe me. It's all so easy.That includes, we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses. [cheers and applause] It includes, very importantly, the elimination of all needless job-killing regulations. [cheers and applause] It includes lifting the restrictions on American energy, which is under siege. [cheers and applause] I will also renegotiate NAFTA. And if they don't want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway, not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs, we will terminate NAFTA, believe me. [cheers and applause] We'll stand up to China, and we're going to fight for every last job. It's going to be America first, and it's going to be the American worker first. [cheers and applause]Crucially, I will also fight for the American family and American family values. The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda. Has to be. [cheers and applause] Thank you.Our country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly. Great woman, really great woman. [applause] We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones. I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis. [cheers and applause]Phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America. She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we can't simply turn to government or to politicians. The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God. Phyllis understood that. [cheers and applause] Phyllis understood that.And by the way, Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago, when it wasn't necessarily – [cheers] – something that was so easy to do. And she was incredible. She was so brave. She endorsed me, and that was not the thing to do at the time. People said, Trump? She said, he's going to win, you don't understand. He knows how to win. He's going to win. [applause] They said, Phyllis, not going to be Trump. And we went boom, boom, boom. But I will tell you, Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasn't necessarily the thing to do, even the popular thing to do, and I will never forget that. That had a huge impact. She was a great, great, powerful woman with a tremendous heart. And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow, because you really – that's a celebration. She was 92 years old. [cheers and applause]We are all equal, and we all come from the same Creator. If we remember that simple fact, then our future is truly limitless. There is nothing we as Americans can't do.There's a biblical verse that I have often read, and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what we're trying to achieve right now for our country. It's from 1 John, Chapter 4: ""No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us.""AUDIENCE MEMBER: Amen.MR. TRUMP: So true. [cheers and applause] So true. [applause]Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag. [cheers and applause] It's time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country.This is my promise to all of you: starting in 2017, we will be one American nation. It's time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future. Have to do it. Together, we will make America believe again, we will make America united again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, and God bless you. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]","UCSB"
"109",2016-09-09,"Donald Trump","Remarks at a Rally at the Pensacola Bay Center in Pensacola, Florida","It is so great to be back in Florida, my second home. Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today. We've worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans.Let me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November.Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin.The citizens of this country will be in charge once more.The special interests have had their day. That chapter in our history is closing.The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.This will be your time. You will be running the show. Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.All we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible.Change is coming.All the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.It's your turn now. This is your time.The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change – not partisan change.We are fighting for all Americans – Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals – who've been failed by this corrupt system. We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.We're also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida, and every part of America. From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country.Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the past.Ours is the campaign of the future.In this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first – and that keep jobs in our country. All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership – are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton.Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America. The era of economic surrender is over.We will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it.In this new future, we are going to raise your wages. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000.My tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up. Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense. Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years.The people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton – much of it to her personal bank account – to keep you from having the future you deserve.But on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want.In this future, we are going to pursue new education policies. At the center of my plan is school choice. I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family.In this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career.To keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength.That means rebuilding our badly depleted military. I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops.We are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.One more massive Hillary Clinton failure.Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder.She handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too – without any plan for the day after.She failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.And of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia –while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.Let's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch.Unlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength – not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.That is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world – so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.If I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing.I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn.America will get the respect it deserves.And if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before. And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back -- but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people.On these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace – for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future.Hillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world.Her policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change – but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States.Her only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal. She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress.She lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities.By the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide.And we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding. She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.Hillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment.I just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world. If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening.Throughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth. Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale.My Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure. Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.The insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.All the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East.I am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win – and how to avoid endless war.Let me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country.There is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people.It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory.We will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States – not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly.And we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism.The fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country. This is one single fact she can never escape.Any country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission.We will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years.We simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now.That applies to everything.Change is needed at every single level of our society.When I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American.I want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had.The possibilities for our future are unlimited.The Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired.If we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything.That also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons. They want to scare you out of voting for change. The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist – now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase. It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.When I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone – but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind.We are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people.New schools, new factories, new infrastructure.Beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation. We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing.Most importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty.Here, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans – from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over.These incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures.To all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion.All working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump.In particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers.I've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers. I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine.My campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back.This is our chance. It's our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again.Gleaming new plants stretching across our nation.Young Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice – and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition.Our Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world. You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com.Massive tax reductions and tax simplification – so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money. Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time.Most importantly, 2017 will be about unity.Once again, we will be One American Nation.We Will Be One American People.Just imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans.We will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.Friends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again!","UCSB"
"110",2016-09-12,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the US Cellular Center in Asheville, North Carolina","This is our chance – our one chance – to fix our rigged system and create prosperity for each and every American.Our vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent's campaign of hate.Hillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions, and no new ideas.By contrast, I've been going around the country offering detailed plans for reform.All of these reform plans are available on our website.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.You are mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders. You are Democrats, Independents and Republicans.Above all else, you are Americans – and you are entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you and defends you.Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country.Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House.Hillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors and the special interests.I will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute, but first let me invite onto the stage some people who can tell you themselves what they think of her spiteful comments.I have some more thoughts on Clinton's remarks I will be sharing momentarily, but first I want to tell you what I am going to do to make your life better.We've outlined a detailed plan on trade, on immigration, on rebuilding the military, on changing our foreign policy.I've delivered a plan on defeating Islamic terrorism, on reforming our tax code, on unleashing American energy, and on providing school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.We've released policy after policy, solution after solution.Every day, we are putting forward new ideas to make your life better.The change will start right away, the moment I take my oath of office.On my first day, we are going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama.Then, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restriction on American energy – this will create another half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.On my first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.I am also going to propose a massive tax reduction to unleash prosperity in every city and state in our country.On that first day, I am also going to instruct the Department of Commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt American manufacturing. I will use every lawful Presidential power to achieve relief for our workers.You can read the full 7-point trade plan on my website, DonaldJTrump.com.North Carolina has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed it, and Hillary Clinton supported it.Right here in Ashville, you've lost 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization – another Hillary-backed deal.Hillary Clinton owes all of you an apology. And I think you'll get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton hands over the 33,000 emails she deleted.By the way, Hillary Clinton destroyed her emails after she received a congressional subpoena. They used a special software called bleach bit.She even made her 13 different phones disappear – some of them were even destroyed with a hammer.Hillary Clinton obviously had a whole lot to hide, including her pay-for-play scandals at Secretary of State.Pay-for-play with UBS, with Russian Uranium, with contracts for her friends and family in Haiti.Nothing is so dangerous to American Democracy as when a public official puts their federal office up for sale.Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law.She also believes that she is above all of you.After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country.She said tens of millions of patriotic Americans belong in a ""basket of deplorables."" She talks about people like they're objects, not human beings.She said half of our supporters are not even real Americans, and describes the other half as having run out of options – what she can't understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through the lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment. They want change, they want justice, and they want a government that puts the American people first.Whether our supporters have lost a job to a factory moved to another country, or whether they're a captain in the police department, or a teacher at a local school, they are united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people.For those who have been hit by hard times, they understand better than anyone that it's Hillary Clinton's Wall Street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country.Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these working class Americans. She looks down on them – she looks down on all the people who make her life possible. She looks down on the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, lawyers and accountants. She looks down on the police officers, soldiers, and firefighters supporting our campaign.She looks down on the people who cook her meals, drive her cars, and dig the coal that powers her electricity.She called these Americans every name in the book – racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic – she said they were not even American.Never in history has a major-party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter.She was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all Americans.What should these parents tell their children about Hillary Clinton's attacks?To every kid in America tonight, I want you to know: your parents are working so hard to make your life better, and to make your country better – and if I get the chance, I will fight right alongside them to deliver a better future for everyone.Clinton made her remarks at a high-dollar fundraiser in Wall Street. Her goal is simple: to bully the American voter out of voting for change.The people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are. They want to keep our terrible trade deals. They want to trap children in failing government schools. They want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete.Hillary Clinton can never be President of this country. No one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their President.Earlier today I had a chance to spend some time with some more of our most amazing Americans.I spent the afternoon with the National Guard Association of the United States.These are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters, and who fight our wars.These heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation.We also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.There is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and its people.Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting.One thing that we must do is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment, resources and tools in the world.We must provide them the best medical care while they serve, and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life.The Veterans scandals that have occurred under this Administration – and that have been dismissed by my opponent – are a permanent stain on this government. It's just one more way Hillary Clinton only looks out for herself.We must take care of our Veterans. That includes giving Veterans the right to choose treatment at either a public VA facility, or the private doctor of their choice.Just today we learned that the VA has violated a federal law by failing to make its performance records available to consumers.The scandals never seem to end – but they will, when I'm elected President.Nothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who hear the uniform.We've received endorsements from 120 generals and admirals, these are the people who know how to keep our country safe.Just today, I was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of 13 Medal of Honor recipients. I can't even begin to say how much it means to me to have the support of these intrepid heroes.Also, today, I was thrilled to announce that Ambassador R. James Woolsey, former head of the CIA, is now a senior advisor to our campaign.We are on a mission of change.That includes a new agenda for our inner cities.The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.For those suffering and hurting, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. I will fix it. What do you have to lose?Let me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of new jobs, higher wages, and amazing schools.I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans – and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.We will keep our children safe – which includes steadfast support for American law enforcement.Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Government corruption will end.Honesty will be restored.Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America prosperous again.We will make America safe again.And will Make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless!","UCSB"
"113",2016-09-13,"Donald Trump","Remarks at Seven Flags Event Center in Des Moines, Iowa","Thank you. It is so great to be back in Iowa. Spending time in your state has been one of the great joys of this campaign.Together, we are going to win Iowa in November -- and we are going to win the White House, and Make America Great Again.The White House will become the People's House. We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years.We are going to fix our crumbling infrastructure, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, free children from failing government schools, eliminate government waste, and create a fair, simple and efficient tax code that adds millions of new jobs.Prosperity will rise, poverty will recede, and wages will finally begin to grow – and they will grow rapidly.This is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people.In recent days, we've rolled out one new policy idea after another – on taxes, on school choice, on foreign policy, on defeating terrorism, on rebuilding our military, on Veterans care, on unleashing American energy, and on the vital issue of trade.By contrast, Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions, only hatred and derision.I am running to be a President for all Americans – Democrat, Republican, Independent, everyone. Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, the young and the old, and millions of working class families all over this nation.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.It's this attitude of arrogance that explains why Hillary Clinton made her 13 phones disappear – including with a hammer – so the FBI couldn't see them, and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena. Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress today.Anyone watching today's hearing in Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt than we even imagined.This is a far bigger scandal than Watergate ever was, but with Watergate we had the Justice Department doing its jobs – here we don't have either. This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar pay-for-play scheme between the Secretary of State and her Foundation.Whether it's her emails, her disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria, or her failures on the economy, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, temperament and moral character to lead this country.In the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office: ""she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.""The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced death and destruction overseas, and produced only failing schools, rising crime, job loss, shrinking incomes, and tragic poverty at home.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled to nearly $20 trillion during the Obama Years.I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.That includes our family farms right here in Iowa.Family farms are the backbone of this country. We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms.We are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, corn-based ethanol, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief.Our plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death – helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.That means we are going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers, help them export their goods, and grow family farming in America.My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy – which means lower electricity prices for our farmers, and half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.By the way, remember when Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, said the ""lack of transparency,"" was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about – and I quote – ""the stupidity of the American voter."" This is the hateful attitude of insiders like Mr. Gruber and Hillary Clinton – and the voters have had enough. They're taking their country back.Another major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.It's time to break-up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.Our policies on taxes, trade, regulations and education will grow incomes, boost jobs and reduce poverty for our African-American and Hispanic communities.We need a new civil rights agenda for our time, one that promises safe neighborhoods, great education, and secure jobs.Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.Over 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year. There's a shooting on average every 2 hours.To those suffering and hurting I say: what do you have to lose – vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it. I will bring back millions of jobs, higher wages, and great schools.I will make your communities safe.Safety also means protecting our people from Radical Islamic Terrorism.New video has just been released showing ISIS butchers murdering innocent people in what has been called a Syrian slaughterhouse. The victims were dragged, then hung from meathooks, and then their throats were slit.This is an evil, sadistic, monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country.We know that ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows, and to recruit refugees after their entry to our country.My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. According to the Senate Subcommittee on immigration, her entire plan will bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term and cost $400 billion in lifetime benefits.Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling Americans get jobs.I support the construction of safe zones in the region, and we will get the Gulf States to pay for it.At the same time, as we rebuild our military, we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share. Only 5 of the 28 member NATO countries meet their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense. I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the security burden – and that we are properly focused on Radical Islamic Terrorism.In all things, it's time to put Americans first – and start taking care of each other.Tonight, I am going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment. I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA – which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world a one-way street for jobs out of the United States – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States – not in China, and all over the world.We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again – like never before.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!","UCSB"
"114",2016-09-14,"Donald Trump","Remarks at a Rally at Canton Memorial Civic Center in Canton, Ohio","Thank you, Ohio. It is so great to be in the great city of Canton.We just got new polls from Bloomberg and CNN. We're up five points in Ohio, and the LA Times poll has us up 5 points nationwide.The people of the United States are ready for change. They're ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains, disrespects and looks down on hardworking people.This election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in Washington D.C. versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens.For years, our leaders have looked out only for themselves.There is no greater example of this in our country than Flint, Michigan. The city of Flint was once known as Buick City. More than 80,000 workers were employed by GM in 1970 – today, its less than 8,000. Forty percent of the city's residents are living in poverty. Violent crime is among the nation's highest.Today I went to Flint, Michigan to address the water crisis. The water crisis in Flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government.It's tragic and it's heartbreaking, and it should never happen in the United States of America.This is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own.It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We are going to turn this around. We are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people.Driving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses, the dilapidated infrastructure.This is what our politicians have done to this city, this is what our politicians have done to America.But nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities. Democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for 50, 60, 70 years. Their policies have produced massive poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.They've trapped Americans in suffering for years, and I'm running to offer a better future. Lower crime, better schools, more jobs – safety, security, opportunity.Now, I understand there are going to be some people in these communities who aren't planning on voting for me right now. I will campaign hard for their votes – we can't stay the course our country is on. If you keep voting for the same people, you'll keep getting the same results.I am willing to campaign anywhere. I am willing to go anywhere, visit anywhere, even if some voters openly oppose me in a community I will go there and ask them for their support.Hillary Clinton calls people who aren't supporting her deplorable and irredeemable. I call people who aren't supporting me American citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else – and I will not stop campaigning for every last American vote, in every last American community, right up until November 8th.I will take my message to communities that are 99% Democrat, or that have voted Democrat for generations. I am running to be President for all Americans, to represent all Americans, and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence.The economic policies of Hillary Clinton – on trade, on the economy, on immigration – have devastated the inner cities of America. Her policies are the problem; we are offering the solution.Hillary Clinton believes in globalism – taking jobs from Flint and moving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the world – I am running to be President of the United States. I am running to bring hope to Flint, to Canton, and to every party of this country.If we don't break free from our partisan boxes, then nothing will ever change – it's time to vote for America and America First.Hillary Clinton's refugee plans will cost $400 billion dollars in the long-term. That's enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the United States.President Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions, bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just one single year.Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees, we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of Americans.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. You are cops and soldiers; mechanics and accountants; young and the old; black, white and Latino. You are moms and dads, children and grandparents, you are from cities small and large and in-between. But above everything else, you are all Americans.Hillary Clinton's attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress.There is no greater threat to Democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale. Look at what she did with Russian Uranium, or with UBS bank, or with the contracts in Haiti.Hillary Clinton's record as Secretary of State is one of historic failure. Just look at what she did to the Middle East – in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya. Not to mention her failures in Russia, China and North Korea.One failure after another – all while raising millions and millions from her friends in Wall Street.The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled.I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.That begins with a new America-First trade policy.Hillary Clinton's bad judgement was seen in her support for Bill Clinton's NAFTA, her support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and her support for the TPP – she called it the ""Gold Standard.""Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and 1 in 4 since China entered the WTO.Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.I will renegotiate NAFTA, I will defend your jobs, and I will bring back vehicle production to the United States of America.America's trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved – which Hillary Clinton 100% would do if she ever got the chance.We won't let that happen. But you have to get out and vote.My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.I will fight for you against the special interests, against the corrupt politicians, and against the powerful insiders. Let me be your champion.In all things, it's time to put Americans first – and start taking care of each other.Yesterday, I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans.I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment [NRA endorsement]; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA – which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a one-way street for jobs out of the United States – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States – not in China, and all over the world.We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again – like never before.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. We will rebuild our water infrastructure, and our EPA will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission: clean air and safe water.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!","UCSB"
"115",2016-09-15,"Donald Trump","Remarks to the Economic Club of New York at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City","Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.Today, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival – it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.Right now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It's a silent nation of jobless Americans.Look no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM – today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We are going to turn this around.My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.Jobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.All of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism – which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country – and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.Under this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.My opponent's plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution – a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests.In Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.Not one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.In the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people. Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.In many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.Politicians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.Worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable – how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?The hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos – but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future.These are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don't have a voice.I am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.I'm not running to be President of the world. I'm running to be President of the United States – and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.We are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.It's time to start thinking big once again.That's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth.In working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math.This growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.It will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.Right now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter – that translates to millions of lost jobs.This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.Over the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.Perhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work.Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.On top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt – it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.Now, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.Instead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.Never has so much money been spent so poorly.But we're going to turn that all around. Here's how.It begins with bold new tax reform.As outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all – in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.By lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.In addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit – it won't even be close.This is a working and middle class tax relief proposal.The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka.These proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.Families will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.Parents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit – in the form a Childcare rebate – and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.By contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate – down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch.We will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.On top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.We will turn America into a magnet for new jobs – and that means jobs in our poorest communities.Next, comes regulations.One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.Regulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry – and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.I've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books.This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.We're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.Energy reform is central to our plan as wellAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.Hillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.A Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will:increase GDP by more than $100 billion annuallyadd over 500,000 new jobs annuallyincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 yearsincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decadesincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama – creating countless more jobs in the process.Finally, comes trade – the foundation for everythingAmerica's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year – an enormous drag on growth.Between World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.Predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.It is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted – every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.Our manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.I have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps:I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators – and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.We are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country. We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.We are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Next, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.Just the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.We are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.Here is how the plan adds upWe are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan.Our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.That leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade – again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.If our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.This is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.This is what our new future will look likeI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA – and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!","UCSB"
"116",2016-09-16,"Donald Trump","Remarks at a Rally at the James L. Knight Center in Miami, Florida","Thank you. It is so great to be in my second home, Florida, and in the city of Miami where I have so many wonderful friends and employees.New polls have just come in, and we're leading in battleground states all over this country – including four points here in Florida. LA Times has us up 6 points nationwide.Come November 8th, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a victory for the people – it's going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the Veterans, the everyday citizens.And it's going to be a victory for those who haven't had reason for hope in a long time.I'm campaigning in every community, and every part of this country, for every last vote. I am running to be a President for all Americans.I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti and I'm going to be campaigning hard for their votes. What incredible people.Our support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life. You are cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, black, white and Hispanic – but above all else, you are American.Just today, I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor and many of our amazing military leaders. We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and Admirals.We also have the support of 16,500 Border Patrol Officers – as well as law enforcement officers across the country.And we have the support of millions of patriotic Moms and Dads who go to work every day and make this country run.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and love your country.Clinton's campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists. It's the oldest play in the Democratic play book – and Americans have had enough.They want solutions, and they want better lives – not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians.People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.Yet, while she lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors, she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.It's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world. It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS.Her policies have created disaster overseas, and poverty at home. I am running to reverse these failures, and create a New American future.That future begins with prosperity at home.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities. African-Americans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.Democrats have run these inner cities for half a century. They control the mayors' offices, the school boards, the city councils, and the seats in Congress – and all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime, and more failing schools.45% of African-American children under the age of 6 now live in poverty. More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago this year alone. 58% of African-American youth are not working.These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton, and everyone knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more suffering.Hillary Clinton has been there in Washington for 30 years – her disastrous record speaks for itself.The only people she delivers for is her donors.I am going to deliver for you, the American people.If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.My first day in office, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy – which means at least another half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.I am also going to completely reform our trade deals. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and keep America out of the TPP. We don't need another massive multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down.Another major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty. This is unacceptable. To the Hispanic community I say: we are going to protect your jobs, we are going to build up your schools, and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.Earlier this week, I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.We are also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression.The President's one-sided deal for Cuba benefits only the Castro Regime. But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro Regime were done through executive order, which means the next President can reverse them – and that is what I will do, unless the Castro Regime meets our demands. Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.Let's also talk about Venezuela.Venezuela is a beautiful, vibrant, and resource-rich country, filled with amazing and hardworking people. But Venezuela has been run into the ground by socialists.The next President of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere, and I will stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free.Here, in America, I will push to expand freedom for all of our people.I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!","UCSB"
"118",2016-09-20,"Donald Trump","Remarks at High Point University in High Point, North Carolina","Thank you. It's wonderful to be back in North Carolina.Come November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to bring back your jobs.We are going to cut your taxes.We are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals.And we are going to protect our country from Radical Islamic Terrorism.Over the weekend, there were Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota and New York City, and in New Jersey. These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country.Attack after attack – from 9/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando – we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in danger.So let me state this very clearly: immigration security is national security.My opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency. As Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldn't take them back.Now Obama wants to bring in an additional 110,000 refugees, and Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term – with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.This isn't just a matter of terrorism, but also quality of life. We want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country.My highest duty as President is to protect our citizens and to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day – and I will never waver in that sacred obligation.It's just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering. Since 9/11, hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terrorist-related activity in the United States.Now we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders. This is unacceptable.Altogether, there are nearly 1 million individuals in the United States with deportation orders who have not yet been removed.In the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism.Now we must defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.Yet, my opponent won't even say the words Radical Islamic Terrorism. In fact, Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists. She calls the patriotic Americans who support our campaign – many of them cops and soldiers – deplorable and irredeemable. Has she ever talked that way about Radical Islam, or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas? Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? In many countries overseas, non-believers face the death penalty – where is Hillary's condemnation here?Let's ask Hillary Clinton: how many people who subscribe to Radical Islamic views, and support the oppression of non-believers, would you call deplorable or irredeemable – or are those words reserved only for hardworking Americans that truly love their country and that support Donald Trump?America can never elect a President, like Hillary Clinton, who apparently, with her choice of words, thinks decent American citizens are a bigger threat than Radical Islamic Terrorists.Anyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President.The commander-in-chief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction. Our system of government is the best in the world and, as your President, I will defend our values – and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way.It's also time to remember one very important word: accountability. All this disaster with ISIS happened on Hillary Clinton's watch.Her policies in Iraq, Libya and Syria are responsible for the rise of ISIS. Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us.Her timetable withdrawal from Iraq, her push for regime change in Libya and Syria, her open borders policies – these are the actions that unleashed the ISIS disaster.So she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure.Her claim that my opposition to Radical Islamic Terrorism is a recruiting tool, demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying.When she says my opposition to radical Islamic Terror provides ""aid and comfort,"" to the enemy, we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office. Her comments are not only reckless, but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks.ISIS is torturing, murdering, executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide. And what is Hillary Clinton's suggestion? That we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers. I have news for Hillary Clinton: refusing to call out Radical Islam will not lessen the danger, it will only increase and embolden the danger – just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as Secretary of State.The rise of ISIS is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.Secretary Clinton has helped to topple regimes, displace millions, and then opened the door to ISIS to enter our country. How is this a smart policy?Hillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today – and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores.We must stop the massive inflow of refugees – which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase. We should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur.Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion – such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith– are commonplace.It is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here, and to become part of our incredible home. Hillary Clinton disagrees with this common sense rule, and it's one more reason why she can never be President.It's time to break with the corruption, the bad judgement, and the failures of the past.It is time to have a new American Future.We are going to change our immigration system to reflect American values.We are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas, and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy ISIS and defeat Islamic terrorism. This will not only require military warfare, but also financial warfare, cyber warfare, and ideological warfare.But to win this struggle, we need to be strong at home.We are going to rebuild our country.And at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities.Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year.The schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty.To the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it – I will bring back your jobs, I will fix your schools, and I will fight for you as no one ever has before.It is time for a new civil rights agenda, one that promises safe communities, great education, and good-paying jobs.My whole life has been about creating jobs. Hillary Clinton has spent her career destroying jobs – just look at upstate New York, and her terrible trade deals.Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through.The South Korean deal was supposed to create 70,000 jobs – instead, we lost 100,000 jobs and our trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled.Next, Hillary Clinton wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Your state has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. I am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal – and if we don't get the deal we want, I will walk away.Our trade deficit is now nearly $800 billion a year – this is the economic legacy of Hillary Clinton.But we are going to turn it all around.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to create American energy independence; I'm going to make our government lean, responsible and efficient; I'm going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend American workers; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution of the United States;We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!","UCSB"
"119",2016-09-22,"Donald Trump","Remarks at a Rally at Sun Center Studios in Chester Township, Pennsylvania","Thank you. It's wonderful to be here in Pennsylvania.Great polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.At the center of our society is going to be a simple promise to every American: safety.We are going to Make America Safe Again.The rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens. It must be ended.The main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peace.Who is looking out for them?For every one violent disruptor, there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from school.To all our citizens, in all of our inner cities, and all across the country, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you and I will fight for you.The job of a leader is to stand in someone else's shoes and see things from their perspective. Hillary Clinton calls people who don't support her deplorable, and irredeemable. I call anyone who doesn't support me an American citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the law.I will be a President for all Americans, and I will campaign for every last vote, in every last community.I will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizens.But to do this, we must work with our police – not against our police.Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least.Low-income African-Americans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs, lost property values, and lost lives.65 people have been shot in the city of Chicago alone since Friday.The problem is not that there are too many police. The problem is that there are not enough police.Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from chaos.Hillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night. No, it's the poor family living in the inner city – it's the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country.Who is there to represent these families?Hillary Clinton doesn't want to hear their voices. So I will be their voice, and I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country. People who just want a secure community for their families, good schools for the kids, and a good-paying job to support their loved ones.We will bring security to our African-American communities, and to our Latino communities. We will also bring school choice, and new prosperity.Democrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century. It's time for change – it's time for a New American Future.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.My opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been ""fighting for women."" That she has been ""fighting for children."" Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, ""Watch what I do, not what I say.""At the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents.And just last week here in Pennsylvania, I was joined by my daughter, Ivanka, and I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare.We have also talked about improving education, and I will talk about it more tonight. A first-class public school education, as well as options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling, is a right, not a privilege. The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, should be easier to access, pay for, and finish. Education is the bedrock of our society.Women also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and protect our borders. As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.This must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change.The changes will start immediately.On my first day in office, I am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses.This will unleash a technology revolution. America will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future. The next great American invention, the next great improvement to our lives, is right around the corner. All we have to do is remove the red tape.Our plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in American history. It's going to include a 15% tax rate for all businesses, small and large, making our country a magnet for new jobs.We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution. Oil, coal, natural gas, shale energy, and renewables. This will add at least half a million new jobs every single year.But to be a prosperous nation, we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own country.That is why I will direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors. We will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses.Steel jobs, and all manufacturing jobs, will be returning to Pennsylvania in a very big way.Your state has lost one-third of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and one-fourth of your manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization. These were both Bill Clinton deals backed by Hillary Clinton.The Clintons robbed Pennsylvania, stole your jobs, and shipped them to other countries – we are going to bring them back.Jobs will come flowing back in all over America.It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We're going to turn it all around.There's a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign – and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.My campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you – visit DonaldJTrump.com to find out how you can help our movement.Let me tell you what else we're going to do.One of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education. The cost of college has increased by over 500% since 1973.But what a lot of people don't know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments. These huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don't use the money to help with tuition and student debt.Instead, these universities use the money to pay their administrators, or put donors' names on buildings, or just store the money away. In fact, many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programs.But they should be using the money on the students – for tuition, for student life, and for student housing.On top of that, the federal government spends over $70 billion in higher education every year, plus another $130 billion on federal loans.Here again, the universities don't use the money to reduce the price of college – but to increase it.We have to break this cycle. I'm going to work with Congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars – paid for by you – that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt, and to spend their endowments on their own students.Another major issue for all American families is healthcare. President Obama promised Obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by $2,500 dollars. Instead, the opposite happened – the cost of healthcare has increased nearly $5,000 dollars during that time.Just one more Washington lie – like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.It's a disaster.That is why, on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.We are going to replace government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first. These reforms include expanding access to popular Healthcare Savings Accounts, empowering Americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines, and block granting Medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, wants to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcare.Her plan also gives Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, by making them citizens – bankrupting these programs for Americans.She doesn't understand how Democracy works. Public servants are just that – they're there to serve you. But the only people Hillary Clinton has ever served are the special interests.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America – and America First.Together, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.Government will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity – where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.We turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.That's what I want to do for our country – I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.I've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses – I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be – all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.We are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers – and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.It's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.It's that spirit of strength we will need to start winning again as a country.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. Go to our website to learn more. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.You have 46 days to change the world. You have 46 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution of the United States; close our border to terrorists, save the 2nd amendment; and put American workers first.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!","UCSB"
"120",2016-09-22,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Shale Insight TM Conferencee at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","Good morning. Thank you, Christine, for that kind introduction.I also want to thank the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association for inviting me to join you here today. Your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans.Let me also recognize my friend, Harold Hamm.It is great to be here in Pittsburgh, the Steel City. Under a Trump Administration, we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nation.Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country.Our country desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times – but which has lifted us up, in the past, to our greatest achievements as a nation. Every day, I see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country – and become One American Nation, united by our shared values and principles as American Citizens.We all have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes, see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our wounded country.Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding on their TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities.We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption, or to threaten the public safety and peace.Every single American in this country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end.The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots, are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities. It is their jobs, housing markets, schools and economic conditions that will suffer – and the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety.There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace.For every one violent protestor, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.Last year, we saw a 17% rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago so far this year alone.Nationwide, approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American.This is a national crisis, and it is the job of the next President to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save African-American lives.Look at the example of Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York. The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable.We need a national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again.I will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels, gangs and criminal syndicates – and I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country.My Administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority.Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success: a great education, and a good-paying job. To have the best schools, and the best jobs, you must have safe communities.That means we must recognize the contributions of our police, who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life, and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocent.We all remember, earlier this year, when officers in Dallas – hunted down for execution – continued protecting the public until their last moments on earth.Every day, police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and, every year, many of them will go out on calls and never return.Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from total chaos.They are also the front lines of defense in the War on Terror, as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in New Jersey, and New York, and the off-duty police officer's heroic actions in Minnesota.In addition to providing safety, we must provide economic opportunity. That begins with school choice, and leads to a secure job with a rising income.This brings us to the subject of energy.Producing more American energy is a central part of my plan to Making America Wealthy Again – especially for the poorest Americans.America is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy – some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves.It's all upside: more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices.I am going to lift the restrictions on American energy, and allow this wealth to pour into our communities – including right here in Pennsylvania.According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following:increase GDP by more than $100 billion annuallyadd over 500,000 new jobs annuallyincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 yearsincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decadesincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama – creating countless more jobs in the process.Overall, my entire economic plan – tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform – will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, assuming an average growth rate of 3.5 percent, and I believe we will reach 4% growth.My tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate, for small and large businesses, down from 35 percent today – turning America into a jobs magnet. Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percent.Income taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut – including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts.My plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations, and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety. Overregulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year.On energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas, and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow.Finally, my plan includes a renegotiation of America's trade deals, and the enforcement of trade rules, to increase jobs and wealth inside the United States. Strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long-term.It is perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.Compare that to my opponent. She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, the offshoring of American jobs, and the aggressive restriction of American energy production. Her plan will help only her wealthy donors, and global special interests, who benefit from the rigged system.Hillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracturing in most places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areas.This will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economy.Her plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources.She also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplace.According to the Wall Street Journal, ""Overall, more than a dozen [fossil fuel] projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012, with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo.""Examples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850 million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8 billion Liquid Natural Gas export facility, among others.Billions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda.The platform produced by Hillary Clinton's party this year also calls for a ""price on carbon."" That's just political-speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production – a tax on American consumers.And remember, every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country – often foreign countries not very friendly to us.That not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries, but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards.That is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America's vast energy reserves.We need an America-First energy plan.This means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies.The development of the Marcellus and Utica Shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions – more jobs, higher wages, a larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for a change, instead of out of our country.Hillary Clinton's war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion dollars.She has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production – which supports 10 million jobs in the United States.Access to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.We have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy. The Shale Energy Revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families.At the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel.But federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically, and energy production in general.Currently, less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development.Almost 90% of our nation's offshore acreage is off-limits to energy production.Our energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources.That means we will end the war on coal.I will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.We will eliminate the highly-invasive ""Waters of the US"" rule, and scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan – these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate.I will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air, and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans.I believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats. My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.It will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success.It will be a future of new technology, new innovation, and new solutions.It will be a future we can achieve together, beginning with a victory on November 8th.We Will make America Wealthy Again.We Will make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.","UCSB"
"125",2016-09-30,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Suburban Collection Showplace in Novi, Michigan","I am going to fight so hard for all of you, and I am going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and your country.In 39 days, we are going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win the White House.It is going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs, your wealth, and your middle class.We are going to take on the arrogant, corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of American prosperity – a theft that has left behind crumbling schools, roads, bridges and a depleted military.It is time to rebuild Detroit. It is time to rebuild Michigan. It is time to rebuild the United States of America.Hillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have ripped the jobs right out of Michigan. These are the people whose policies raided the jobs from Detroit. That's how she gets rich – by taking your jobs and your money away from you.That's why Hillary Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100% approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The deal she called the ""Gold Standard."" The TPP will economically devastate Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and so many other states across this country.Hillary Clinton's donors want the TPP – and their wish is her command.These special interests pay her for speeches. They pay her Foundation. They pay her husband. In return, they GET YOUR JOBS. Like I've been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is remember these words: FOLLOW THE MONEY.Hillary Clinton praised or pushed TPP on 45 separate occasions. Her close associate and confidant, Terry McAuliffe, said she'd pass it. Her husband has talked it up. Everyone knows she's for it, because she doesn't believe in protecting American Sovereignty.Hillary Clinton only believes in protecting one thing: her donors.Of the 262 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP, 82 or nearly 1 in 3 donated between $21 and $67 million to the Clinton Foundation.9 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP paid Hillary Clinton $2.7 million for paid speeches.Of the 12 signatory countries that are parties to TPP, 3 gave between $6 and $15 million to the Clinton Foundation.At least 4 lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign.On November 8th, We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and we are going to do something that has been a long, long time coming: WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICA FIRST.Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.I am an outsider fighting for you.Hillary Clinton is the one who rigged the system.We are the ones who are going to change the system so it's fair and just for every American.We have a movement. The corrupt establishment is panicking because they know how hard it is to stop us. The news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help Hillary Clinton and to cling to their power and prestige.The arrogant political class doesn't believe in protecting jobs and wages for Americans.They don't believe in secure borders and strong walls.These Washington and Wall Street insiders don't believe in hiring more police, producing more American energy, or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools.For decades, we've talked about the corruption, incompetence, and failures of our leaders. 2016 is our long-awaited chance to fix the problem – and to hold our politicians accountable. If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system: show up and vote.When you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding this county dry, and imagine the look on their faces when you tell all of them: you're fired.In their place, will be a new government. We are the Party of Abraham Lincoln, and once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We are going to do it together. In 39 days, everything is going to change.Now, the media doesn't want to talk about Hillary Clinton and her corruption. So we are going to spell it out for them today.The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.We are going to call them the FBI Immunity Five. So here's my question for Hillary Clinton: can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration?And here is the demand I am making today to President Obama: will you pledge, here and now, not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itself?No one is above the law. Not even Hillary Clinton.Clinton and her cronies will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country.Remember the Clinton pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money?The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men ""super-predators.""To the African-American community, let me ask you this question: are you better off than you were eight years ago? If not, vote for Donald Trump. I will bring jobs, great education, and safe neighborhoods.If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results.Look at what the Democrats have done to Detroit. Half of Detroit residents do not work. Nearly 40% of the city lives in poverty. It's the second most dangerous city in America, according to the FBI.This is the legacy of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated.We will unleash the power of American energy.The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in Michigan, will be renegotiated – and we will bring back your auto-manufacturing.Michigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO – both deals pushed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.Ford is moving its small car production to Mexico.It used to be that the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.Hillary Clinton also gave us the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, which has cost this country another 100,000 jobs.Hillary opposed the Korea deal when she was running for President in 2007. She campaigned right here in Michigan and said the Korea deal ""will hurt the us auto industry, increase our trade deficit, cost us good middle-class jobs and make America less competitive."" She pledged to reject the deal.But she lied to all of you, just like she lied about her emails.Once installed as Secretary of State, she supported it and called it a ""cutting-edge deal."" She rammed it through to adoption – she always does whatever the donors tell her to do, no matter how it impacts our families, schools and communities.The U.S. trade deficit with Korea in the top ten products that Michigan exports to Korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose. This is what Hillary Clinton did to your state.According to the Economic Policy Institute, Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members, and the country lost 740,000 manufacturing jobs as a result of that deficit last year. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved, as Hillary Clinton is planning to do.Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.She even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the internet, which is happening tomorrow. Hillary Clinton's website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a ""global community of stakeholders.""Someone needs to inform Hillary Clinton it's not the job of our leaders to represent a ""global community."" It's the job of our leaders to represent American citizens. Losing control of the internet to other foreign entities is just one more way Obama-Clinton have sold out the citizens of this country.Hillary Clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the American people.I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.Have you ever wondered why it is that all the things that the American people want never seem to happen?The reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.Just look at how badly she messed up on the Iran deal. And, just today, we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released, the United States signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two Iranian banks involved in financing Iran's missile programs.Hillary Clinton is there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.Together, we can accomplish anything we want.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have 39 days until the election. You have 39 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.Here are just some of the great things that will happen for your country:We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring our manufacturing jobs back to Michigan; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars – made in Michigan – will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.To the people of Michigan, I promise you this –We will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless!","UCSB"
"127",2016-10-03,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Budweiser Events Center in Loveland, Colorado","It is a privilege to be here this morning with so many distinguished members of our armed services.Before we get started with our Q & A, I'd like to address one of the most important aspects of America's national security, and that's Cyber Security.To truly make America safe, we must make cybersecurity a major priority for both the government and the private sector.Cyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States.As President, improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my Administration.One of the very first things I will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses, including all vital infrastructure.Cyber-attacks from foreign governments, especially China, Russia, and North Korea along with non-state terrorist actors and organized criminal groups, constitute one of our most critical national security concerns.Hillary Clinton's only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive cover-up, and putting the entire nation in harm's way. The fact that a former Senator and Secretary of State claimed not to know what the letter ""C"" means is just one more example of why she's unfit to hold public office.The scope of our cyber security problem is enormous. Our government, our businesses, our trade secrets, and our citizens' most sensitive information are all facing constant cyber attacks.Just consider some of these recent hacks:JP Morgan Chase had 73 million emails stolen.E-Bay was invaded and gave up 150 million passwords.Target was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbers.Attacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the United States and around the world, and the costs in our privacy, our security and on our financial sector are extraordinary.Identify theft, financial laundering, as well as ransom ware – involving the extortion of a hacked institution – are all becoming increasingly common.Incredibly, hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who underwent FBI background investigations.The information hacked contains facts discovered by the FBI in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the Federal Government. It is a treasure trove which can be easily used for blackmail.The fact that this highly classified information was so poorly protected demonstrates that cyber security is just one more area where the Obama Administration has failed.We should not let this be like the history of the Mafia which was allowed to grow into a nation-wide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long time.We can learn from this history that when the Department of Justice, the FBI, the DEA and state and local police and prosecutors were combined in Task Forces directed at the Mafia, they were able to have great success in prosecuting them, seizing their business interests and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society.As President, I will instruct the Department of Justice to create Joint Task Forces throughout the United States to work together with Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this still-developing area of crime.I will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense. I will also ask my Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our Cyber Command.As a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources, the United States must possess the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter-attacks. This is the warfare of the future, America's dominance in this arena must be unquestioned.Cyber security is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as well.For non-state terror actors, the United States must develop the ability – no matter how difficult – to track down and incapacitate those responsible. We should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists.To enhance the defense of the other agencies of government, including our law enforcement agencies, we will put together a team of the best military, civilian and private sector cyber security experts to comprehensively review all of our cyber security systems and technology.The Cyber Review Team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first, but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits.I will also require that follow-up reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved.The review will include providing exact recommendations for the best combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies.This will include the various methods of internal monitoring, attack and penetration, investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees, and identity protection for government employees.The review team will also remain current on the constantly-evolving new methods of attack, and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before major breaches occur.This group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials, requiring them to follow best practices.They will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them, along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense.Those who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law. I will appoint an Attorney General who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate. My Attorney General will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice.Today is just the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion of how to protect ourselves from modern cyber-crime and evolving national security threats, and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century.","UCSB"
"128",2016-10-04,"Donald Trump","Remarks at Prescott Valley Event Center in Prescott Valley, Arizona","Thank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Arizona.In 35 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.I am going to make America Rich again.I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.My economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.I want to send our best wishes to the great governor Mike Pence, as he prepares for his debate tonight. The debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow, versus the small and petty Clinton campaign that is stuck in the past. We are change – she is four more years of Obama.Clinton can't talk about the real problems facing our country because she's the one who helped create all of our problems in the first place. To hide her corruption, she deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse – she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, unleashing death and destruction. And she failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.Now, after years of failure, she complains about how I've used the tax laws to my benefit. Then why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I could not have used them the way I did? She could have changed those laws when she was in the Senate. The reason that she did not is that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same as I did.I know all their names, and I know who they are, but it's not up to me to make them public figures.Two public Hillary supporters who are known are George Soros, who declared losses of $1.5 billion in just six months, and Warren Buffet who, in 2014, declared losses of $873 million.I know how the tax code works better than anyone, and I am going to fix it so it is fair, and just, and works for you and your family.I've made my money as a highly-successful private businessperson following the law. Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government office.The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.The homicide rate last year experienced its largest single-year increase in 45 years.Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the country.Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare – even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.The federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.We are nation divided, with race riots in the streets.Our college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs – or certainly not the jobs they want.Overseas, our failed leaders have empowered Iran, unleashed ISIS, and turned Iraq, Libya and Syria into absolute chaos.Our allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.America needs a turnaround.America needs a comeback.America needs a change.That is why I am running.First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.The architect of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, admitted that the whole sales pitch was a lie – he called it the ""stupidity of the American voter."" But the only stupidity was the stupidity of our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections of the American people.Do you remember all the lies? President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.Now, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.He has absolutely trashed President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare ""one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party of our country.""Bill has a different view. Here is what bill said:He just said it's a ""crazy system,"" where people end up with ""premiums doubled and coverage cut in half."" He said ""it's the craziest thing in the world.""Bill Clinton said:""people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies."" Clinton added that it ""doesn't make any sense,"" and that ""the insurance model doesn't work.""I couldn't agree more. Which is why, on my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.This is essential for Arizona. Because of Obamacare, most of the state will only have 1 carrier next year, and premiums are expected to go up by 49% next year.There is only 1 way to stop it: to vote for Trump. Early ballots are mailed out on October 12th, and you need to mail them back in as early as you possibly can.Next, we are going to unleash American energyI just met with energy producers in Colorado, and they are pleading with the government to let them create jobs and wealth in the United States.As part our plan to reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs, we are going to lift the restrictions on shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal, and all forms of job-producing American energy.Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revivalChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money – the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.When I am President, we will start making things in America again.Companies like Apple, will start making their computers and iPhones in our country.Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.Since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.Never in history has a country surrendered so much of its wealth to foreign countries.As the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.Jobs will leave from other countries and come into the United States.Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay –and new hope.But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.Security begins at the border.A nation that doesn't control is borders is not a nation.A country that doesn't protect its people isn't a country.A government that doesn't put its own citizens first is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.Here are some heartbreaking examples of how our government has failed our citizens.Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.In California, a 64-yeard old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.Also in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 – he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant with three gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer – but despite these previous crimes, he had not been deported.A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.There are more than 2 million criminal aliens in the county right now – when I am President, we are getting them out, and quickly.On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just yesterday, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington.Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiancй visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.Hillary is for open borders.I am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.For the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.We also have the endorsement of Sheriff Joe.We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. The chaos, the violence and the crime will come to an end – beginning in January of 2017.We are going to end the government corruptionHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails – after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate.The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.We have become a Banana Republic.Yesterday, we learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it – by sending in your ballots.We are also going to fix our inner cities45% of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty.58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, six years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime. They've horribly failed and abused our African-American and Latino communities.To those African-Americans and Latinos suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.To everyone in the country I say: what do you have to lose?We will have safe communities for EVERYONE.School choice for your children.Great trade deals that bring jobs into our country, not out of our country.Everyone will be included in the American Dream.Here are the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest job-creating tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We are going to rebuild America.We are going to revitalize America.And we are going to unite America.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. We're going to make history. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.You're going to look back at this event, and you're going to look back at November 8th, or the day you put in your early ballot, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.You are going to be proud of your country again, and you are going to be proud of your President again.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. A vote for commonsense government, solutions to problems. It's a vote for jobs, jobs, jobs.It's a vote for a government of, by and for the people.All together, we are going to –Make America wealthy again.We are going to make America strong again.We are going to make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again.","UCSB"

Hillary wants to effectively abolish the 2ndamendment, by overturning D.C. vs. Heller and declaring that guns are not a private right. We are also going to conserve your land and natural resources for hunters, anglers, and all who enjoy the outdoors.Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revivalMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.But to bring back our jobs, we must fix our trade deals – and stand up to countries that cheat.China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money – the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore.

I'm going to stop the jobs from leaving our country – and I'm going to bring millions of new jobs back into our country.It's going to be a new day in America.For too long, we've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.We will also lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.Thousands of new companies, millions of new jobs, and trillions of dollars in new wealth will come pouring into the United States.But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.Security begins at the border.Hillary Clinton is unfit to be President because she supports open borders.In fact, as Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be freed into our country because their own countries wouldn't take them back -- it was her job to cancel visas to countries that refused to take back their criminals.But she didn't do it.The ICE officers, who endorsed me – their first endorsement of a candidate ever – issued a lengthy statement on Hillary Clinton's immigration plans.Let me read from it.Again, this all a quote from the ICE officers: ""Hillary Clinton has promised the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.""""Her radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S. borders.""Their quote continues.""She proposes to keep and expand executive amnesty, to expand catch- and-release, to expand President Obama's non-enforcement priorities to the point where there is virtually no real immigration enforcement or policing of visa overstays, to support Sanctuary Cities, to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants, to grant amnesty within 100 days, to extend Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through amnesty, plus a 550% increase in the admission of Syrian refugees.""The ICE officers conclude by saying: ""Her plan is total amnesty plus open borders.""That whole quote is from the nation's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers. In short, Hillary's immigration stance is disqualifying.The first duty of the President of the United States is to protect the citizens of the United States – anyone who fails to understand that is unworthy to lead this nation.There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with convictions in the country right now, and many more criminal illegal immigrants who have committed severe offenses but escaped the law entirely – when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists.Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington State.The Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancй visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.I am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We are also going to end the government corruptionHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails – after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.It's worse than Watergate.Hillary Clinton put her public office up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to show up and vote.We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.I will be your greatest champion, and I will deliver real change and justice in your communities.I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; lift restrictions on all sources of American energy, and put the miners and steelworkers back to work; end Common Core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.This Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation – and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. You are voting to believe in your future. You are voting to believe in your country.All together, we are going to –Make America wealthy again.We are going to make America strong again.We are going to make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again.","UCSB"
"131",2016-10-11,"Donald Trump","Excerpts of Remarks at Aaron Bessant Park in Panama City, Florida","The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election. This election will determine whether we remain a free country, or we become a corrupt Banana Republic controlled by large donors and foreign governments.The election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country.Today we learned the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation, so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. This is collusion and corruption of the highest order, and is one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. We have to investigate the investigation.Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena – and then destroyed her phones with a hammer – all to cover-up her crimes. People have gone to jail for doing far less. She also lost as much as $6 billion taxpayer dollars.These Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty. This criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations....Even Chelsea Clinton, the WikiLeaks emails show, expressed ""serious concerns"" about conflicts of interests at the Clinton Foundation and State Department.During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti. The Haitian community has contributed so much to this country. I also learned from them, firsthand, how much they despise the Clintons for what they did to the people of Haiti.New emails revealed today by ABC News show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from ""Friends of Bill"" or ""William Jefferson Clinton VIPs"" so that their business interests or contracts would receive special treatment.People who were labeled ""Not Friends of Bill"" were placed on the sidelines.In their biggest project, the Clintons used $400 million in aid and U.S. taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a sweatshop. And guess who set it up? Cheryl Mills, Hillary's Chief of Staff who helped destroy her emails, and then got an immunity deal from the FBI that included the destruction of her computer.The company that benefitted from Mills' actions then invested in a company owned by Cheryl Mills.Today, as Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti last time.To all of our friends in Haiti, your day of justice is coming, and it arrives on November 8th.Not only have the Clintons ripped off Haiti, but the new emails show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholics. This is deeply offensive. It's just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton Campaign has for everyday Americans. We've all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement, secret service, and others in uniform. She even smeared all of America's police officers as essentially racist.I'm proud of the fact that I have always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel.The WikiLeaks emails show that Hillary's staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile.The emails also show, yet again, that the DNC rigged the Democratic election to give it to Hillary Clinton. The DNC Vice Chair was caught feeding information about Bernie Sanders' plans to the Clinton Campaign.To all the Bernie voters out there: don't vote for a Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions, more Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals, and – as confirmed by Wikileaks – she also wants to cut Medicare and Social Security....Wikileaks also shows something I have been warning about for a very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. It's just one more way the system is rigged.Reporters who work for these outlets – like the Washington Post, or the New York Times – may think of themselves as journalists, but they are actually just cogs in a corporate political machine.The emails show the New York Times, Boston Globe, Univision and Jon Harwood of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons, and smother the Clintons with praise. The NYT even gave Clinton veto power of her quotes in their stories. It's called corruption.The emails also show that the Hillary was given the CNN townhall questions before her big debate against Bernie Sanders. Dona Brazile, the DNC Vice Chair, emailed: ""from time to time I get the questions in advance.""The media can't report on the establishment because the media is the establishment. And they're all teamed up against you, the American people....On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.We are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on borders, on trade, on foreign policy, on the economy, and so much more. We are going to replace the failed leadership in Washington who have betrayed you, squandered our wealth, and sold our country.I am asking all Americans – Republicans, Independents and Democrats – to join us in our campaign to give our government back to the American people.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation – and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again.","UCSB"
"132",2016-10-12,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Southeastern Livestock Pavilion in Ocala, Florida","Thank you everybody. This is a big, big crowd, you know? [applause]I'll tell you the same thing, however, the only people that will be shown on television won't be the 15,000 people, it'll be this group right over here. [applause]So, the good news is, you have better seats, or standing room only, but you have better, but they're going to be more famous, right? They're going to be more famous. [applause]Look, we want to have the cameras circle around and show this crowd, will you do that cameras? [applause]Go ahead cameras. [applause]They never do it. They never do it, so we won't waste our time, it's just the dishonest media. Look. [applause]We love being here, I love being with you. I love this state, as you know, I'm here all the time. [applause]In 27 days, we're going to win Florida [applause]and we're going to win back the White House. [applause]And that's what's happening folks, that's what's happening. [applause]We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to end illegal immigration, we're going to renegotiate our totally disastrous I mean these deals, aye yai yai the trade deals the worst. We're going to renegotiate those trade deals, reduce surging crime. You saw what happened the other day, murders in the United States, the highest level in 45 years. You don't hear that from the press. [booing]We're going to cut taxes big league. Crooked Hillary is going to raise taxes. We're going to cut taxes and regulations. We're going to reduce the costs of education. By the way, we're going end the Common Core, and we're bringing our education local. [applause]We're going to lift the restrictions on American Energy and deliver real change for our great American people; it's time. [applause]And when it comes to international government, to massive trade deals, and to America's borders, we're going to defend the freedom and sovereignty of the United States of America like never before. [applause]And we are going to once again put America first. [applause]The deadline for voter register who is not registered? Is there anybody in here not registered? If you're not registered, get the hell out of here, OK? [applause]There's a nice looking young guy hey listen, leave right now and go and register. [applause]They just extended it for a little while, so right after you, raise your right hand. Do you promise you're going to register after this? If you like what I say, OK, if you like what I say. [applause]Seriously, I'm curious, who is not registered in this room? OK, all young people. Believe me, the young people like me better than Bernie, I'm telling you. [applause]Because with me, when you graduate from college, you're going to come out and you're going to have a vast array of jobs. OK, right? [applause]So go out and register, and we're going to have an awfully big I'll tell you what, honestly, we're going to have a big four years, eight years, we're going to have a big, great future for our country. [applause]Also, you can request an absentee ballot and you can vote by mail, if necessary. So, register, request a ballot.Thank you. I love you. I love you, too.The Hillary Clinton documents have you been seeing this, what's going on? Released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in November and how unattractive and dishonest our country has become. The election of Hillary Clinton would lead, in my opinion, to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it. She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office. And I don't think it would be close. The WikiLeaks e-mails show the Department of Justice fed information, did you see this? to the Clinton campaign.So think of this. The Department of Justice, you remember that whole deal with Wild Bill getting on the back of an airplane, just happened to be in Arizona. He was gonna play golf. It was 110 degrees.But he gets on the back of the airplane to meet with the Attorney General to talk about his golf game and to talk about his grandkids. He was there for 39 minutes. [booing]I think most of us know what happened. [booing]So fed information, Department of Justice fed information think of this to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. Now, did you ever hear [booing]Did you ever hear anything like this? [booing]And, and by the way, these dishonest people, mainstream media, they don't talk about this. They don't talk about this. Now, if I sneeze if Donald Trump sneezes today, it's a major story. [applause]Here you have Department of Justice coming to see them to brief them prior to their interview. Folks, this is out of control.And the FBI unbelievable people. You have incredible people in the FBI. I would be willing to be that they are so ashamed of what's happened at the upper level. I would be willing to bet that they don't even sleep at night.These are great people. These are great Americans. And they can't believe what's going on.This corruption and collision is just one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. [applause]Our country has never been so low. In addition to a special prosecutor to look into what happened and all of the corruption, and all of the we'll say so called crime. But look, when somebody deletes 33,000 e-mails after getting a subpoena. But we have to also remember this remember this. This is maybe in a sense even more important. We have to investigate the investigation. [applause]We have to investigate the investigation. [applause]We've never had a case like this. And even Congress, you know, is sort of they've never had this before, because there's no event like this that ever took place. Normally, Congress you know she lied to Congress. She lied to the FBI. And remember, he said she was negligent. She was all the things you needed to be, but she lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she lied to everybody she even lied in the debates about the gold standard, right. Remember, she said, I never said gold standard. And remember when I said line in the sand? She said, I wasn't secretary of state. I said, I think you were, but let's see even the press said she was secretary of state, so she lied about that. But think of this. Think of this. There's never been a time like this in our country. And Congress, in all fairness and I'm so disappointed in them. I am so disappointed in Congress. I am so disappointed. [applause]And I mean both sides. I'm not talking Republican Dem I'm talking everybody. To allow a thing like this to go this is crime at the highest level. She shouldn't be allowed to run for president. You know that. [applause]Other people's lives have been ruined, destroyed, for doing a tiny fraction of what she did. You saw the man with the book, he had to give back all the royalties and went through hell. You saw the man with the picture of the submarine, his mother goes around, she's devastated, devastated. Took pictures of a submarine. And you take a look at this. So we have to investigate the investigation, and Congress but I speak to Congressmen. They don't know what to do. Because normally, they vote and they hand it over to the FBI and the Justice Department. But the FBI and the Justice Department won't do anything, so they don't know what to do. [booing]Now, they do make laws. Maybe they have to make up a law for a case like this. But they take these criminal acts, in my opinion, criminal acts, hand them over to the FBI, the FBI actually acknowledge that even, frankly, could have gone that speech could have been 10 times longer. But all of these things yes, she did this, yes, she did this, yes, she did that, yes, she did that, but we're not going to do anything, right but what do you do when you hand them over to the FBI and the Justice Department and that's the end of it? We have never been in a position like this. I'm so embarrassed by what's taken place, and I'm very, very disappointed in Congress because our people, our politicians I don't know, do they make a deal where everybody protects each other in Washington? Maybe that's it. I really believe it. I really believe it. I almost say, listen, we're going to leave you alone, but when it's our turn, you have to leave them alone. Do they make deals like this? This is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I've ever seen involving justice in the United States in the history of the United States. We have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency, and she has the Justice Department, where she essentially told the AG in the speech or a talk that she'd appoint her AG again. And this is the person that's supposed to be ruling? Folks, whether I win, lose, or draw, I'm ashamed of what's happened to our country and so are you. [applause]Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails. And did you see, two days ago, boxes of e-mails and other things were missing? They were missing. So she deleted 33,000 e-mails and bleached them. By the way, nobody bleaches; nobody I have people that are sophisticated in this world. They never even heard of it. They called it acid wash, meaning you can never retrieve them, although I have a feeling that the NSA has them. They don't want them. They don't want to get them. I have a feeling. [applause]So then she did this after, not before. Before would be bad. She did this after getting a congressional subpoena.Now, if your friend is suing you in a regular lawsuit, and you do that, you go to jail. Here's the United States Congress subpoenas her e-mails and other things, and she deletes the e-mails, saying there are 33,000 e-mails remember? for the wedding and for yoga classes 33,000 e-mails. [applause]And then and then after all of that, now they're missing two boxes of perhaps the most important of the group.And what about her law firm? You know what? She's using a phenomenal law firm. I know the firm. Phenomenal law firm. They're the ones that did all this stuff. Remember, they said we made a ruling they were work-related. You can't do that. If they're work- related, what you do is you show them you show them and you get them. It's a law firm nobody ever mentions. The law firm is unbelievable. It's very powerful. OK? Obviously, they've done a great job. But that law firm should be implicated in this crime. OK? [applause]They're the ones they got rid of all this stuff. The law firm got rid of all this stuff. And they should be implicated because they have committed a crime. They are not supposed to say, ""Oh, we got rid of most of it."" That law firm that I know very well, as I said total professionals, total insiders they got rid of 33,000 and much more than that. It is one of the great miscarriages of justice. So then she destroyed her phones, some with a hammer, to cover up her crimes. Now, how many of you people have gotten rid of cell phones and you start whacking them with a hammer? Has any please raise your hand? Please. One. What business are you in? I see two hands. We have 15,000. Two hands. Anybody else? It is so disgraceful. It's so embarrassing. And by the way, we're going to go over some of the WikiLeaks stuff. The press hardly reports it. They hardly report it. She did a big number of Catholics, horrible number on Catholics. She did a horrible number on evangelicals through her people. And they hardly report it. While she was secretary of state, she lost or disappeared almost $6 billion. Does anyone know that? No. How do you lose $6 billion? Even Chelsea Clinton in the WikiLeaks emails expressed, quote, ""serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department."" Americans have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption. It's corruption Whitewater, cattle. [applause]Never is with these people. Remember years ago most of you are too young to remember. Remember the cattle? She bought some cattle and she had the greatest return, like almost in the history of cattle deals? And some of these professional cattlemen and cattle women they say, boy, she's really good at this stuff. They'd been doing it all their lives, they had never had a return like that. It's corruption, folks. It's corruption. They understood that, by the way. They're smart, they got it very quickly.This will finally be the year the American people say, enough is enough. During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti, and you see what's going on in Haiti, it's a horrible thing. And you see what's going on with Clinton, it's a horrible thing. These are not fans of Clinton. That, I can tell you. They despise the Clintons for what they did to the Haitian people. New e-mails revealed by ABC News just yesterday show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. They kept cashing in. As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of Bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment, while those who were not special friends would be put permanently on the sidelines. And remember this. Hillary's brother, running a gold mine, put on the gold Tony, you saw Tony. Tony. Anybody want to hire Tony? He's put on the board of a big gold mine company, having to do with Haiti. It's so bad. Look, we're in a rigged system, folks. This is a rigged, rigged system. You saw so many of the things. I'll tell you, this WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart you got to read it. And you got to maybe get it, because they're not putting it out. They want to put it out, but they can't do that, because without the media and without the press, Hillary Clinton would be nothing. She'd be nothing. Zero. [applause]And by the way, did everybody see the debate the other day, yes? [applause]So they had nine online polls. Some of them had us 90 to 10, 80 to 20. ""Time Magazine"" had like a massive look, ""Time Magazine"" is no friend of mine except they put me on the cover so much. Not because they like me, because they like selling magazines. But ""Time Magazine"" it was total destruction. And then the next morning, she walks in and says, did everybody see the debate? People go, yes, yes. Did we beat her or what? I look so forward[applause]I do. I look so forward to the next one in Las Vegas.As Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time. To all our friends in Little Haiti they're great people. I mean, I spent a long time these are people that are incredible. They have the warmest feeling, the warmest heart. But to all of our friends in Little Haiti, your day of justice is coming, believe me. [applause]And it arrives on November 8. November 8, get out and vote.The new e-mails also show members of the Clinton team viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals. They attacked Catholics and evangelicals. [booing]Viciously. [booing]And that won't be tolerated but it won't be tolerated by the voters. Tell you what anybody of religion I really think you have to vote for Donald Trump to be honest with you. I really do believe it. [applause]And in all of the primaries you saw that. I wasn't expected to win with evangelicals but once we got started and once they heard my message as opposed to other people's messages we really we won big with evangelicals. They're incredible people. [applause]Remember the Johnson Amendment. We're gonna get rid of that Johnson Amendment. Just remember that. [applause]These emails are just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign has for everyday faithful Americans. True. The Wikileaks email show that Hillary Clinton's staff, even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile. Smile Hillary. Smile. [applause]Hey folks, we have to get back to work. Our country's in trouble. We can't play games anymore. Smile. You believe it? Smile. [applause]And how about where it said to the public you say this, but to the others that give you the money you say that. I'll tell you. It's so revealing somebody's going to do a great book on that, because the press just did not little tiny stories, big, big things. Getting answers for debates and questions for debates, before the debate takes place. How about that? I'll tell you what. Can you imagine me, if any of this stuff pertained to me? Front page headlines all over the world, Donald Trump oh well, we've been there and we seem to be doing really well. Hillary Clinton, commonly referred to as Crooked Hillary, thinks that you all of you are deplorable and totally irredeemable. [applause]I actually think irredeemable is worse, I don't know. I'm the only one. Deplorable and irredeemable. Irredeemable meaning, meaning you can never, ever come back. I call you hard-working American patriots, and together we are going to save this country and we are going to make America great again. [applause]And it's hot as hell in here but I don't care. [applause]Call it Florida, right? Florida. [applause]Emails also show that the DNC vice-chair was feeding information so much information to the candidate. Oh man, I want that why can't the Republicans do that? Why can't Reince feed me information prior to a debate. I'm so angry at the Republicans I want to be fed information like Hillary gets. [applause]And we still beat her badly, right? So I mean what's the big deal? But I want information. The Republicans are not doing their job. They should be able to get me all of the questions prior to the debate. This all comes after a secret tape that shows Hillary Clinton calling Bernie voters now look Bernie I feel sorry for Bernie.He made a deal with the devil and he blew his reputation. But she called Bernie voters basement dwellers.So all of the Bernie votes out there, join our movement, like all of these young people. We're going to fix our trade deals and get special interests out of government. And by the way, by the time this ends, I'll have over a hundred million dollars of my money in this thing, right, which means that's $100 million of people that don't have to give me money and say, Donald, will you do this, will you do that, will you do that? [applause]That's a lot of money. [applause]And I asked her the other night, I said, you know, I will have over a hundred million and that's a lot of money. If I lose, I'm going to be so angry at Florida. [laughter]I'll still love you, I think. Maybe not. [applause]You know, one of the pundits said, and you've heard me say this maybe, but they said, Mr. Trump, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose. You have done the single greatest job. nobody's ever done a thing like this before. No matter where we go it's like this. But... [applause]They said it's the single Bill O'Reilly said it, but many peoples said, it's the single greatest political phenomena they've ever seen. I said, wait a minute, you're wrong. If I don't win on November 8th, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy and money of anything I've ever done, because we're not going to be able to reduce your taxes, we're not going to be able to save your Second Amendment, appoint Supreme Court judges, take care of you vets, fix up your depleted, very depleted the greatest people on earth but our military is so depleted. We're going to take care of a lot of things, including getting the drugs out. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions. What a mess did she do does she go down as the all-time worst? More Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals. And as WikiLeaks showed, she wants to cut your Medicare and Social Security benefits. You didn't see that. [booing]See? And I'm not going to. The press doesn't report that she wants to cut your Social Security. And she wants to cut Medicare and one of the big advantages of me having a rather large microphone, meaning a lot of people are listening, is that I can talk about WikiLeaks and look it's on al the television networks live. We're live. [applause]Amazing. [applause]I think they are just turning them all off now. Watch. You go home, they'll say, why did it end so abruptly?A vote for Trump is a vote for America first and it's a vote to protect Medicare and Social Security and lower your taxes. [applause]Big, big tax decrease. We're going to lower your taxes. WikiLeaks also shows something I've been warning about for a very, very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. [booing] It's one of the biggest ways that our system is rigged. And I was the first one to use that term when I was running in the primaries when I won Louisiana and I got fewer delegates than people that I beat easily. And my people said, oh no, that's the way the system I say, well then the system's wrong! How do you win a state and you get less delegates?And I said, this system is rigged! And it was, but we figured out how to win, right? That's what you need. [applause]Won in a landslide. I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party in the primaries system [applause]By far. Wasn't even close. [applause]Reporters who work for these outlets like the Washington Post or the New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but they're actually cogs for a corrupt political machine. That's the Clinton machine. The e-mail show the New York Times, the Boston Globe, Univision who I sued I sued Univision, and I was very happy with what they did. [booing]And this lightweight, you know John Hardwood, this lightweight. This guy who came out, he was shaking. He was so nervous.He asked me the first question, ""Mr. Trump, could you answer this question?"" What a lightweight. They shoulda fired him for what he did.John Harwood. I hate to make him famous but 'cause nobody ever heard of him before, but a total lightweight of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons.And reporters smothering the Clintons with praise. The New York Times even gave Clinton a call to give her a veto power over her quotes in a story that was already written. Nobody ever called me and said, ""Hi, Mr. Trump. We wrote a story. Would you read the story and please give us a little feedback. Would you like us to take anything out?"" This system is so rigged. Now, this is all down in the e-mails. She had veto power over what she said.I'll tell you what. I want to have that, too. I want to have veto power.I used to get such good publicity, folks. Now, I mean it's like it's incredible. I used to get my life was so simple.My life was so simple. I had a beautiful, simple life. It was going.I built an unbelievable company. And then I decide to do this, and my life became slightly more complex.You know, we have people in this audience right now that 18 years ago had one great job, they were making more money 18 years ago than they're making now. And now they have two and sometimes three jobs. In other words, they're older and they're working harder, and they're making less. Not a good not a good assemblage of facts. Here's the only good news. I'm also older and working harder than I've ever worked before.OK? That I can tell you. [applause]Including being in this wonderful area at 114 degrees temperature. [applause]Which is great 'cause you go home and you lose weight. I mean why you can't be. You go home, you say, ""I feel great. I lost a lot of weight."" By the way, let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk, and let's see how long she lasts folks. [applause]Oh, what a joke what a total joke. Our country's in such trouble. That's why I'm I it's just so ridiculous.The corporate media can't report on the establishment because the corporate media is the establishment, such a big part of it. We're going to break up the special interest monopoly, and we're going to win this country back for the American people. We're gonna do it, too. [applause]The e-mails also reveal that Hillary Clinton believes in global governments, unlimited immigration unlimited, much more than Obama. From the Middle East, come right in. Come right in. 550 percent more than President Obama, who is grossly incompetent. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing. [applause]And why is he campaigning? We just had a horrible jobs report. We have no growth. You saw GDP at one percent we have no growth. We have a horrible jobs report. China is ripping us off. Japan is ripping us off with the cars. Mexico has a unbelievable deal with us, both on the border I mean, look at our trade deficit with Mexico. And China, and Vietnam, and everybody. Last year, our country had a trade deficit of almost $800 billion. $800 billion. [booing]Who the hell negotiates these deals? I mean, can you believe it? So I say, why the hell is Obama allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton? He's always campaigning, and he's doing his little thing, you know, having a good time. He ought to be out in the White House. He's not there long. He ought to be there working and fixing some of these horrible trade deals and bringing jobs back to our country, not campaigning for a crooked person, for a totally dishonest and crooked person. [applause]Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said, my dream is a hemispheric common market that's not good for your jobs with totally open trade and open borders. 600 million people could pour into the United States. You'll have nothing left. Tell you, if that happens, I know the real estate here, I love the real estate here sell fast. Behind closed doors, when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America. This all came out. She said she wants to dissolve the borders. And here I am saying, we want strong borders. We don't want drugs coming in. We don't want crime coming in. I don't know, maybe I'm wasting my time. Am I wasting my time? I don't think so. [applause]She doesn't want to have any borders. Total amnesty tell you what, folks. This is the last time you'll ever have a chance to save our country. It's not going to happen. You won't be able to. The numbers will be too great. Already, the Republican nominee has a massive disadvantage, and especially when you have the leaders not putting their weight behind the people. They're not putting their weight behind the people[booing]Instead of calling me and saying, congratulations, you did a great job. You absolutely destroyed her in the debate, like everybody said you know, Pat Buchanan wrote the big article today, you saw it—I'm not bragging, I'm just saying—maybe a little bit, but here—he said it was the single greatest debate performance in the history of presidential politics. [applause]So wouldn't you think that Paul Ryan would call and say, good going? In front of just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country. So you know, you'd think that they'd say, great going, Don. Let's go, let's beat this crook. She's a crook. Let's beat her. We got to stop it. No, he doesn't do that. There's a whole deal going on there. I mean, you know, there's a whole deal going on and we're going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But there's a whole sinister deal going on. Crooked Hillary wants to end forever the American independence that our founders gave us. Our great founders are spinning in their graves. Our founders are spinning in their graves like Douglas MacArthur, like George Patton, like our generals. They're spinning in their grave and by the way, General Flynn and all the generals - over 200 admirals and generals have endorsed Donald Trump. Two hundred. Over 200. [applause]Twenty-one congressional Medal of Honor recipients have endorsed Donald Trump. I'll tell you, you know what I like? Very smart, tough people like me. I like that. The smart, tough people, they like Trump. American soldiers have fought and died to win and keep America's freedom and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to open borders, open trade, and world government. And I do believe in free trade but I believe more in smart trade. We're going to make great deals with other countries. We're going to bring jobs back. We're going to bring jobs back. [applause]I'm not running to be president of the world. I'm running to be president of the United States of America. [applause]Oh, I wish those cameras would turn so some time our friends back in New York and back in Pennsylvania and back in Ohio and all these different states, they could see the crowds but they do hear it. You know, when you hear the noise, they say they never show the crowd but you hear the crowd. You can't imitate that noise. [applause]We will never surrender the freedom and sovereignty of the United States. It's going to be America first, America first, America first. [applause]And yesterday, Hillary had Al Gore - climate change. Now, I want - just so you know - do you know that I've won numerous environmental awards? I'm a believer in the environment. It's got to be within reason. I'm a believer. Here's what I want, though. I want immaculately clean water and I want immaculately clean air. That's what I want. That's called climate change. That's called environmental protection [applause]But Hillary had this deal. Very, very lightly attended and I watched on television as they said this is the largest crowd that she's had. You know what she's got? Like a tiny little fraction. Now, they're not going to say look at the crowd with crooked Hillary yesterday. She had Al Gore get up, this poor guy. [booing]I don't know what the hell happened to him. What happened to him? She had Al Gore get up, because don't forget, Obama thinks that climate change is the single biggest and most dangerous problem for the world today. [booing]Not nuclear weapons in the hands of maniacs or in the hands of countries that hate us. No, no that's no problem. Climate change is our problem. I'll tell you how this going, how we're doing folks. If we don't win this election, I don't know what I'm going to do. [applause]I don't know. No, no can you imagine? Here's a guy where we have ISIS that he essentially founded, if you look. Remember I said, founded and he's going to get the medal for having—and I kiddingly. But it's really not that kiddingly but then they put it on Mo Bisely, he found and I says, let me tell you something. When they pulled out of Iraq the way they—we should have never been in Iraq and I was against it and they know it. But we should have never been in Iraq. But when we were, the way he pulled out, he announced when he's leaving, he pulled out everybody instead of leaving, groups behind. And they created a vacuum and ISIS was formed. Now think of this because the biggest thing that came out of the debate in my opinion, and it really came out of the first debate, which if I didn't have fixed microphone or a broken microphone, nobody's been able to tell me, but I watched. Couldn't talk very good because my mike didn't work. But I watched and I said you know, it's interesting. Hillary said she's going to do this and this and this but she's been there for 30 years, she never did it. [applause]And I said to her in the second debate, I said let me ask you a question. Let me—and by the way, you know that so-called Commission on Presidential Debates, the head guy used to work for Bill Clinton. Did you know that? I just found that out. The head guy worked for Bill Clinton. What a rigged deal this is. But here's the story. I have no respect for that group by the way, I have none. It sounds good. Presidential commission, give me a break. [applause]That's why I was so happy what we did to annihilate the enemy the other day. So happy. [applause]Because we're dealing against a very dishonest system. But Hillary, so important, wants to have a radical, and this is very radical, immigration. She wants to radicalize immigration where you have people pouring in. Remember this, the border patrol agents, 16,500 gave me their endorsement. Last week, ICE, ICE, these are great people, you don't hear great things because they're not allowed to do their job. These are people that frankly, would work a lot less. I mean their job's easier if Hillary wins because basically all they have to do is stand there and watch people walk in front of them. ICE, these are great people. Tough people, smart people. First time in their history they endorse me, they've got to work harder, and they endorse me. [applause]And one of the things they told me that I thought was terrible is that she refused when she was secretary of state to make foreign countries take back their criminal aliens. In other words, we have somebody in from a foreign country illegally. The person kills somebody, hurts somebody, robs a store, robs a bank, does all sorts—sells drugs all over the place, poisons our youth. And we want to send them back to the country from which they came and they bring them back and the country says, we're not taking them. Because they're smart. They don't want them. So they bring them back into the United States and put him into our society. I guarantee you, and you can mark my words, and there's a lot of tape running, that won't happen once when Donald Trump is president; not once, guarantee you that. [applause]One convicted criminal alien, she allowed to go free—totally free; killed a young girl named Casey Chadwick; beautiful young girl. The corrupt establishment in Washington wants to surrender America's borders, even as they send our troops overseas to protect the borders of other countries. She'll protect those borders, but not our borders. Casey Chadwick was a great example, and he was let free, and she should be alive today. Jamiel Shaw has a son—had a son, a great young man, killed violently. And I don't know if you know, but killed violently by an illegal immigrant, shot three times in the face for no reason; somebody that wasn't supposed to be here. And you have—you have case after case after case. We're not going to have it anymore. We're not going to be the stupid people anymore. We're not going to be the stupid, weak people anymore. [applause]A Trump administration will secure, control, defend and protect the borders of the United States, as sure as you are standing here today. [applause]We will 100 percent build the wall, 100 percent. [applause]Are you ready? Are you ready? [applause]And who is going to pay for the wall?Audience: ""Mexico""100 percent. They just don't know it yet. They don't know it yet, but 100 percent. They'll pay for the wall.Hey, look, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico and China and all of these countries that are ripping us off and now have no respect. They're going to make less and they're going to like us more. Funny how that works, but it's true. Mexico is making a fortune with trade. They're taking our jobs. So many things. They are going to respect us finally. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Florida has seen a 470 percent increase in heroin deaths. Think of that—think if you have a child—470 percent increase in heroin deaths since 2007. Think of that. Think of your kids and your grandkids. We're going to stop it. And most of it's coming across the southern border. And let me tell you, when we allow ICE and when we allow the Border Patrol agents and when we give them that big beautiful wall with a door in it so people can come in, but they have to come in legally; we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally. [applause]We will stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and others. [applause]But I have a message for the drug dealers, for the gang members and the criminal cartels: Your days are numbered, believe me; your days are numbered. [applause]Hillary also wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees. We don't know anything about them. [booing]This, even though she admitted in private according to WikiLeaks, just out, that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrate—she knows it—they're trying to infiltrate our refugee program. So she said it just yesterday that she knows they're trying to come in through that method, and yet she wants 550 percent more than even Obama's staggeringly high numbers, thousands and thousands. We can't let it happen. And we all have a heart, and we'll build safe havens and we'll have the Gulf States pay because they're not doing their share. Believe me, they're not. They have plenty of money, they'll pay. We can't pay. We owe $20 trillion. 20 trillion, doubled during Obama years. Doubled. He doubled the debt during his years. In fact, the terrorists have already infiltrated our country. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in our 50 states. A record. Attack after attack, including the recent terror strikes in New Jersey, New York, Minnesota, as well as the mall shooting in Washington, were made possible by our extremely open immigration system that's meant only to protect fools, and we're not fools. [booing]So let me state this clearly as I can. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause]She won't even use the word. She won't even use the term. Our incompetent president—I call him our campaign president—our incompetent president won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He won't use it. He tries to explain it. He spends hours trying to explain why. If you don't identify your problem, folks, you're never going to get rid of it. It's only getting worse. And remember, I said it before, we've started off when he became president with no ISIS. Nobody head the term ISIS, which he calls ISIL, right. You know why he does that? Because he likes disturbing all of you. He calls ISIL. But we started off, we had no ISIS. And now, 7 1/2 years later, they're in, they think, 32 countries. And she's going to get rid of them? I can tell you this. They are hoping and they are praying—they are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes president of the United States, because they'll take over not only that part of the world. They'll take over this country, they'll take over this part of the world, believe me. They are hoping. And by the way, she likes to say, they want me—I will be their worst nightmare. I'm going to be their worst nightmare. [applause]And she lied during the debate. Remember when I said the red line in the sand, right? She said, I wasn't secretary of state then, all flustered, all crazy. She was there when they drew the line. I walked out, they said, you know, she was there. Oh, well, she sort of said she wasn't. She was there. It turned out to be a lie. And even the media said that they hated - she lied about that. She lied about many things.She put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons. You know, this horrible Iran deal where they gave $400 million in cash, but it turned out to be $1.7 billion in cash. You couldn't fit that in the back of this arena, that's how much money it is. She gave - they gave that much money to the terrorists, to our enemies. And by the way, our enemies aren't even nice to us. Now they're emboldened.You see the little boats going around our beautiful ships doing all sorts of little things to drive our people crazy. Folks, they're not gonna do that stuff when I'm president, I guarantee ya. [applause]You see the way they captured our ten sailors 'cause they were a little bit in the wrong waters. And instead of saying nicely, ""Hey, listen. You gotta be over there a little bit"", they humiliated the sailors, humiliated their families, and humiliated our country, right. And the only reason they let 'em go is that our payments of $150 billion started the next day. So stupid they're not.And when they fly - they - they flew right alongside of our - our planes the other. You saw that? Their jet fighters.Right, you saw that? And when Putin is buzzing - you know Hillary's tough with Russia.You ever notice anything that goes wrong, they blame Russia. Russia did it. They have no idea. We're being hacked because we have people that don't know what they're doing. They have people. But they always blame Russia and then they say, ""Donald Trump is friends with Putin.""I don't know Putin, folks. I promise. I don't know Putin.What the hell do I have to do with Putin? These people are professional con people. They're con.And this country can't have it. This country can't have it. And - and by the way, Russia, which is buzzing our ships, right.You know, tough Hillary, tough Obama, they're buzzing. You saw that two weeks ago, buzzing, planes going by. They took over - yeah, they took over.You look at Ukraine. They took over during - that was Crimea. They took that over during Obama's reign.You know, tough Obama. He's so tough. He's so tough.So, look, we need competence and we need it fast. Hillary Clinton who turned Libya into a nightmare.How about Libya? How about Benghazi? How about - how about Benghazi where Ambassador Stevens sent 600 different messages to Hillary Clinton, and she didn't even respond. The only one she spoke to was that sleaze Sidney Blumenthal, her friend who Obama told her you cannot deal with, and she did behind Obama's back. [booing]A Trump Administration will stop the reckless interventions, and instead focus on defeating and totally destroying ISIS. We're also going to build up our cyber defenses. Cyber's a big thing. And keep our power grid and our vital infrastructure modern and safe. And the word ""keep"" is an incorrect word because we have to rebuild it. It's a mess. Show Less TextIt's so old, it's falling apart. And we're going to use cyber offense to disrupt the enemy where we need to and keep them from recruiting online.ISIS is taking our children, and taking our kids out of our country because they're using the internet better than we know how to use it. And we're the ones that came up with it. At the same time, we're going to completely rebuild our very depleted military. We're going to take care of our people. [applause]And that includes building state-of-the-art systems of all kind. When it comes to keeping America safe, I believe in three very important words: peace through strength. We don't want to use the military. [applause]But it's got to be there. [applause]And just in closing, to be strong, our country has to be rich again. We're a debtor nation. We're poor. I'm going to make America rich again. [applause]My enemy—our enemies are unbelievable. They love what's happening to our country. They love it. Our energy proposals won't lock the $50 trillion in energy reserves right here in America under our feet.This means new jobs in Florida and many, many other communities. Pennsylvania, Ohio, we're going to take care of our miners, we're going to take care of our steelworkers, we're going to take care of natural gas. We're going to have clean coal. We're going to also have all forms of advanced energy. We also have to repeal and replace it. We will do this and it's so important because it's driving everybody and small businesses and big businesses and our country out of business. Repeal and replace Obamacare. [applause]Bill Clinton, in a rare moment of truth-telling, said last week Obamacare was a crazy system where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. What kind of a system is this? Oh, did he suffer that evening. He went home aye yai yai, poor Bill. He suffered. You see, the next he came back and he said he was only kidding. He was only kidding. It's a disaster. Obamacare - you know, your rates are going up 68 percent. In Texas they had 71 percent. In other communities they're going to go 95 percent and 100 percent, and next year is going to be worse. We have no choice but to absolutely repeal, replace Obamacare we're going to come up with a much better plan for much less money. [applause]As you know also, most counties in the state will only have one insurer to choose from. Obama does that because that way they have a monopoly so they can charge you whatever the hell they want. This is our chance to stop the abusive and horrible and—and something that doesn't work, Obamacare, and save American healthcare, but you have to get out and vote. At the center of our economic revival, we'll be fixing our terrible trade deals. When I announced, seems like a long time now, June 16th coming down with Melania at the escalator, remember, in Trump Tower, was an amazing - that was an amazing thing and we announced that it was a big part. And then I came out and I said Florida and our countries, we have all of these lost jobs. All of our lost manufacturing. We're going to get it back. We're bringing our jobs back. When countries come in and think they're going to steal our companies and our companies are going to go out and fire all of their employees in Florida, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in all of these countries. All of these—everyone. We are not going to allow it to happen. We are not going to allow it. We are going to tell it, you are going to have consequences. The states are not going to put up with it anymore. Our federal government is going to help. We've built other countries at our expense. We have. So, if they come in like they did in Indiana - where Mike Pence, by the way, is doing a great job. [applause]And they take - in the case, they take - Mexico takes care of your air conditioner, and they fire their 1,400 people who were so great to me.And they think they're going to make air conditioners in their beautiful new plant in Mexico, and sell them across the border and make lots of money, and we have all the employment. Not going to happen. We're going to put a 35 percent tax on and they're staying in the United States [applause]And if they don't, we're going to make plenty of money. [applause]We are going to rebuild our country. Our country is going to be a country where you can be proud of again. We're going to use American steel, we're going to use American labor, we are going to come first in all deals. We're not going to make the trade deal where we come in fifth and sixth and seventh and other countries laugh at our stupidity. We are going to build great companies. We are going to expand companies that are now doing poorly. We are going to make our country very rich again. We are going to make our country very safe again. [applause]We are going to make America strong again. And we are going to make America great again. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.","UCSB"
"133",2016-10-13,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Renaissance Hotel in Columbus, Ohio","Thank you.I am so happy to be back here in Columbus. Make sure you request your absentee ballot to vote by mail. And remind your friends and family to do the same.We are now 26 days away from the most important election of our lifetimes.And we've only begun to fight.If we win, we will create a booming and thriving economy for young Americans. We will create safe communities, lower taxes, leaner government, affordable childcare and healthcare, and a government that is honest and decent and fair.We are the campaign of change.We will deliver jobs, opportunity and justice for future generations.I've wanted this race to be about the issues. But the Clinton Campaign has refused to discuss the issues. They only place they want to go is the gutter.So they have slandered and libeled me with false accusations – but we will not let these lies distract us from our campaign.In an earlier speech today, I addressed the fact that I was falsely accused. It is disgraceful that you can have front page articles in the New York Times inventing false claims, without any evidence, any witnesses, anything at all.I want to talk about the policies affecting our lives, and your future.Right now, our government has been taken hostage by global special interests that will stop at nothing to drain every last ounce of wealth from this country for their personal benefit.The greatest weapon wielded by the Clinton Machine is the media. The WikiLeaks emails show that the Clinton Machine and the Corporate Media are one in the same – they collaborate and conspire together.This Washington establishment will stop at nothing to stop all of us.These are the people who have given us decades of endless wars producing only death and bloodshed, but no victory.These are the same people who have flung our doors open to Radical Islam, putting us on the same path to France of multigenerational struggles with violence and extremism embedded in our communities.These are the people who've allowed violent international cartels to invade our country and prey on our most vulnerable citizens. Victims like Marilyn Pharis, raped by an illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal record and beaten to death with a hammer.These are the people who've let drugs pour into our country and poising our children.These are the people who emptied the jobs out of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina and shipped them to other countries.The political powers trying to stop us are the people who've stripped the jobs form our inner cities, trapped millions of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in impoverished, crime-besieged neighborhoods, and left 70 million American women and child in poverty or near the brink of poverty.At the center of this assault on American prosperity is the Clinton Machine. They don't work for you, they don't work for America, the work only for themselves and their donors – including foreign government and foreign actors.Hillary Clinton is a criminal who destroyed 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena.She ignored hundreds of requests for security in Benghazi, causing the deaths of four brave Americans – and then she lied to the faces of the grieving parents about the reason for the attack.She defended a man who violently and viciously raped a 12 year-old girl by horribly smearing and blaming the victim – and the she laughed about getting the rapist off the hook.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary pledged her support for ""open borders."" That means tens of millions of new foreign workers to compete against you for your jobs, your wages, your futures – she's selling out the future of young American, of all backgrounds, to enrich her donors.We won't let it happen.Hillary and her special interest allies want to keep children in our inner cities trapped in failing schools.Under a Trump Administration, disadvantaged children will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.Under President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the national debt has almost doubled.$20 trillion-dollar national debt is a weight around the future of every young person in this country. It would require $120,000 from every millennial in the country to pay off.The new debt added under Obama and Clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the United States 6 times over.Yet, not one penny of that new debt has gone to lowering your tuition.The share of 16-to-28-year-olds not in the labor force has increased to 45 percent during the Obama administration.In a Trump Administration, we will work every day to make America great again for millennials.First, we will Lower the Cost of College and Solve the Student Loan Crisis.Tuition at public four-year institutions was 40% higher in the last school year than it was ten years ago.In all, Americans owe $1.3 trillion on their student loans--more than auto loans, credit card debt, or home equity loans nationwide.Students should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford, and the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.That is why under my student loan program, we would cap repayment to an affordable portion of a borrower's income--12.5%. And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we will let them get on with their lives.That's the nature of the deal we give many public employees today.Every American deserves the same deal, so we will equalize treatment so everyone can start saving for their families and retirement by the time they are 15 years out of college.In addition, I will take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition. If the federal government is going to subsidize student loans, it has a right to expect that colleges work hard to control costs and invest their resources in their students.If colleges refuse to take this responsibility seriously, they will be held accountable--including by reconsidering whether those with huge endowments deserve to keep those endowments tax-exempt.Some schools are paying more to hedge funds and private equity managers than they are spending on tuition assistance--while taxpayers are guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of student loans to pay for rising tuition.We want universities to spend their endowments on their students, not themselves. They need to use that money to cut the college debt and college tuition.Much of the skyrocketing cost of college education is due to the tremendous bloat in college administrators and bureaucrats. According to the Department of Education, the number of college administrators is up more than 60 percent since 1993--ten times the increase in tenured faculty positions.Federal regulations are responsible for much of this administrative bloat. Vanderbilt University estimated that it spends $150 million per year---11 percent of the university's budget--to comply with government regulations.As president, I will immediately take steps to drive down college costs by reducing the unnecessary costs of compliance with federal regulations so that colleges can pass on the savings to students in the form of lower tuition.I will also make it a priority to protect students' rights to free speech on campus. In the past few decades, political correctness has transformed our institutions of higher education from ones that fostered spirited debate, to a place of extreme censorship where students are silenced.We will end the political correctness, and foster free and respectful dialogue.We also have to recognize that traditional four-year degree programs are not the only path to a good job and a good career. We should support schools that allow people to learn skills and practice a trade so young people can have access to the education that's right for them. And we must hold all schools equally accountable for their performance.I will make sure that students have the information they need about all of their options before starting school, and for repaying their student loans upon leaving school.There is a lot of room for improvement in this regard. Currently, students navigate 16 complex repayment plans, 8 forgiveness programs, and 32 deferment and forbearance options—each of these programs has their own nuances and qualifications. I will simplify this confusing maze into a single Income-Based Repayment Program, similar to those that have proved so popular in recent years.We also have to make sure that those who have graduated college and those who are soon to graduate can find a good job to start a good career when they do.Many mothers across this country are worried their kids won't find jobs, and they are right to be worried. One of the biggest threats is outsourcing – jobs for college-educated kids are being sent to other countries. At the same time, companies are importing low-wage workers on H-1B visas to take jobs from young college-trained Americans.We will protect these jobs for Americans.My economic plan – including tax, trade regulatory, and energy reforms – will create 25 million new jobs and allow the private sector to grow at 4 percent per year.This includes reforms to protect and expand the sharing economy--startups like Uber--that have managed to provide great services to consumers, and create lots of jobs in the process.Finally, and most importantly, the foundation for a new prosperity will be a rededication to the constitutional rule of law.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.Together, we are going to make America great again.","UCSB"
"135",2016-10-15,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor, Maine","Thank you.In 24 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, reduce the cost of college, make childcare more affordable, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump Administration.We are going to be a rich country again.We are also going to end government corruption. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency – and the media, donors and special interests who support her will do everything they can to cling to their power and prestige at your expense.The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election.The documents show the Clinton Campaign colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the investigation into Hillary's illegal email server that put your family and your country in danger.They show how the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti.They show the Clinton Campaign viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals.They also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the Clinton Campaign.To cover-up her crimes, Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails – after a Congressional Subpoena – she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence mysteriously went missing.Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes – and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary – supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren – is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.But we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen. We are just getting started.Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries.This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally ""open trade and open borders.""By ""open trade,"" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By ""open borders,"" she means totally unlimited immigration.When she thought no one was listening, Hillary Clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.Either we win the election, or we lose the country.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.A wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.When I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities. I am now doubling-down on that promise, and can guarantee you – we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in, but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves.New Hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country.We have to solve this crisis.I have to give credit to my running mate, Mike Pence, on this issue.Mike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders, while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction.We must make similar efforts a priority for the nation.Not too long ago we read about Christopher Honor and Courtney Griffin -- a young Rockingham County couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other. Their story of prescription drugs, heroin, wait times for treatment, and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemic.First, we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country.The number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008.I've received the first-ever endorsement of our Border Patrol and ICE officers, and under a Trump Administration, we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for good.We are also going to put an end to Sanctuary Cities, which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation.We will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and we will send them swiftly out of our country.We will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs.President Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals.Over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels.Second, we will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service.These traffickers use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the U.S.A Trump administration will crack down on this abuse, and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this mission.Third, we will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worse.It is tragedy enough that so many Americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction. We should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make it even harder for them to get help.The FDA has been far too slow to approve abuse-deterring drugs. And when the FDA has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treat.Recovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives. We prescribe opioids like Oxycontin freely, but when patients become addicted to those drugs, we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need.As president, I'd work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision.At the same time, DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S. We have 5 percent of the world's population, but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids.Finally, we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need.Congress has already taken the first step by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This legislation is an important step.I would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment. These can be a cost effective, appropriate, and humane response to addiction.I would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment.I would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives.I would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration. Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention.Together, these steps will ensure that every American struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needs.But, if we are going to bring hope back to our communities, we not only have to solve our drug crisis but our economic crisis.The wealth has been raided from our country, leaving behind dilapidated communities, rusted out factories, and shattered dreams.At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.The state of New Hampshire has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.Since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, FiatChrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico.Right here in New Hampshire, I visited the Osram Sylvania plant that closed its doors in 2014 and shipped its jobs to China and Mexico.If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.We are going to start making things in America again.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We will have a 10% tax on money parked overseas, bringing trillions in wealth back into our country.Manufacturers will be able to expense the cost of new investment and equipment, to help make our country more competitive.We will lower taxes massively on all Americans – Hillary will raise your taxes massively.We will become the great jobs magnet of the world.Wages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing onto our shores.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation – and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again.","UCSB"

Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your energy bills will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Maine under a Trump Administration.We are going to be a rich country again.We are also going to end government corruption.Hillary speaks in secret to Goldman Sachs – her private position – then lies to you, the public, with her public position. It's all a fraud.Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails – after a Congressional Subpoena – she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of email evidence mysteriously went missing.Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes.

The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.But we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen.We have only just begun to fight.Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally ""open trade and open borders."" Hillary and Bill raise millions of dollars from global interest groups who have no allegiance to this country or its workers.By ""open trade,"" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By ""open borders,"" she means totally unlimited immigration.Either we win the election, or we lose the country.Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism within our shores. She wants us to follow the path of France and Germany and import terrorism directly into the United States.So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, including one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.What kind of government allows its own people to suffer such horrors?As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back. Among those she allowed to go free was a criminal alien who had previously been convicted for shooting a girl in the head – after his release, he viciously murdered a young girl name Casey Chadwick.A wall will not only keep out criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.Drugs overdoses in Maine are on a record pace.I have outlined a plan to stop the opioid crisis. My plan begins with a strong border, includes the prosecution of drug dealers, and dramatically expands access to life-saving treatments that will help people unchain themselves from this terrible addiction.But, if we are going to bring hope back to suffering Americans, we must also solve our jobs crisis.At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.When I am President, everything will change. We will move people from the welfare rolls to the employment rolls. We will end our chronic trade deficits. We will start growing again.We'll rebuild our roads, schools, bridges, tunnels, railways, hospitals and airports.The state of Maine has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.Since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA.

Our biggest reductions will be for the working and middle class – this includes letting parents deduct the cost of childcare.Reagan's tax cuts in the eighties, and Kennedy's tax cuts in the sixties, brought us tremendous growth. My economic reforms – on taxes, trade, regulation and American energy – will produce at least 25 million newjobs in a decade. It's the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.We are also going to protect the right of the people of Maine to use their own land.President Obama, with the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton, issued an executive order 2 months ago making over 87,000 acres in Maine into a new ""National Monument."" No consideration was made for local concerns, impacts to jobs, or the Maine forestry sector. No approval by Congress. Your state legislature opposed it. It is just another federal overreach that is going to do more harm than good. Obama and Clinton don't care that this area badly needs jobs and growth and that this decision -- done at the stroke of the pen without the support of the local community-- undermines the people that live and work here in Maine.But we are going to turn it all around. America's comeback begins on November 8th.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every worker who deserves a raise, and for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors.I'm going to fight for every patriotic citizen that Hillary Clinton slanders as deplorable and irredeemable – and I am going to be a President for all of our citizens.I am going to fight to bring us together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.

"137",2016-10-17,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the KI Convention Center in Green Bay, Wisconsin","Thank you.In 22 days, we are going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win the White House.Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your absentee ballots.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Wisconsin under a Trump Administration.We are also going to end government corruption.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for President.Newly-released FBI documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The under-Secretary of State, Patrick Kennedy, pressured the FBI to un-classify emails from Hillary's illegal server. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover-up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classification.This is a criminal conspiracy – a conspiracy that included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 emails, the disappearance of 13 phones, 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI.Remember, also, that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever, and pretended not to know that the letter ""C"" meant confidential information that was classified. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times, and then, in written testimony last week under oath, said she couldn't remember another 21 times.We are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the Clinton's personal profit at your expense.But it gets even worse.The FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a ""quid pro quo."" This is felony corruption. Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign.Clinton cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety, and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all.This is magnitudes worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th.But there's still more. Another series of emails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists. One of the emails from a top Hillary official said, quote, ""take the money!!"" with two exclamation points. This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments.Remember, we are competing in a rigged election – the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news, only to poison the minds of the American voters. The media is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, as WikiLeaks proved – Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate.A new report from the Center for Public Integrity shows that 96% of so-called journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to Hillary Clinton. They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common.The following comes straight from Pew Research.QUOTE: ""Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate.""QUOTE: ""More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters.""QUOTE: ""Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.""Then there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting. The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post. The article was entitled: ""could non-citizens decide the November election?"" Here are some excerpts.QUOTE: ""More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote.""QUOTE: ""Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections. Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin.""Our system is also rigged by the donors, giving hundreds of millions to Hillary Clinton's campaign.The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and for completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move.If we let the Clinton Cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence.We will not let that happen.It is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.When Bill Clinton came into office, he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency, you can't lobby the government for 5 years after you leave. But then, President Clinton did what the Clintons always do – he rigged the system on his way out. Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash.So, here is what I am announcing tonight. First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service. I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order.Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.And Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.At the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.It's the Clintons who gave us NAFTA, and the Clintons who gave us China's entry into the World Trade Organization.Briggs & Stratton has cut thousands of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to China.GE Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to Mexico.Johnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and China.The list goes on and on.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National Security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally ""open trade and open borders.""By ""open trade,"" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By ""open borders,"" she means totally unlimited immigration.In a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said citizens who want to control immigration are ""Un-American.""So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers supporting Bernie Sanders.Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.So let me state this as clearly as I can.

"138",2016-10-18,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Norris-Penrose Event Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado","In 21 days, we are going to win the state of Colorado and we're going to win the White House. We're going to take it back. [applause]And while I'm at it, make sure you mail in those ballots before election day. Early voting starts on the 24th, you've got to mail them in. But get there, November 8th. I'd like to also start today by recognizing the incredible military contributions of Colorado Springs, a place I actually know very well. One of the most beautiful places, by the way. We have such amazing people working at Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base, the United States Space Command, NORAD, Schriever Air Force Base and the United States Air Force Academy. Good place. [applause]I've got many friends that went to the Air Force Academy, all very smart. They love their airplanes, that I can tell you. The courage and selflessness of our service members and their devotion to each other and to their country are the traits that we need to make America great again. [applause]Great people. Together, we're going to deliver real change that puts America first. You don't hear that term very much. We don't hear that term very much anymore, do we? America first, right? If I win, it's going to be America first every single time, that I can tell you. Believe me. [applause]We're going to end the government corruption and we're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. [applause]We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees from other countries, reduce surging crime, cut taxes big league and end regulations. [applause]Unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our great military, which sadly has become very depleted, but the greatest people on Earth. We're going to take care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. And repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. [applause]Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. Your taxes will go down under a Trump administration. [applause]Your country and I tell you, your country is so proud of you, but right now we have to help our country. We have to help our country. It is under siege in so many ways. By the way, you could almost stay, especially from the dishonest media, that's for sure. [applause]Very dishonest. Your companies won't be leaving Colorado under a Trump administration. They'll be expanding and there will be new companies coming in. Right now, we're not growing at all as a nation. You look at our jobs report, a disaster. Last week a jobs report, total disaster. Look at our GNP, total disaster. Under my plan, we're going to grow at 4 percent. Right now, we're at about 1 percent. [applause]China's at 7 percent. India's at 8 percent. We're at 1 percent and it's going to be going down if we keep if Hillary Clinton gets in, you will set record lows, believe me. That I can tell you. [applause]We're going to create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years. And by the way, did you see the protesters yesterday, where they call them. The protesters are paid a lot of money by the DNC. And I kept saying, I wonder why those people are here? Because they never seem to have much on their mind, other than stand up and protest. And yesterday it came out, but it was barely covered by the media. But it's all over the media. They were busted. They were paid $1,500 each and were given cell phones go up and disturb Trump rallies. And I sort of always knew it, in Chicago, even last night. We had people stand up for no reason. It's like, what are they doing here? And can you imagine, that's a big story, hardly covered by the media. [applause]So bad. We're also going to create a new government that answers to the people. Hillary Clinton—Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency. [applause]She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency after what she's done. I'll tell you. It's true. Newly released, two days ago, FBI documents reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The undersecretary of state, Patrick Kennedy, illegally pressured the FBI to unclassify e-mails from Hillary Clinton's illegal server. [applause]It's hard to believe. And nothing happens to her, folks, and nothing ever happens. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access. [applause]The FBI document show that Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a very, very serious quid pro quo. Not allowed to do it. This is a felony corruption. Yesterday, I said Undersecretary Kennedy must immediately resign. [applause]The media barely covers this event, by the way. [applause]This is a bigger event than Watergate and they practically refuse to cover it. Today, I'm calling for him to be fired. [applause]Clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all to her. [applause]Remember also that Hillary lied under oath to Congress, saying that she never sent or received classified information on her secret server. Right? She never received it on that insecure server, that she should have never been allowed to have. That you're not allowed to have. And pretended not to know. Remember this one: that the letter ""C"" meant confidential information was classified. [applause]She thought it was the lettering of a paragraph. [applause]There's never been a time in our country's history where anything like this has gone on. And the FBI, there must be people in there, based on what you read, that are ashamed of what's happened. And the Department of Justice, there must be people in there that are ashamed, absolutely ashamed of what's been going on. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times. And then in written testimony last week, under oath, she said that she couldn't remember another 21 times. Bad memory. She's got a terrible memory. [applause]This elaborate, criminal cover up included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 e-mails. The disappearance of 13 iPhones, some by hammers, two boxes of e-mail evidence gone missing, that was as of last week. Can you imagine they're now missing on top of everything else, two boxes of e-mails? And the destruction of laptops, in a secret deal with the FBI. [applause]This truly is, and I said it, this truly is many times worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th. [applause]Going to do it. [applause]Another series of leaked e-mails show top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from registered foreign lobbyists. And then you wonder why we do so badly. But you don't hear the media talking about that at all, do you? You don't see it at all. As WikiLeaks proved, the media, is merely, and it truly is, it's just an extension of the Clinton campaign. [applause]The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters. They have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories. Most recently about phony allegations where I have been under constant attack. They attack my business. I built a great business but, although most people do admit that. They attacked my wonderful family. They attacked my temperament. But I built an incredible company, those papers are filed. And I'm fortunate to have a beautiful and loving family. You all saw Melania last night on television. Did a great job. [applause]That she even has to do that is a shame. And my temperament has always been just about my greatest strength. We have a winning temperament. Our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win anymore. This is an election about truth. And you're not going to get it from the dishonest media. Some people can't handle the truth. No matter what people may think of me, the one thing they know is that we're going to tell the American people where we stand, where we are. We're going to tell them the truth. [applause]Now even though we're doing pretty good in the polls, I don't believe the polls anymore. I don't believe them. I don't believe them. And if there's 10, and if there's one or two bad ones, that's the only one they show. Believe me, folks, we're doing great. If we keep our spirit, and if we go out and win, this is another Brexit, believe me. They are so worried. That's why they've become vicious and hostile and dirty because they see what's going on. This rally set up just a short while ago; look at the number of people, packed. But every rally is the same way. [applause]At her rallies, very few people show up, when she has the energy to go to the event. Which isn't often. She's doing debate prep. She did so much debate prep. Did we beat her badly in that second debate? [applause]Sort of funny. She's been doing this for 30 years. Now she has to do debate prep for five days. You know what the debate prep is? It's resting. It's lying down, going to sleep. I think the media's trying to discourage our people from going out to vote. And it was just brought up to me by a reporter in the back. They said, you know, it's very interesting, when you were fighting 17 people, the media was nasty, but they really got nasty when we started to take the lead in the polls. They said, ""Wait a minute, this thing's going to happen. It's going to happen."" Change stop our jobs from leaving, our companies from leaving, strengthen our military, preserve our Second Amendment. They're saying, this is going to happen. And it is true. Made up stories. They're liars and made up stories. Without the media and all of the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way, she would be nothing. She would be nothing. She really—she would be doing so badly. Even my worst critics agree that the media has come after us like they have never come after anyone before. It's my badge of honor. I mean, you know, what am I going to do? Even the New York Times, which is totally dishonest, by the way—here's the good news about the New York Times. They won't be in business much longer. Do you see what they're losing? [applause]They are dying. They are dying. And they're dying also because they're very dishonest. But one of their biggest columnist-reporters wrote a story about how bad it is. He said, let's face it—this is in the New York Times ""balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto this golden Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy."" Can you believe that? They're admitting it. They don't even care. It actually said that we don't care. They will do anything to stop what we're doing. Not me, it's what we're doing. It's an agenda. It's going to agenda of change. But we won't let them stop maybe the greatest movement in the history of our country. History is watching us now, waiting to see if we will rise to the moment. We have to rise. We have to do it. We're under tremendous opposition. We have the greatest people in the world. That's what I've learned. Somebody said, what's the most important thing you learned? How great the American people are. I've gone all over the country. I have two things I've learned that, and I've learned how totally dishonest the media is. It's so dishonest. I've learned that, too. They are the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with. Not all of them, but, honestly, like 75 percent. Some are very good, but for the most part, yes. We have stories that we think are going to unbelievable stories. They turn out—they make them as bad as possible. We have stories on the other side that would normally dismantle a campaign, and they don't even report them. It's a disgrace. What's going on is a disgrace. But we've only just begun to fight, believe me. We have three weeks. You know what, we have three weeks. And I hear we're going great in Colorado. My people in back said, ""You're going to win Colorado, doesn't matter what they say."" [applause]Get out and vote. But they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt. And you see that. And voter fraud is all too common. And then they criticize us for saying that. And we have even Republicans, ""Oh, that's such a terrible thing to say."" Well, take a look at Philadelphia, what's been going on. Take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at some of these cities where you see things happening that are horrendous. And if you talk about them, they say bad things about you. They call you a racist. They call you all—and by the way, speaking of that, nobody will do more for the African-American citizens of this country than Donald Trump, nobody, nobody. Nobody will do more for the Latino community than Donald Trump, I can tell you.In 2014, the Washington Post, another beauty, published an article entitled, ""Could Non-Citizens Decide the November Election?"" The article found that 14 percent of non-citizens were registered to vote, 14 percent were registered to vote. And we're not supposed to talk about it. And your Republican leaders said, ""Oh, this—everything is peachy-dory,"" right? And it also found non-citizen voting may have given Democrats the pivotal sixtieth vote needed to pass Obamacare. It's a Washington policy, not me. The system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Crooked Hillary's campaign. It's rigged. It's a bad system. The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA—or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will also be a disaster—NAFTA's the worst trade deal ever signed, ever made, by anybody in the world. We're a one-way highway out. We get the drugs, right? We get the drugs. We get the unemployment. We get the empty factories. Mexico and other countries get the cash. They get the employment. They get the plants. And for completely open borders—she wants completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move. If we let Crooked Hillary's cartel and—and just remember this—run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year that America lost, truly lost, its independence, truly lost its independence. And by the way, this is our final shot, folks. In four years, it's over. You're never going to be able to win. You're never going to be able to win. It's tilting. It's going to be a one-party system. This is your final shot for the Supreme Court, for your Second Amendment. I mean, this is your final shot, November 8th. So hopefully you'll do what you know you have to do. Get out of bed and vote. No matter how you're feeling, no matter how you're feeling.It is indeed time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. This is why I'm proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. First, I'm going to institute a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service, right? Second, I'm going to ask Congress to institute its own five-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs. That's a simple one. And they know this should be done, but they're not going to do it, but they'll do it if I get in. I'm going to, number three, expand the definition of lobbyists so that we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves [applause]Right? I've been talking about that for years. Decades of failure in Washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end. And remember, by the time this ends, I will have spent over $100 million on my campaign. Hillary's spent nothing. She gets all her money from the special interest donors. And my interest is you; my interest is you. [applause]We have to break the cycle of corruption, and we have to give new voices to change. And we have to—we have no—do we have a choice? So that we can have a government that works again and can function properly, which our government doesn't right now, including giving Iran $1.7 billion in cash. [booing]And remember the deportation of 800 people? Turned out to be 800 people, then went to 1,800 people.And they were going to be deported for good reason. You know, if our country deports somebody, they've got to be pretty, pretty out there. Well, they pressed the wrong button, and congratulations, we have 1,800 new citizens of the United States. And when I said, ""undo it,"" they said that wouldn't be constitutional. Hey, folks, how stupid are we being led? The time for congressional term limits has finally arrived. Not only will it end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation that we're in right now. No growth. My plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. It will happen. [applause]At the center of our historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, which I've wanted to do from the beginning; 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are living right now on food stamps. It's hard to believe this is our country. We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world. And the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Do you know that? The worst since the Great Depression. Colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and a deal supported by Hillary Clinton very strongly. And this I thought was a typographical error, because I figured they meant 700 or 7,000, but it wasn't: We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. We are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world. More jobs have been stolen from our country, so stupidly we let them go. We let our companies go so foolishly. We don't know what we're doing. A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to the foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country, and have jobs come back in the other direction. [applause]As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. [applause]We are right now the highest-taxed nation in the world. That's one of the reasons our companies are leaving. We're also going to fix our inner cities—45 percent of African-American children, under the age of six are living in poverty; 58 percent of African-American youth are not working. Almost 3,500 people have been shot in the city of Chicago. Can you believe this? Since January 1st. The national murder rate has experienced the largest single year increase in more than 45 years. Can you believe that? Murder, highest rate in 45 years. So you don't—they don't seem to. She said, ""nobody cares."" And you're right, they don't seem too. So to those African-Americans suffering, to those Latinos suffering, I say: What do you have to lose? Elect Donald Trump. I will fix it. We will fix it. [applause]We will fix it. We're going to get a very big African-American vote. We're going to get a very big Latino vote. Because the Democrats come in, they want your vote. And as soon as you give them the vote, they say, ""See you in four years."" They don't do anything. It's gotten worse and worse for both the African-Americans, the Latino-Hispanics. It's gotten worse and it will only get worse. They want your vote. Hillary Clinton said she was going to fix up the state of New York when she ran for the Senate. It is a total disaster. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. [applause]Our national security begins at the border. Speaking in secret, to a foreign bank [applause]I promise, we will build the wall. [applause]Hillary Clinton said her dream is for total open trade. There go your jobs; and open borders—there goes your country. Simple as that.There are already a record 65 million people in the United States who speak a language other than English. It's in their interest and everyone's interest to control immigration so past arrivals can integrate into society and really join the middle class and the upper class. But in a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said, ""Citizens who want to control immigration are un-American."" In other words, if you want to have a border, you want to have a wall, which creates a country. Even if you want people to come in, but come in through a legal process, she considers that un-American. So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers in the case of the Bernie Sanders people. She said they were basement dwellers. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores. We will be the great Trojan horse folks. As sure as you're standing there. Just today, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS. He entered as a refugee in November of 2009. And then we approved for a green card in 2011. It's one of hundreds of examples of the United States voluntarily admitting people from the world's most dangerous places who turn out to be terrorists. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. We have enough problems. [applause]We have enough problems. We've got big problems: $20 trillion in debt. We have problems like you wouldn't believe. We'll also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders. And we will build that wall and Mexico will pay for that wall. [applause]We just got the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol Office. First time they've ever done it. ICE was just last week. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries would not take them back. They were too evil. They were too evil drug lords, heads of gangs. I mean these people were evil. They wouldn't take them back. So we come over, we bring, they won't take them back. Oh, take them back, drop them on the streets. And then you wonder why the murder rate is the highest in 45 years and other things. The ICE officer described Hillary's proposal as quote, ""The most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history."" Here's a summary of the Hillary plan. She wants to support sanctuary cities. She wants Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens. They get taken care of better than our great vets. That won't happen. She wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants. Obamacare is not going to be here much longer, folks. You see what's going on. Regardless. No deportation of Visa overstays. Expanding catch-and-release on the border. She wants it expanded. In other words, catch them and say, ""Oh, you can go."" Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers. Freeing even—there go your jobs—freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives. And this is to me, the beauty of them all. Obama has allowed thousands and thousands and thousands of people to come in, Syrians from the Middle East. She wants an increase of 550 percent in Syrian refugees into our country. [booing]Either we win this election, or we lose our country. Under a Trump administration, it's going to be America first. [applause]Here are some of the amazing things we're going to do for our country starting in 2017. We're so close. We have to get it over the line. We're so close. Forget the press. Read the internet, study other things, don't go for the mainstream media. Most of them—good news—fortunately most of them won't be around very much longer, in my opinion. They're going down. Financially, big trouble. A lot of big trouble. They've got a lot of big trouble. That's good. We're going to have—and I do get a lot of honesty over the internet. You do get some dishonesty, too, but at least you can separate it. We should have a choice. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe even bigger. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We are going to defend religious liberty, provide school choice to every low- income child in America. And get rid of common core so that we can have education locally. [applause]We are going to support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]Law and order and justice. Law and order and justice. We are going to save something that is under tremendous stress. We're going to save your Second Amendment. [applause]And we're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]You have 21 days to make every dream you've ever dreamed for you family, for your grandchildren, for you children, for yourself, for your country to come true. Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. There's a lot of love in this room. A lot of love. And we don't want a divided country. We want to bring other people. We want to love everybody in our country. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and the elitism of our failed political establishment. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. That's you, and you. I am going to fight so hard for every citizen, of every background, for every single stretch of this nation. I am going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence, and the viciousness that it all builds. I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have turned into dust. And those jobs and factories are not with us any more. They're in other countries, making everybody rich but us. [applause]I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests. [applause]And with all the money she made, she doesn't put up any money into her own campaign. That's pretty remarkable. I'm doing it. I'm going to fight to bring us all together. We're not going to be divided anymore as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause]Thank you. In 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, you're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this beautiful day in this great state and in this truly great country. This is a movement that they have never seen before. They've never seen anything like this before. There has never been like this before. You're going to look back at this election and say, ""This is by far the most important vote, you've ever cast, for anyone at any time."" [applause]Once again, we're going to have a government of, by, and for the people. [applause]You will see, and be so proud of your country again and hopefully you'll be so proud of your president again. [applause]We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.Thank you, everybody. God bless you. November 8th, go out and vote. November 8th. God bless you, everybody. [applause]","UCSB"
"139",2016-10-20,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Delaware County Fairgrounds in Delaware, Ohio","Thank you.In 19 days, we are going to win the state of Ohio and we are going to win the White House.Early voting is underway, so make sure to mail in your ballot or vote in-person.Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic Presidential election – if I win!ALTERNATE:Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept – without delay or hesitation – the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton.Now, seriously, the debate last night was amazing and everybody said I won, including every single online poll, some by 90-10.The question of voter fraud came up during the debate. We want fairness in the election, having nothing to do with me and having to do with the future of the country.John Podesta, Hillary's Campaign Chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks, as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have Drivers' Licenses.One of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton Campaign has paid people to disrupt our rallies and incite violence. This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition on peaceful, Democratic elections.A campaign like Clinton's that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything.And a candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who will lie to the Congress and the FBI, destroy 33,000 emails, put her office up for sale, and put our confidential information in reach of our enemies – is a candidate who is truly capable of anything.In addition, it was just learned, Hillary was given the exact debate questions, word for word, by Donna Brazile – who is now under tremendous pressure to resign. But I ask you, why shouldn't Hillary Clinton resign from the race – she was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate?Years ago there was a show called the $64,000 question – he got the questions in advance, his life was ruined. This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.So it's in that context I was asked a question about whether I would agree, in advance, to concede the results on election night. This is an unprecedented question. If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed 3 weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case and no Bush V. Gore.In effect, I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the franchise of voters.According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.1.8 million dead people are registered to vote (some of whom vote even though they are dead – which is a hard thing to do, but easy if fraud is involved).2.8 million people are registered in more than one state.And 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote.So what I'm saying is, we have to be vigilant and we have to be careful.America is a Constitutional Republic with a system of laws. These laws are triggered in the case of fraud, or in the event a recount is needed.Of course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all the candidates who came before me.But, none of this will matter, since we are going to win big on November 8th.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Ohio under a Trump Administration.Right now, our economy isn't growing at all. I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.Companies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico. When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back in. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.Right now, our politicians don't do anything to keep our companies from leaving because they are controlled by lobbyists and special interests – Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.It's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.Those reforms include the following:A 5 year-ban on executive branch and congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.A lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.A ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.Additionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.It's about time.Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.At the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.Ohio has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – two Bill and Hillary-backed disasters.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.I also have another major announcement I am going to make today that concerns manufacturing in the United States, and how we are going to bring jobs back to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and all across this great nation.American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.In my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated in one Office. It will report to an American Desk and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.It's going to be America First.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.And it's getting worse.To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National Security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally ""open trade and open borders.""Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.Just last week, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS.So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.There is another major policy announcement I would like to make today. Every year, countless American lives are lost to Sanctuary Cities. My opponent strongly supports Sanctuary Cities, like the ones that got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant.If I am elected President, I am going to cut off federal funding to Sanctuary Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.We are going to save American lives.Either we win this election, or we lose the country.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end common core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 19 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Ohio and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.Because if we win –We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.","UCSB"
"140",2016-10-21,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the WNC Agricultural Center's Davis Event Center in Fletcher, North Carolina","Thank you.In 18 days, we are going to win the state of North Carolina and we are going to win the White House.Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns -- raised from special interests -- and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your ballot.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration.

That's how our system is corrupt and broken.We're going to take on big donors, big business and big media that have enriched themselves at your expense.The media is so corrupt that Hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile – who is now under tremendous pressure to resign.Hillary was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate.Years ago there was a show called the $64,000 question – a contestant got the questions in advance, his life was ruined.This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.Now, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million from the King of Morocco for an appearance – more pay-for-play.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.Those reforms include the following:A 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service.A lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.Additionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: Jobs, Jobs, JobsAt the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.We are going to start making things in America again – and we are going to start making things in North Carolina again.In order to bring manufacturing back to North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and so many other places, we are going to undertake a major reform of our federal bureaucracy.American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.In my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated into one Office.

Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Pennsylvania under a Trump Administration.We are also going to rebuild our badly depleted military.Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I. My plan will build the 350 ship Navy we need. This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan, and it will require a truly national effort. The Philadelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example. I will instruct my Secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort.As our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsmen we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so much more.We will establish 'centers of excellence' in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our Fleet.We will rebuild our navy and we will do it with American steel made right here in Pennsylvania.As part of our plan for bold change to make your life better, we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure.Obama-Clinton doubled the national debt in 8 years – but instead of rebuilding America, the money was all lost and America's infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.We're also spending $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East, with nothing to show for it.Imagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of Philadelphia.Instead, we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our own to crumble. We defend other countries' borders, invest in their resources, but abandon our own. The plan I am proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix America's transportation, drinking water, and other vital infrastructure. This can be achieved through a focus on public-private partnerships, proven financing programs, and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job-and-wealth producing investments in the local economy.This means help for projects like the Pennsylvania Turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania portion of the Appalachian Highway System. My plan will also help Pennsylvania upgrade or replace bridges in the Commonwealth that have been deemed ""structurally deficient.""We are also going to unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania – shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.We are putting Pennsylvania back to work, and we are putting the special interests out of work.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stop the TPP, and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation.Your city has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States since China entered the World Trade Organization.Just a few miles from here, there's a very famous bridge that says: ""Trenton Makes, The World Takes.""Under a Trump Administration, I can promise you: we are going to start making things in America again – and we are going to start making things in Pennsylvania again.Your products will be sent around the world, not your jobs.Hillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries.She's the most corrupt person ever to run for President.She bleached and deleted 33,000 emails – after a Congressional subpoena – lied under oath to Congress, lied to the FBI, obstructed justice, made 13 phones disappear – some with a hammer – and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence have mysteriously gone missing.Now, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million dollars from the King of Morocco for an appearance – more pay-for-play.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.One new proposal I am outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business.I will work with Congress to require that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated.We're losing $2 trillion dollars in economic activity a year to regulations – the only people getting rich are the lobbyists, lawyers and special interests.I am also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.My plan lowers our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering.

"142",2016-10-22,"Donald Trump","Remarks on Proposals for the First 100 Days in Office at the Eisenhower Complex in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania","Thank you. [applause]Thank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you please sit down. Thank you.It's my privilege to be here in Gettysburg hallowed ground where so many lives were given in service to freedom. Amazing place. President Lincoln served at a time of division like we've never seen before. It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now. We are a very divided nation.I'm not a politician and have never wanted to be a politician, believe me. But, when I saw the trouble our country was in I knew I couldn't stand by and watch any longer. Our country has been so good to me. I love our country and I felt I had to act. [applause]I've seen the system up-close-and-personal for many years. I've been a major part of it. I know how the game works in Washington and on Wall Street and I know how they've rigged the rules of the game against everyday Americans. The rules are rigged. Nearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't even working. One in five households have no one with a job. 45 million Americans are on food stamps and 47 million are living in poverty.We have failed our inner cities and in so doing have failed our African-American and Hispanic communities.We've misguided military adventures overseas and wars that go on forever that just cannot be won by the people that are doing it now. They don't know how to win the wars at home. We have our great veterans dying while waiting for medical care. Change has to come from outside our very broken system. Our system is broken.The fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once-in-a-lifetime. [applause]The system is totally rigged and broken. First, the issue of voter fraud. According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly significantly inaccurate. And when I say that there are such inaccuracies, it's unbelievable. 1.8 million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting. I wonder how that happens. 2.8 million people are registered in more than one state is a number folks. These are numbers. Fourteen percent of non-citizens are registered to vote. The system is also rigged because Hillary Clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the United States. But, the FBI and the Justice Department covered up her crimes which included lying to the FBI and congress on numerous occasions and included saying I do not recall to the FBI on 39 separate times.She recalls everything else, but 39 separate times she said I do not recall. Well, that's a lies. Also, then there is the deletion of at least 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress that's after receiving the subpoena as an example. It was announced this week that the highly-respected four-star general James Cartwright, maybe sentenced to up to five years in prison with a massive fine for lying on one occasion to the FBI. He said he did that for national security reasons. Highly respected man. A four-star general. This took place two days ago. How must he feel. A big part of the rigging of this election is the fact that Hillary is being allowed to run despite having broken so many laws on so many different occasions.Why is she allowed to run? The dishonest, mainstream media is also part in a major part of this corruption. They're corrupt. They lie and fabricate stories to make a candidate that is not their preferred choice, look as bad and even dangerous as possible.At my rallies, they never show or talk about the massive crowd size and try to diminish all of our events. On the other hand, they don't show the small size of Hillary's crowds but in fact talk about how many people are there. Very small crowds. You know it. They know it. Over the last two days, three highly respected national polls said we're in first place and one of those pollsters was the most accurate pole on the last two cycles. But, the media refuses to even say it or put that word out. They refused to talk about it. They're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people as an example of the power structure and fighting. AT&T is buying Time Warner and the CNN. A deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.Likewise, Amazon, which through its ownership controls the Washington Post, should be paying massive taxes. It's not paying and it's a very unfair playing field and you see what that's happening and what that's doing to department stores all over the country.Very very unfair and you're talking about billions and billions of dollars. They should be paying those taxes.Additionally, Comcast purchase of NBC concentrates far too much power in one massive entity that is trying to tell the voters what to think and what to do. Deals like this destroy democracy and we'll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that. This should never ever have been approved in the first place. They're trying to poison the mind of the American voter. Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total Fabrication. The events never happened, never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over but a simple phone called placed to the biggest newspapers or television networks get them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever.Here is why this is relevant to you. If they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they can do to you. Your jobs. Your security. Your education. Your healthcare. The violation of religious liberty. The theft of your second amendment. The loss of your factories, your homes, and much more.Look at what they've done to you with your jobs. It is just been lined on video, that the violent protests at some of my rallies, like in Chicago, where police and others were seriously hurt. You saw that blood pouring down their face were caused by paid, paid DNC and Clinton campaign operatives.Now, we didn't know this. We didn't know, this just came out two days ago on tape. We didn't know this. We were amazed at the level of violence. These were paid operatives. Paid by the DNC and probably the Clinton campaign. This is a criminal act. Policemen were badly hurt and so were many others and these people prosecuted. But because of the rigged system they probably won't be. Just like we found out about these paid violent protesters, it was probably the DNC and the Clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories. But, we'll find out their involvement at a later date through litigation and I look so forward to doing.The rigging of the system is designed for one reason, to keep the corrupt establishment and special interests in power at your expense and everybody's expense.I have no special interest but you the American Vogel. [applause]I didn't have to do this, believe me. There's nothing easy about it but I had to do it. I love our country. I love the people of our country and I felt I had to do it. [applause]Thank you. One thing we all know is that we will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.Hillary Clinton is not running against me, she's running against change and she's running against all of the American people and all of the American voters. [applause]We now find ourselves at that very special fork in the road, do we repeat the mistakes of the past or do we choose to believe that a great future yet unwritten still lies ahead for us and for our wonderful beloved country. [applause]I think it does.I know it does. My economic plan will deliver at least 25 million jobs in one decade. Now, our jobs have been taken away. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to so many other countries. It's a one lane highway where they get the jobs, they get the factories, they get the money, and we get the drugs and we get the unemployment and it's going to change. Believe me it's going to change. [applause]And that goes for all countries. When you look at China, when you look at every trade deal we have, is horrible and we should be ashamed of a people and the people that let those deals happen.They're defective and they knew they were defective and they were done for a reason. And believe me they will be unwound so fast and we will have trade. We will have great trade and it'll be free trade but it'll be fair trade and it'll be real.My security plan, so important.They've taken the jobs from us. My security plan will bring safety to our poorest communities.My ethics plan will end corruption in our government. [applause] We will. Corruption is massive.We will drain the swamp in Washington DC and replace it with a new government of, by, and for the people. [applause]That is why I have chosen Gettysburg to unveil this contract. I'm asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character and there's nothing better or stronger than the American character. [applause]I am asking the American people to dream big once again.What follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It's a contract between Donald J Trump and the American voter – and begins with bringing honesty, accountability and change to Washington DC.Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: FIRST, a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. [applause]SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition exempting military, public safety, and public health. [applause]THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. Regulations are killing our country and our jobs. [applause]FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service, making a fortune. [applause]FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, very bad.[applause]SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections, that's what's happening. [applause]On the same day, I will begin taking and really taking strongly 7 actions to protect American workers. Our American workers have been treated so badly by politicians that don't have their interest at heart and we are going to change that. We're going to change that very very fast.FIRST, I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA one of the worst deals our country has ever made signed by Bill Clinton or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205. [applause]SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership a potential disaster for our country. [applause]THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. China is a currency manipulator. What they have done to us by playing currency is very sad and I don't blame them. They have been very smart. I blame our politicians for letting this take place. So easy to stop so easy to stand.FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. [applause]FIFTH, very importantly I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job producing American energy reserves, [applause] including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal and we will put our miners back to work.SIXTH, I will lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks that allow for this vital energy infrastructure projects to forward. We have roadblocks like you've never ever seen. Environmental blocks, structural blocks, we're going to allow the Keystone Pipeline and so many other things to move forward. Tremendous numbers of jobs and good for our country.SEVENTH, we are going to cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs [applause] and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure. We're paying billions and billions and billions of dollars. We're going to fix our own environment. [applause].Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law. We have to do that.FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia whose wife by the way has a Trump sign. His wife is a phenomenal woman. Has a Trump sign in her front yard, isn't that nice? I just found that out this morning. From one of the 20 judges on my list, you know we're going to make great decisions from twenty outstanding judges on a list that we submitted who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]THIRD, we will cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities. [applause] FOURTH, we will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country these are drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers, and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back [applause] and when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and they had someone who was bad, really bad and they brought him back to the country and the country wouldn't take him. She said we'll bring him back; we don't want to force the country to take him. There won't be one such instance if I become president. [applause]FIFTH, We're going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. [applause] And if you look at Syria and the migration, we're taking in thousands and thousands of people into our country. We have no idea who they are, what their thought process is, where they come from and Hillary Clinton wants to increase the number of those thousands and thousands currently pouring by 550%. Radical, Islamic terror is right around the corner. We have to be so tough, so smart, so vigilant. We can't allow that to happen [applause] we have enough problems. [applause] All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. We will be very careful.Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: 1. Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. [applause] We need that so badly. We need jobs. Our jobs have left us. Our good jobs have really left us.The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. [applause] Who have been forgotten. Called the forgotten man and woman. They have been forgotten. A middle-class family with 2 children will get basically a 35% tax cut. And that's what they can use and that money will go back into the economy. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. [applause]The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. It's stuck. We can't bring it back. Two and a half to five trillion dollars. Companies can't get it back into the country. Some companies are actually leaving not only because taxes are so high but because the can't get their money and they are actually leaving to get their money. We are going to simplify that. We're going to have them bring the money back into our country and use the money and spend the money on building our country. [applause] 2. The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. [applause] They leave the United Stated like carrier like forward like so many others. They leave the United States and fire all of their employees. They go to Mexico or another country. They build a beautiful brand new plant. They hire other people. They then take their air conditioners, their cars, whatever they're making. They send it tax free across what will be a very strong border believe me [applause] but they send it tax free across the border and what do we end with we have?We have unemployment, tremendous losses, and we have none of the benefits. So we will establish tariffs that when they do that there will be consequences. We will work with them; we will be nice we will be fair but there has to be consequences. And when they know their consequences our companies will stop leaving the United States and going to other countries.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. Our infrastructure is in such trouble. We've doubled our national debt to 20 trillion dollars under president Obama. In less than 8 years, 10 trillion dollars has been added. Think of it and we haven't fixed anything. We haven't fixed anything. What have we doe? Our roads are broken, our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools, and we have 20 trillion in debt. All-time high. That's true, our VA hospitals are in bad shape. VA is in very very bad shape and we will fix that. We are going to work on fixing that [applause] because our veterans are not treated properly. We have illegal immigrants that are treated far better in many instances than our veterans [applause] and we're not going to have that. It is revenue neutral. 4. School Choice and Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. [applause] And so importantly ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. We do so badly on education. If you look at the lists, you see Sweden, Norway, Denmark, different countries at the top. You see us at the bottom and yet by far, per-pupil, more money than anybody and it's not even close. We spend more money per-pupil than anybody not even close. We're at the bottom of the list. Other countries spending far less per-pupil are at the top of the list so obviously our current system is not working. We will change it and we will make it good. [applause] It expands vocational and technical education, which we've totally forgotten about in this country and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. Have you ever gone to school and you've been with people that aren't good students but they can fix an engine or they can build a wall or they can do things that you wouldn't even think about because we can use some of the one who build the wall [laughter] we're going to need them [laughter] we're going to need them but did you ever see that how they are genius at fixing a car? They can do anything, but history, not so good, physics, not so good, we have to open vocational again. [applause]Those are people those are great people.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. [applause] Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with Health Savings Accounts, so we can do that. The Health Savings Account, it's one way there are numerous ways but this one very good way. The ability to purchase health insurance across state lines. We have to do it because that's competition. The politicians won't let go of it because the insurance companies, they don't want competition but we'll open it up. Believe me we will get rid of it I've been saying it for years. And lets states manage Medicaid funds it will be so good. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Mean they are looking at drugs that are looking very good and you have terminal patients that it's over, these people are dying, they want to get the drug. They won't be living much longer and we study it for years and years and at some point they have to do what they have to do. They have to do it properly but we have 4,000 different drugs and products waiting in ling for approval and we can't get them approved. We are going to speed up that process very significantly6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and you see that with a couple of companies and it is such a great thing to see and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. [applause] so good7. End Illegal Immigration Act. [applause]Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border, don't worry about it. Remember I said Mexico's paying for the wall. With the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall. Ok. We are going to have the wall; Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Mexico's by the way I met with the President of Mexico 2 Ѕ months ago, wonderful meeting, wonderful person. But I told him this is a two-way highway not a one-way highway. We have our people. We have out take care of our people. Have to protect our people so it's got to be a two-way street otherwise it is going to be a whole different deal. But establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence, there are people coming in illegally, for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; so when somebody comes in, we send them out. They come back, they go to prison for quite a while. They come back, they come back again they go five years. Because what is happening is they are coming back ten times and I could go cases after case they come back.Look at what happened in San Francisco five times he came back on the fifth time he killed. Five times. But so many others 110 times came back, killed somebody after ten times. When they get deported they stay out otherwise they have very serious prison terms. They will stay out. Once you do that, they will stay out. Right now, they have no consequence. They have no consequence. Also reforms on visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. [applause]8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police who are doing such a great job, believe me. We increase the resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars [applause] or out of our country and into the country where they came from. [applause]9. Restoring National Security Act. Which rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester which has been very tough on military and expanding military investment.Now, at no time, practically, do we need a military like right now. We don't want to use it, but it is peace through strength. We need a strong military. [applause]Our military is so terribly depleted. It also provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice. If they're waiting on line and I have the plan up and we've gotten as you know tremendous support from veterans, from law enforcement, from veterans, from the military tremendous support. But if they're waiting in line and you see it 22 suicides a day, people don't even believe it, but 22 suicides a day. But if they're waiting in line 47 days, 6 days, 9 days, they can't get to see a doctor and a simple procedure or a simple prescription can solve their problem and they become very sick and they die, they die waiting in line. We're going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor, a private doctor, a public hospital, or private hospital, all looking to help and all looking to do business. And we will pay the bill. So much cheaper but much more importantly the veterans will finally be taken care of properly because what they are going through now is unacceptable. [applause]Also, we are going to protect our vital infrastructure from the new thing, cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values [applause] we want people that love our country or can love our country and people that will love our citizens. [applause] We want people that can love us and there are ways through talent of determining that and other countries do but we don't. Just come on in folks. Just come on in.10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts tough new ethics reforms to reduce the corrupting influence of special interests and donors on our politics.On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. [applause]And importantly we will Make America Great Again.Believe me.","UCSB"
"143",2016-10-23,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Collier County Fairgrounds in Naples, Florida","Thank you.It's great to be back here in beautiful Naples.In 16 days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win the White House.Early voting begins tomorrow, and you can already get your absentee ballot, so make sure to start voting.Yesterday, I outlined my Contract with the American Voter – a detailed list of solutions to bring prosperity to our economy, safety to our communities, and honesty to our government.One of the issues I addressed at length is the issue of government corruption. I put forward a plan to stop it; my opponent has no plan to end government corruption because she is the embodiment of government corruption. Even as she was preparing to run for President, WikiLeaks emails show, Hillary was trying to get $12 million from the King of Morocco in yet one more Pay-For-Play scheme.My goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics. Hillary Clinton's goal is to put the Oval Office up for sale to whatever country offers the highest price.So I have a message today to the voters of America. It's a message for Republicans, Democrats and Independents. It's a message for those living in rural America, urban America and suburban America – because we are all just One America.It's a message for everyone who wants to take back our government from the special interests.And my message is this: if we win on November 8th, we are going to fix our rigged system and we are going to Drain The Swamp Of Corruption In Washington, D.C.That change includes a new foreign policy that puts America First.Hillary Clinton's foreign policy has squandered trillions in American wealth overseas. Yet, for all the money spent, all Clinton delivered was death, destruction and terrorism. She unleashed ISIS and turmoil in Iraq, Syria and Libya.Next, trigger-happy Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria that could involve nuclear-armed Russia – she has bad judgment, bad instincts, and is just too reckless to be allowed into the Oval Office.Hillary also started the negotiations that led to the Iran deal – and thus ultimately leading to the $1.7 billion ransom for American hostages.Clinton gave Iran everything they wanted and more – including Iraq. Now, Iran is emboldened as never before.In the latest insult to America, the government of Iran is demanding ""many billions,"" in new ransom payments for an American businessman and his ailing father. Adding to the insult, Iran has released a video of their captive that includes footage from earlier this year of American soldiers being forced to their knees at gunpoint.The humiliation for our country never seems to end – and it's the humiliation brought on by a Secretary of State who was more interested in getting paid by foreign countries, than in representing the country she lives in.To cover-up her crimes as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phones disappear – some with a hammer – and then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times.The best evidence that the system is rigged is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for President in the first place.The Clintons grew their gross income by $60 million while Hillary was Secretary of State. She's not a diplomat – she's a grifter, always looking for an easy way to sell government favors and access in exchange for cash.The Clintons end up with the money, and America ends up with the humiliation.When I am President, America will be respected in the world once again.That also means standing up against the oppression of the Castro regime in Cuba, and standing in solidarity with freedom-loving people in Venezuela and across Latin America living under oppression. The Obama-Clinton Administration has abandoned our friends in Latin America, and delivered only poverty and joblessness for Hispanic-Americans here at home.If you elect me, along with a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. It's part of my 100-day plan.This will be a national effort that will involve everywhere from Key West to Tampa to the Space Coast to Jacksonville to the Panhandle.My proposal is based on three crucial words: Peace Through Strength.This defense build-up will be supported by ships in Mayport, and by engineers and advanced manufacturing on the Space Coast. New aircraft will fly from MacDill Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola.New Navy and Coast Guard ships will patrol the Florida coast to prevent drugs and terrorists from entering our shores.With a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is ""the craziest thing in the world,"" where ""people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.""Replacing Obamacare is part of my 100-day contract with the American Voter.A Republican House and Senate can swiftly enact the other items in my contract immediately, including massive tax reduction and tax simplification for the middle class. My plan to transform our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies is the most pro-growth plan in American history. It includes lowering our business tax from 35 to 15 percent. My reform plan will lift millions out of poverty, raise wages dramatically, and create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years – and we can enact the whole plan in our first 100 days.A Trump Administration will also work alongside you to restore and protect the beautiful Florida Everglades. Our plan will also help you upgrade water and wastewater systems so that the Florida Aquifer is pure and safe from pollution.We will also repair the Herbert Hoover Dike in Lake Okeechobee.My contract includes something else at the very center of this campaign: fixing our trade deals and ending the offshoring of American jobs.One more way our system is rigged against the American Worker is that companies, like Carrier, simply fire their workers and move their operations to Mexico and other countries. When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for other countries, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States.We have a nearly $800 billion-dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world. 1 in 5 American households don't have a single person in that household with a job.Florida has lost 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving our country.We will start making things in America.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.Immigration security is national security.Hillary's pledge for ""open borders"" includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within your communities and near your families.A new WikiLeaks email shows John Podesta secretly worried about the fact that Hillary Clinton never put procedures in place to keep the San Bernardino shooter out of America – including a plan to review social media postings. We're letting in Radical Islamic Terrorists right through the front door, and stamping their visas ""approved"" on the way in.So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.All across our nation, innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrant criminals who should never have been in our country.Kate Steinle was gunned down in her father's arms in broad daylight on a San Francisco pier. Her killer had been deported 5 times before.90 year-old Earl Olander was brutally beaten to death in his home by illegal immigrants with criminal records and left on the floor of his home to die.Laura Wilkerson's teenage son, Josh, was tortured and beaten to do by an illegal immigrant he offered to give a ride home. His body was viciously burned.The examples go on and on and on.Under a Trump Administration, this crime wave will come crashing to an end.That includes the proposal, in my contract, for tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country after a previous deportation.With a victory in November, everything will change.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 16 days to make this all happen – but you have to get out and vote, and that includes helping me elect a Republican Congress to enact my 100-day America-First action plan.Our failed establishment will be replaced with a new government guided by the principles I outlined in my contract with the American Voter.It will be a government of, by and for the people.For those who feel like they don't have a voice, I have a simple reply: I Am Your Voice.I'm going to fight for every American in every last part of this nation.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. This is a movement like the world has never seen before.You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time. We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.","UCSB"
"144",2016-10-26,"Donald Trump","Remarks at McGlohon Theatre at Spirit Square in Charlotte, North Carolina","It is great to be here in Charlotte to discuss an issue that means so much to me.That is the issue of urban renewal, and the rebuilding of our inner cities.Today I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class, and to provide a new deal for Black America. That deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education, and high-paying jobs.My vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign: America First.Every African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first.I'm asking today for the honor of your vote, and the privilege to represent you as your President. Here is the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. I have no special interest, I take no orders from donors or lobbyists – I work for you, and only you.Our campaign is about change, optimism, and the future. I am asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past, and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future.Our opponent represents the rigged system and failed thinking of yesterday. Her campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets, that nothing can ever really change.Hillary has been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything – she's just made it worse.American politics is caught in a time loop – we keep electing the same people, who keep making the same mistakes, and who keep offering the same excuses.The fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement is just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime.Every day I'm out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking. And every day, the same people, getting rich off our broken system, tell us that we can't change and that we can't try anything new.I have a message for all the doubters in Washington: America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics.And it's time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country.African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation. They have fought and died in every war since the Revolution, and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for Civil Rights.Yet, too many African-Americans have been left behind.45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.58% of African-American youth are not currently employed.African-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population, yet make-up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22.In 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent – and it's expected to rise 24% in 2016.In the city of Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since January of this year.The conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable.The Democrats have run our inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years or more. They've run the school boards, the city councils, the mayor's offices, and the congressional seats. Their policies have failed, and they've failed miserably.They've trapped children in failing government schools, and opposed school choice at every turn.The Clintons gave us NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, two deals that de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry, and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina. This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA, decimating the African-American middle class.Democratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violence.Then there is the issue of taxation and regulation. Massive taxes, massive regulation of small business, and radical restrictions on American energy, have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities. Hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent – which will only drive more jobs out of your community, and into other countries.One of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration. Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans. No group has been more economically-harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers. Hillary's pledge to enact ""open borders,"" – made in secret to a foreign bank – would destroy the African-American middle class.At the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade. Massive, chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs. Just look at what has happened to Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and right here in North Carolina. It's the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.If I'm President, and the executives at Ford Motor Company announce they are moving their plants and jobs to Mexico, I will pick up the phone and make a simple call. I will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico, I will put a 35% tax on their product before they ship it back into the United States. We won't let your jobs be stolen from you anymore. When we stop the offshoring to low-wage countries, we raise wages at home – meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable.At the same time, my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores. It also includes a massive middle class tax cut, tax-free childcare savings accounts, and childcare tax deductions and credits.I will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment, and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement.I will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African-Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities. Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need. The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession – through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie. It's time for a 21st century Glass Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need.We will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgive-able micro-loans.Then there is the issue of public safety. Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump Administration.I have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system, and I promise that under a Trump Administration the law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be only one set of rules – not a two-tiered system of justice. The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, lie to Congress and the FBI – put our national security at grave risk – and not even face so much as a fine.Equal justice also means the same rules for Wall Street. The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable.We will also police our streets. I want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace. Safety is a civil right. The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods. The reduction of crime is not merely a goal – but a necessity. We will get it done. The war on police urged on by my rival is reckless, and dangerous, and puts African-American lives at risk. We must work with our police, not against them.On immigration, my policy is simple. I will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration. I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. A portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws, and suspending refugees, will be re-invested in our inner cities. It is time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country.Infrastructure will be another major goal. My contract calls for $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary.I will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations. These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years, and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities.School choice is at the center of my plan. My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time, and I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states. I will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job. My plan will also ensure funding for Historical Black Colleges and Universities, more affordable 2 and 4-year college, and support for trade and vocational education.Finally, today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty, the promotion of family, and support for the African-American church.This is just the beginning. Because I will never, ever take the African-American community for granted. It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow. The cycle of poverty can be broken, and great new things can happen for our people.But to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites in Washington who've been wrong about virtually everything for decades.The people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA, and opening our markets to China, would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation. Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache.The people opposing us are the same people who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering – imagine if that money had been spent at home.My opponent unleashed ISIS on the world. She tried to build Democracy in Libya, and failed. She tried to build Democracy in Iraq, and failed. She tried regime change in Egypt, and failed. She pressed regime change in Syria, and failed. She tried a Russian Reset that failed. She tried an Asia Pivot that failed. Now, Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could lead us into World War III.Finally, our opponents passed a healthcare law, embraced by Hillary Clinton, over the furious objections of the American voter. Obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system – premiums are skyrocketing double-digits and are surging by more than 100% in the great state of Arizona. Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing. Every prediction they made about this law was a lie. If we don't repeal and replace this disastrous law, we will lose our healthcare system forever.Now is the time to embrace a New Direction.I've been very lucky and have led a great life. Now I want to give back to the country which has been so good to me. I just left a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., delivered under budget, and ahead of schedule, creating thousands of jobs, including construction. It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world, and a great symbol for our country. I took two hours to fly into Washington, to cut the ribbon with my children, and then jump on the plane to be here with you. I wanted to be there for my children, who worked so hard on this hotel -- parents must stick with, encourage, and support their children. They did a great job on the hotel, and I told them so. Likewise, the workers did a magnificent job -- without them, it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully. The rebuilding we did of the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country.I want to go into the inner cities, the poor rural communities, and the failing schools, and I want to work on a national plan for revitalization. I'm tired of the excuses from our politicians. I'm tired of being told what can't be done. I'm tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams to another day, but really another decade.Enough waiting. The time is now. There is nothing we can't accomplish. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside our reach.Everywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free. But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again. We have to choose the more optimistic path – we have to choose to believe not in our politicians, but to believe in ourselves and in our country. If we do that, anything is possible.I'm asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. Let's close the history books on the failures in Washington, and let's open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone.I am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the Party of Abraham Lincoln. And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home of the African-American vote once again.Together, we will have a government of, by and for the people.And we will Make America Great Again For All Americans.","UCSB"

They detach. Our society becomes unplugged and unhinged.When the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then the laws lose their moral authority.Hillary believes money and power – not truth and justice – should rule the day.As FDR once said, government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.This is what we often see in Third World countries – where the governments are often run by a small handful of corrupt people for their personal enrichment.Corruption is corrosive to every institution of government, and it must be stopped.Restoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.We must save the America.That is why My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take our country back from the special interests.I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I am about to say.When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C.

"148",2016-10-29,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Arizona","The silent majority is back. In 10 days, we are going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win back the White House.A Trump Administration will immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.It's just been announced that the citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums. Elect me, and WE WILL STOP THE PREMIUM HIKES FOR GOOD. WE WILL STOP THE MADNESS OF OBAMACARE.Every single one of Arizona's 15 counties is losing insurers next year because of Obamacare. In Phoenix, there are 8 Obamacare insurers this year. Next year there will be only one. And it was announced this week that Obamacare premiums in Phoenix will go up 145% next year. One insurer in the state will have a $14,000 deductible.Obamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona, and a catastrophe for all of America.Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is ""the craziest thing in the world,"" where ""people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.""In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said ""the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.""Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, admitted it was all a fraud, and he said, outrageously, that it was passed because of the ""stupidity of the American voter.""Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive.My Contract With the American Voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and I'm asking for your vote so we can save healthcare for every family in Arizona.Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.As you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles.

But she didn't care – as long as she and Bill got the money, the safety of your family didn't matter.To cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear – some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI many times, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.The WikiLeaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government.Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. She'd put it up for sale to special interests and foreign dictators – whoever offers the highest price.Yet, now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI – that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton.97% of Department of Justice employee's presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.There are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she were to become President. Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Attorney General Lynch on her airplane on the tarmac right here in Arizona.This is what we mean when we say the system is rigged.A vote for Hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our Constitutional system itself.What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws – Hillary's corruption shreds the principle on which our nation was founded.Government corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, infecting the whole operation of our government.When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope – they stop dreaming, they stop trying.When the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then people lose confidence in our laws and in our future.Hillary's corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation, and it must be stopped.As FDR once said, ""government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.""Hillary believes money and power – not truth and justice – should rule the day.We have one ultimate check on Hillary's corruption, and that is the power of voting. The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions, including millions of people voting for the first time in their entire lives.Vote with all of your heart and soul to Make America Great Again.Restoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.Haven't we had enough drama with the Clintons? Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice, signed the worst trade deal in history, NAFTA, which emptied our country of it's manufacturing jobs, and he doesn't even have the right to practice law.Hillary has brought scandal or destroyed everything she touched.Look at Whitewater, cattle futures, jobs in Upstate New York, or look at Syria, Iraq, Libya, and now her emails.This will be the year the American people say: enough is enough.This will be the year the American people break with the bitter failures of the past and embrace a new and optimistic future.My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption.I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say.When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs.Right now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty, or near the brink of poverty.America has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Hillary's goal is to send millions and millions more jobs out of our country.Hillary is going to raise taxes up to 45 percent, massively expand regulation, shut down American energy, and push through terrible trade deals that offshore our jobs for the benefit of her donors.Her policies will cause a major recession, or even a depression.A Trump Administration will stop TPP, renegotiate NAFTA, and we are going to stand up to China on Currency Manipulation.We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are going to cut taxes for Middle Class families by hundreds of billions of dollars.My infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like the proposed Interstate-11, which would connect Phoenix with Las Vegas and other areas.We will also unleash the full power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.We will become a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.A Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the endorsement of America's ICE and Border Patrol Officers, the first time they have ever made an endorsement.When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State she allowed thousands of the most dangerous criminal aliens in the world to go free inside America because their home countries wouldn't take them back.These were people guilty of murder, assault, rape, and all manner of violent crime.Hillary has pledged ""open borders,"" and supports Sanctuary Cities.Countless Americans are killed by illegal immigrants because our government won't do it's job.These include amazing Americans like Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, of Mesa Arizona, who was killed by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record who should have been deported – but the government refused to act. I've spent time with his incredible mother.28-year-old Park Ranger Kris Eggle was shot and killed by a drug cartel hit squad responsible for a number of murders. Kris died trying to protect our borders from drug and weapon trafficking into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.33-year-old Phoenix Police Officer Nick Erfle, a young cancer survivor, was murdered by a previously- deported illegal immigrant with a felony warrant. Nick was shot twice in the back of the head.21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, was working at a convenience store in Mesa Arizona when he was shot point blank by an illegal immigrant.His illegal immigrant killer, despite a criminal record, was out on bond, roaming free.When I become President, this crime wave ends.We are going to cancel all federal funding for Sanctuary Cities.We are going to impose tough prison sentences for illegal immigrants who return after a previous deportation.We will end illegal immigration, deport every last criminal alien, and save American lives.We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We have the endorsements of over 200 Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor Recipients.Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it has ever been, and my plan builds the modern, advanced fighter aircraft we need – fighters like those that will be stationed at Luke Air Force Base.Our Army is the smallest it has been since before World War II, and we will significantly increase both the size of our Army and the emphasis we place on intelligence – that means supporting the men and women at Fort Huachuca, home of the Army's Intelligence Center.Places like Marine Corps Air Station Yuma will have new aircraft – they won't have to get spare parts from museums anymore.We also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.Hillary's policies unleashed ISIS, empowered Iran, and spread death and destruction across the Middle East.Hillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before.Our failed establishment has betrayed the American worker and family. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, they have left our borders wide open at home, and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.To all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership.Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days –We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; stop the massive inflow of refugees and keep Radical Islamic Terrorist out of our country; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement; provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.Americans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade.Hillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing – she's just made things worse.She is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future.Our movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests.We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who yearns for a better future.With your vote, we are just 10 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.Together, We Will Make America JUST Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.","UCSB"
"149",2016-10-31,"Donald Trump","Remarks at Macomb Community College South Campus in Warren, Michigan","In 8 days, we are going to win the Great State of Michigan and we are going to win back the White House.Let me start today by making a very important promise. When we win on November 8th, I am going to bring back your jobs. The long nightmare of jobs leaving Michigan will be coming to an end. We will make Michigan the economic envy of the world once again.The political class in Washington has betrayed you. They've uprooted your jobs, and your communities, and shipped your wealth all over the world. They put new skyscrapers up in Beijing while your factories in Michigan crumbled.I will end the theft of American prosperity. I will fight for every last Michigan job.Because, when we win, it's going to be America First.So you have to make sure you get in your absentee ballots, and to get to the polls on November 8th. You have to vote. Vote with all of your heart and soul. Show the whole world how much you love Michigan, and how much you love America, by voting to take back the jobs that have been stolen from you. I'm asking for the vote of Republicans, Democrats, Independents and First-Time voters who want great jobs, safe neighborhoods, and a government that works for the people.I'm asking you to believe in America once again.But to bring back your jobs, we must also immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.It's just been announced that Michigan residents are going to experience crushing double-digit premium hikes.In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said ""the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.""Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive – in fact, much more expensive. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Michigan.Real change also means restoring honesty to our government.As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and has discovered another 650,000 emails. Hillary lied under oath when she said she turned over all of her work-related emails – just one more lie out of so many.This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. Hillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she has brought this all onto herself. Hillary is the one who set-up an illegal private email server in a closet to shield her criminal activity.Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt Pay-For-Play scheme at the State Department – and now there are 5 FBI probes into the Clinton Foundation and their pay-for-play activities. Hillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server, putting the safety of the American people under threat.Hillary is the one who lied to Congress under oath. Hillary is the one who lied to the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear. Hillary is the one who destroyed 33,000 emails. Hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again. We can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating.Hillary is not the victim – the American people are the victims of this corrupt system in every way, and this is your one chance to change it.Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a very long time. One of her longtime supporters, a top Democratic Pollster, Doug Schoen, is now totally withdrawing his support. He wrote an article entitled ""I'm a Democrat, I worked for Bill Clinton, but I can't vote for Hillary.""Schoen writes: ""I am now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious consequences should Secretary Clinton win the election.""Schoen warns that if Hillary is elected, she would be under protracted criminal investigation – and probably a trial of a sitting President.The investigation will last for years, a trial will probably start, nothing will get done, and our country will continue to suffer.She is unfit and unqualified to be President, and her election would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis we cannot afford. We need to be going to work for the American people – we can't do that with Hillary in the White House trying to avoid prosecution.Hillary Clinton's corruption is a threat to Democracy, and the only way to save our Democracy is get out and vote by the millions.The Clinton crime spree ends on November 8th. And when we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter focused on the American People.My Contract with The American Voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to our government.I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say. When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going to drain the swamp.At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs.Michigan has lost more than 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, a deal strongly supported by Hillary Clinton.Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Our country has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit with the world. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Our trade deficit with China grew almost 40 percent during Hillary's tenure as Secretary of State. Her trade deal with South Korea killed another 100,000 America jobs.So when you look around Michigan, and you see the rusted-out factories, the empty buildings, and the long unemployment lines, remember: Hillary Clinton did much of this to you.Hillary got rich selling your jobs – the same special interests who pushed the jobs out of America are the people who've given countless millions to the Clintons. Hillary gets rich making America poor.Just look at the devastation. Delphi laid off 3,627 workers here in Michigan. Most of those jobs went to Mexico. We are going to fight for the workers at Delphi. They got a raw deal, and they deserve better.GM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion Assembly Plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed through by Hillary Clinton.Lear Corporation laid off another 50 people in Rochester Hills and moved their jobs to South Korea.FTE Automotive laid off 166 people in Auburn Hills. Their jobs went to Mexico.Chrysler laid off over 5,300 workers. Those jobs went to Mexico, China, India and other countries.Ford laid off 2,155 workers. Those jobs went to other countries.Now, Ford is moving all if its small car production to Mexico.A Trump Administration will stop the flight of American jobs.If Ford, or another company, announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or another country, then I will pick up the phone – I will call the executives – and I will tell them that if they want do that, we will charge a 35% tax when they try to ship their products back across the border.It used to be the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We are going to turn it all around. We are going to rebuild Flint. We are going to rebuild Detroit. And we are going to rebuild Michigan.I'd like to share a special message today with the African-American community in Michigan which has been so terribly harmed by the policies of the Clintons.Look at the City of Detroit. It used to be the manufacturing hub of the world – now, nearly half of Detroit residents do not work, it has the second-highest violent crime rate in the country, and the children are trapped in failing government schools.Yet, as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees.I've outlined a plan for urban renewal, it's called A New Deal For Black America. That deal includes a plan to use the money we will save by securing our border, and curbing refugee admissions, to invest in communities like Flint and Detroit.It includes a pledge of school choice for African-American children.My plan also includes a promise to cancel billions in climate change spending for the United Nations – a number Hillary wants to increase – and instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure, including clean water in cities like Flint.My plan also includes a pledge to reduce violent crime – every child in this nation has a right to grow up in safety and peace. And my plan includes a pledge to restore manufacturing in the United States.Hillary and the Democratic Party have run the inner cities for years, and only produced more poverty. The time has come for real change – I'm asking you for the honor of your vote so that together we can turn decades of political failure into generations of lasting success.Hillary, on the other hand, wants to destroy what's left of manufacturing in Michigan with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A Trump Administration will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.We will renegotiate NAFTA and, if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal. We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We are going to massively cut taxes for the Middle Class.We will unleash American energy – including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. The Obama-Clinton war on coal is going to cost this state 50,000 jobs.We will also work to restore and protect the Great Lakes. We are going to become a rich country again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees. Hillary's immigration plans mean generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism spreading into your schools and communities here in Michigan.When we win, we will suspend the Syrian Refugee Program – and we will keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.A Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall.We've received the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been – it's a national emergency. They also warn America that Hillary's plan is the ""the most radical proposal in U.S. history.""When I become President, we will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens, and put American Workers First.We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military.We also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.Hillary led us to disaster in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Then, after Benghazi, she looked the families of the fallen in the eye and lied – she blamed it all on a video.Hillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before. Imagine if some of that money had been spent building new schools, roads and bridges right here in Michigan.Now, Hillary – trapped in her Washington bubble that is blind to the lessons of the past – wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia, that could drag us into World War III.The arrogant political class never learns. They keep repeating the same mistakes, they keep telling the same lies, they keep producing the same failed results.How can Hillary manage this country when she can't even manage her email server? It's just one disaster after another, one scandal after another, one betrayal after another.To all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership.Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days –We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.Hillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change, and wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I am asking you to dream big, to push for bold change, and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this country.I'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day – when they really mean another decade.America is tired of waiting. The moment is now.All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country.There is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done — the future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics.Hillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing – she's just made things worse.

"150",2016-11-01,"Donald Trump","Remarks on Obamacare in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania","Thank you very much. Thank you. [applause]I would like to thank my incredible running mate, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. [applause]And I love you, too. [applause]We have a lot of very enthused and excited people in this campaign. So I really do thank all of you. [applause]I would like to thank my incredible running mate, Mike Pence, on the tremendous job he's done. And he's a fantastic leader and a leader on health care...[applause]I'd also like to thank Dr. Ben Carson. [applause]Not only a great man, and I don't say that about a lot of people, but one of the toughest competitors I've ever faced. People don't know how well he did during those primaries. And I just kept looking back. And I just kept seeing him. And boy, I'll tell you. But even more importantly, he's a brilliant physician and I hope he will be very much involved with my administration in the coming years. [applause]Thank you.I'd also like to recognize the distinguished members of Congress in attendance who have all been at the forefront of health care, and have been so helpful to me: Congresswoman Ellmers, Lummis; Congressmen Price, Harris, Burgess and DesJarlais. [applause]And let me give a special thanks to Senator Barrasso, a terrific doctor, a Senate leader, who did incredible work chairing our platform committee, just unbelievable work. So I want to thank you very much, Senator. Fantastic job. [applause]And been very, very loyal to what we're doing and what we represent. So thank you, Senator. When we win on November 8th...[applause]...and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. [applause]I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace and it will be such an honor for me, for you and for everybody in this country because Obamacare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe. The president said if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Which may go down as one of the great political lies of the century. Even the skeptical Democrats believed him and approved the legislation. There were Democrats that were very much against it, but they believed him and they approved it. No one ever read, or certainly very few people, the 2,700 page bill. To this day, nobody understands it. The Obama administration has just announced massive double digit and triple digit Obamacare premium hikes everywhere, all throughout the country. Here in Pennsylvania, premiums are going to increase more than 60 percent and that's nothing compared to what will happen in the future. Of course, in the future, I'm president, there won't be Obamacare, so you won't have to worry about it. [applause]That means parents won't have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids. In the great state of Arizona, a wonderful place I just left, premiums will go up even higher than 116 percent. Other states are going up more than 60, 70, 80, 90 percent. Deductibles can go to $12,000, $13,000, $14,000, even $15,000. In other words, your health care won't even be usable. You're paying all this money, you won't even get to use it. People all across the country are devastated. In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which, by the way, is a first in American history. This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life. One-third of the counties -- think of this, one-third of the counties in Pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left if you have that. That includes Philadelphia, where I went to school. The Associated Press found that some of the 440,000 Pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcare.gov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation. The people of Philadelphia. Insurers are leaving, premiums are soaring, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof. Workers' hours are being cut, hiring is frozen -- totally frozen -- and wages are being slashed. Obamacare means higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. She wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in America. If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever. It's one of the single most important reasons why we must win on November 8th, we must win. [applause]Thank you. [applause]Thank you.Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.Our replacement plan includes health savings accounts, a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines and letting states manage Medicaid dollars so much better. We will create quality, reliable, affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really wanna make for their families. It will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost.We've also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every American family. And while this is really -- thank you. [applause]While this is really a meeting and that's what it is, it's a meeting of very, very special people and I appreciate you all being here. But it's a meeting talking about health care and Obamacare. Our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs. We have to do it. [applause] We're gonna bring back your manufacturing, we're gonna bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the American middle class and our country as a wholeOur jobs are being stolen. Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. The city of Philadelphia has lost more than one-third of its manufacturing jobs since China joined the Word Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, believe me. And we have the greatest negotiators in the world. We will use our great negotiators. [applause]We'll have a fair deal, but we'll have a deal that goes in two directions, not one direction, right into Mexico and these other places. [applause]And stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation and unfair subsidy behavior. [applause]We are going to bring manufacturing jobs, lots of jobs, back to Pennsylvania. We're gonna do it. And it won't even be difficult. [applause]We're going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners. Our miners have been mistreated horribly. [applause]We will be producing clean coal, oil, natural gas and shale energy. [applause]We're also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt, so badly hurt. [applause]Whose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over the state, and frankly, all over this country, by China and other countries. Nobody has been treated worse than these workers, but that will change on January 20th of next year, believe me. It will change. [applause]We're also going to provide the children of the state with school choice. So important. [applause]That means parents can spend and take care of their children, but they can send their kids to public school, to private, to chartered, to magnet, to religious or to home school. It's going to be their right and it's going to be something that's so, so good for your children and for the education of your children. [applause]We will also totally eliminate Common Core and bring education local. We're gonna bring it local. [applause]People do not like Common Core in this country, that I can tell you. [laughter]And our system is failing, so it's obviously not working. We're gonna eliminate Common Core, we're gonna bring it local.Our tax plan will provide a 35 percent tax cut to middle class families with two kids. As an example, you have two kids, a 35 percent cut so desperately needed. Our middle class has not been properly respected, that I can tell you. [applause]We will let parents deduct childcare expenses from their taxes and create tax-free childcare and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low income families. [applause]We will eliminate the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. When did we ever need it more? Greatest people on Earth in our military, but it's badly depleted. [applause]Thank you. People love this country, don't they? Isn't it beautiful, right? Beautiful. [applause]It's a beautiful thing to watch and see. And I see it all over the country, no matter where we go. And every time I say we are going to rebuild our depleted military, it's always the same response. It's an incredible response. [applause]Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I, think of that. Smallest since World War I. And rebuilding it will require a national effort. That's why I will ask my Secretary of the Navy to review facilities like the Philadelphia Navy Yard, I know it well. [applause]With a long history of service to our Navy, proximity to vibrant private industry and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again. [applause]To recruit master craftsmen this buildup requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the Philadelphia Navy Yard.Vocational training is a great thing. We don't do it anymore. We don't do it anymore. [applause]And I must tell you, so often in going to college right down the road and going to college, we have people that were brilliant and we had other people that weren't as brilliant in that way but were brilliant, incredible when it came to fixing a motor, when it came to fixing something that I had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses had no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded. And we don't do that anymore. Vocational training for our country is so, so, so important. [applause]And just in closing -- and they loved it. They loved it. They didn't want to be doing what I was doing. They loved it. They were so good at it and they loved it. So vocational training, we're going to start it up big league. [applause]We will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country. I'm not a politician. My only special interest is you, the American people. That's why I've done this. [applause]Thank you very much. [applause]The guiding rule of the political class in Washington, D.C. is that they are looking out only for themselves, only for themselves with the exception of these few people. [laughter]I feel guilty as I'm looking, they're staring me in the eyes. So I have to say with these exceptions. They will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense. I'm running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the American people to create generations of success. I'm running... [applause]I'm running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities. We need safety. And by the way, our law enforcement officials, these are great, great people. [applause]Thank you. And we are going to give great prosperity to our economy. I want to go into our poorest communities and work on a national plan of revitalization, the inner cities. [applause]And I've been working with so many African-American groups. These are such incredible people. We've been talking about it, working on it. We're going to bring jobs into the inner cities. We're going to bring safety. We're going to bring education, good, good schools into the inner cities. [applause]The spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody. And it's gonna work. It's gonna work. You watch. Americans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day. But politicians for the most part really mean another decade, because that's what they're talking about. Enough waiting. Time is now. But to accomplish our goals, we must cut our ties with the small, bitter, petty politics of the past. We must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end, that we never win and that have made us far less safe. Think of it. [applause]Think of all the money that's spent, all the lives that have been lost.And we're far less safe today than we were before we started. They've left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. It's time for new leadership. [applause]I've led a great life and I truly love our country. So now I want to give back to the country that's been so good to me, that's why I'm doing this. [applause]All I see everywhere I travel in this nation, and I've been everywhere, is untapped potential waiting to be realized. The people are amazing, the people are amazing. If we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach. [applause]If we stopped believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves, then anything, anything is possible. [applause]I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country. [applause]That is how we will truly make America great again. [applause]Thank you very much, thank you everybody. God bless you, thank you. [applause]","UCSB"
"151",2016-11-02,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Central Florida Fairgrounds in Orlando, Florida","Thank you, everybody, thank you. Wow. These crowds. [applause]These crowds are terrific. Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida. And we are going to win back the White House. That will happen. But you have to get out, you have to vote, we have to get out there. We don't want to blow it. That I can tell you because we have worked very hard, all of us, you, me, everybody. And it's very historic what's happening. I'd like to begin today by thanking all of you for joining me. This has been an incredible journey and we've all done it together. We're almost at the end. [applause]But we're really at the end of the beginning if you think about it. Aren't we? The end of the beginning. Our magnificent history movement has surprised the world and defied expectations at every single turn. And now, next Tuesday, we will have one last glorious surprise for the pundits, the politicians and the special interests and return the power back to the people. It's going to happen. [applause]It's going to happen. It's been the honor of my life share this journey with you, it has absolutely been. [applause]There are two people, however, who I did not really get to share this with but who are in my thoughts often. And that's my mother and my father, great people. [applause]I had great parents. Great parents. I know they're up there watching, I just felt that nice breeze. It's hot, but I just felt that nice breeze [applause]So they're helping us out. And I just want to say thank you to both of them. Special, special people. I've had a great life and now I want to give back to the country that I love. It's time, we have to we have to give back, folks [applause]I've seen how the career of politicians, the big donors and the special interests have bled this country dry and stripped our middle class and stripped our companies of its jobs and its wealth. But we're just six days away from delivering justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country[applause]Justice for every child trapped in poverty in the inner cities, for every family that's born—and you know that, they've been born into a situation in some case; they can't get out of it. We're going to get them out of it. We're going to get them out of it. We have endless wars. Every community's hopes and dreams have been shattered and we're not going to let that happen. Our inner cities are going to come back and they're going to come back strong and your going to see what I mean. [applause]And the African-American community and the Hispanic community are really understanding what's going on and you see that right now. You see that right now in what's happening at the polls. We're winning in Florida, we're winning in Ohio, we're winning in Iowa, in North Carolina. We're doing great in Pennsylvania. A lot of people are saying Pennsylvania's looking very good. So many different places. We just got a poll with three up in Virginia. [applause]But we are seriously up in Florida. That's very important [applause]And I will never, ever let you down. Real change begins immediately with repealing and replacing Obamacare, a disaster. [applause]A disaster. [applause]It is a disaster. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. [booing]I will not tell you what the number is. I know the number very well, but I want you to leave happy. You don't want to hear the number, go home, relax, wake up good and strong tomorrow morning. You'll learn, you're not going to like it. In the great state of Arizona, where we just left, the premiums are going up more than 116 percent. [booing]Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida and by the way, in the primaries, I won 66 out of 67 primaries. That's good. [applause]I was going to try and exaggerate and say I won them all, but I can't do that. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers next year, they're leaving. They're all leaving. In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Obamacare is a total catastrophe. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. [booing]I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Florida, so important. [applause]Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. [applause]As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into crooked Hillary Clinton. [applause]Hillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and I don't see if you've watched her last few speeches over the last few days. She has become totally unhinged, unbelievable. What she's saying and what she's doing is actually, it's unbelievable. But she has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State Department. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI. Hilary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer and who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after, after, after, after receiving a congressional subpoena, think of that. [booing]Unbelievable. [booing]And as you know, they just found—listen to this and I guess you know it, 650,000 e-mails. [booing]And I would say that classified, confidential, I think they're probably all over the place. I think they're—I think they're gonna find a treasure trough. I can't even imagine. In fact, they said well, this is OK they're duplicates. How could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place, right? You know, when they deleted 33,000 I thought that was a lot. They have 650,000? Hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat. [booing]Instead of reporting the breach. That's a big deal. You know, to me that's a big deal. Some people say oh, that's fine, that's a big deal. That's really—that's a real cheater, OK? That's a cheater. And she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the DNC or be fired. [applause]But that's a really big deal. And you notice, they never—the dishonest prospect, the most dishonest. [booing]If you notice, they never go after Hillary. They always talk about Donna Brazile, Donna Brazile didn't do it. But can you imagine if I got—can you imagine, they gave the questions to Donald Trump before a debate. [applause]You know it would be the electric chair. They'd reinstitute the electric chair. No.It'd be headlines all over the world. This isn't headlines.I bring it up; it's brought up a little bit. But this isn't like a big deal. She got the debate questions and answers.But she got the debate questions prior to a debate. Now, Bernie Sanders should be angry right? Shouldn't he be angry?Now, I'll tell you what. The system is rigged. The system is rigged.I've been saying it for a—it's rigged, and we're gonna straighten it out. But the system is rigged. Hillary is not the victim; the American people are the victims of this system. [applause]So corrupt in so many ways. And this is your one chance to change it because you know what?In four years, not gonna happen. There's no way. The numbers won't work.In four years, there's no way. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. And if she were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. I mean before you go into phase two—let's call what happened on Friday phase two. Phase one, she's so guilty. She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency. That's why I say the system is rigged. She shouldn't be allowed to run. But I have a feeling in the 650,000 e-mails, they're gonna find things that you will not even believe. Who knows. 650,000 e-mails. No wonder she can't do anything.No, no. How do you work? How do you do it?650,000. They'll have to explain that to us some day.But they'll have some things in there that I can just imagine are going to be unbelievable. Hillary's likely to be under investigation for many years. Probably concluding in a criminal trial. Out today, WikiLeaks just came out with a new one. Just a little while ago. It's just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion, possibly illegal between the Department of Justice, the Clinton campaign, and the State Department. You saw that. The e-mails show that the Assistant Attorney General who's involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to John Podesta and the Clinton campaign. Can you believe this? [booing]She shouldn't be allowed to run.By the way, behind me, the great Johnny Damon. The curse of the Yankees, but ultimately he helped the Yankees. Johnny Damon.Stand up Johnny. [applause]Now, I'll tell ya. George Steinbrenner was a good friend of mine. Oh, he didn't like Johnny too much.Then he ultimately signed him and then he was fine. He did great.But Johnny Damon was a champ. He was a winner. And he loves this area, you know that. My contract with the American voter begins with a tough ethics reform, and it ends—I'll tell you what. We are going to end—we have no choice. We really have no choice—government corruption. It's going to end. [applause]I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will say right now when we win on November 8. We are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton with the support of crooked Hillary. [booing]America has lost—this is so hard to believe—70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. They're leaving. We're going to stop itAnd you have an excellent governor, by the way. He's fighting hard for you folks. I don't know—I don't know. All I can tell you is he is a worker, he is a worker, and he's fighting very hard. The theft of American prosperity will end and it'll end, I'll tell you. We are—it is being stolen from us folks. It is—we have a one-way highway right into Mexico, right into other countries. And we're going to stop it. From now on, it's going to be America first. [applause]America first. [applause]It's going to be America first. [applause]A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and all of the unfair subsidy behaviors. It's horrible what's happening to us. Our politicians don't have a clue, they don't know what they're doing—or other things, OK. We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Killing our jobs. Our companies are leaving. Killing our jobs. We will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. In Orlando, the murder rate doubled, you know that? Doubled last year. Can you believe it? We will support our police, and I met you police of Orlando, they are unbelievable people and they've been through a lot. I met the police and these are unbelievable people. We will bring this crime wave to an end. We will also keep our community safe from terrorism. Just a short time ago, Orlando was the victim of the worst mass shooting in American history during the Islamic terror attack on The Pulse nightclub. It was also the worst attack on the LGBTQ community in our country's history. Can't let it happen, can't let it happen. Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent Syrian refugees pouring into our country. [booing]Her plan would mean generations of terrorism, radicalism, and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refuge program. [applause]And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your community. [applause]Got to keep them out. And we'll build safe zones in Syria. We have to help the people. We're going to build safe zones, but the Gulf States haven't been doing their thing. And believe me, they have plenty of money. They'll help us, they'll fund it, I'm sure they'll be thrilled. They're going to be funding it, and that will be OK. We want to help people. But we have enough problems in this country. We don't need Orlando and problems. We don't need what happened in San Bernadino. We don't need what's happening in Paris, in Nice and in Germany—which is a disaster. We don't need it. We have enough problems right now, do we agree? We have enough problems. We don't need it. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. [applause]And yes, we will build a great wall. [applause]We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers, great people. The officers that warned that Hillary's plan is the most quote, radical immigration proposal in United States history, and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, quote. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries were intelligent, they wouldn't take them back.We bring them to their countries—murderers, drug dealers, gang members, we'd bring them to their countries and their countries would say: get them out, we're not taking them back. They call up the State Department, and the State Department under Hillary Clinton would say: oh, bring them back, we don't want to make waves. I guarantee you, whether it's four years or eight years, that will not happen once under a Trump administration. [applause]Hillary wants totally open borders and strongly supports sanctuary cities. Like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle—incredible young woman—was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities immediately. We will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens—the ones we just spoke about—and we will save American lives. We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our very badly depleted military. [applause]That includes major new investments in resources from Pensacola Naval Air Station at MacDill Air Force Base. Have you ever heard of those places? Pretty good places. A lot of people here, lot of people. I'm honored to have the endorsement of 200—more than that now, much more than that—top Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. Great people, I've met so many of them, they're incredible. Incredible people. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spend $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never won and that never end. And it's now in worse shape than ever before. The Middle East is a catastrophe, it's far worse off than had we spent nothing.They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home. And they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And it's—it's disappearing. Our country, in a certain sense, is disappearing. Prosperity—real prosperity is disappearing. We owe $20 trillion. Our trade deals, we lose $800 billion a year on trade. We have trade deficits. Think of that. Who negotiates these deals? You know who does? Stupid people. Stupid people. [applause]With very stupid leadership. Who, by the way, they campaign all the time. He's campaigning right now for crooked Hillary. [booing]Why is he campaigning? She's under federal investigation, and we've got a president campaigning for her. And that's all he does is campaign. He ought to be working on your jobs that are leaving and going to Mexico. And your military. [applause]I'll tell you what, first of all, she's got bigger problems. But four more years of Obama, we can't take it, folks. Four more years of ISIS, that's what it is. Four more years of no jobs. Now, she wants to start a shooting war in Syria and conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III. Russia is heavily armed, doesn't like her. Putin does not respect her, doesn't like her. What are we doing, folks? She's a mess. To all Americans, I say it's time for new leadership. [applause]Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. [applause]Thank you. It's so beautiful over there. I just noticed the water. Let's go in for a swim. It's about 200 degrees out there.Anybody want to go swimming? Let's go. [applause]We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. And Hillary wants to increase your taxes by a tremendous amount. You know, we're already the highest-taxed nation in the world. She wants to increase your taxes, if you can believe that one. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. Killing your companies. Killing them. One of the reasons they're leaving. Cancel every illegal Obama executive order. [applause]We're going to rebuild our military and take care of our great, great veterans. They're not being taken care of. You know that. A lot of veterans here. We're going to take care of our veterans finally. They have been mistreated for many, many years. We're going to support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]We will save the Second Amendment which is, as you know, under tremendous siege. [applause]We will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]We will show the world that there is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. There's no dream—no dream outside of our reach. We have all these people telling us what to do. Politicians—they know nothing. I've dealt with them all my life, folks. All talk, no action. I have some friends that are politicians. So let me just say there's some good ones. OK? There are some good.I'll tell you what, you take a look at the media. These are the most dishonest people anywhere. [booing]These are the most—they—the media—the media is a part and one of the vital cogs in the rigged system under which we live. They're a big fat cog in the—and they never show the crowds. They never show what's happening. But you know what? You hear—when you hear 20,000, sometimes 30,000, when you hear people, sounds like you're at an Ohio State football game. [applause]But they never show it. They never show it. [applause]They never show it.People of Florida, we love you. All we have to do is cut our ties with these failed politicians of the past. Hillary is a candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are. [applause]We're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, independents and first-time voters, of which we're finding out there are many. You probably heard over the last couple of weeks ""Texas is in play""; ""Texas—that Georgia is in play."" And I'm saying, ""Gee, that's too bad."" Let me tell you, they're setting records in Texas, and they're voting for Trump, just so you understand that. [applause]And they know it. [applause]But when they see those numbers coming, they don't want to announce them. But we are winning almost everywhere. I think—give us two more days, I think we're going to be winning everywhere. [applause]And I'm almost starting to think that the least important problem that Hillary has is the fact that we're winning. I think she's got perhaps bigger problems than even that. [applause]We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and nor Hillary's special interests. [applause]We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future. [applause]I am asking you to dream big—I got to dream big. Because with your vote, we are just—can you believe this?—six days away. Think of that. [applause]From the change you've been waiting for your entire life. [applause]We're going to work together. We're going to vote. You're going to vote now or you're going to vote by the 8th. But you're going to vote.Thank you. I love that guy. He's a tough guy, but he just screamed out, ""You're going to win."" We're going to win. Thank you, man. Thank you. [applause]We have great, great love.You know, we're in a divided nation. We are a divided nation. We're not going to be divided. We're going to have such love in this country. We're going to have such love and such respect. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. [applause]We will make America safe again. [applause]And we will make America great again. [applause]Thank you very much. Thank you, folks. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. [applause]Thank you. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. Thank you. [applause]","UCSB"
"152",2016-11-02,"Donald Trump","Remarks at the Bayfront Park Amphitheater in Miami, Florida","Thank you. Thank you. [applause]I love that sign, ""Blacks for Trump."" I love that sign, thank you. [applause]There are a lot of those signs. Thank you. ""Women for Trump."" [applause]""Hispanics for Trump."" [applause]There's one ""Women and Hispanics for Trump."" [applause]Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House 100 percent. [applause]We're on the cusp of an incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families, communities and citizens, to you. The system is rigged, remember that. The system is rigged. Right now it's rigged. We're going to change it.There's some breaking news about that subject that we're going to discuss right now. As I mentioned yesterday, on of the—and you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read it.one of the top Department of Justice officials involved in the e-mail investigation, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kassig [booing]is a close associate of John Podesta. The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi and Podesta, who by the way said Hillary Clinton has terrible instincts on WikiLeaks, described him as the man who kept him, Podesta, out of jail. Kadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Now, today, in a newly released e- mail—through WikiLeaks again—we learned that Kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the Clinton campaign and that [booing]right? And that Kadzik said quote ""It will be a while before the State Department posts the e-mails."" Remember they were waiting for the e-mails. [booing]Podesta forwarded the e-mails to Clinton's top staff and said, additional chances for mischief. These are the people that want to run our country, folks. [booing]The spread of political agendas into the Justice Department—there's never been a thing like this that has happened in our country's history—is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country. But with your vote you can beat the system, the rigged system, and deliver justice. So, show up early and vote. Show up early. You know, the lines are incredible. The polls are all saying we're going to win Florida. Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Get out there and vote. Pretend we're slightly behind. You got to get—we don't want to blow this. This is the one chance we have, it'll never happen again. It's not going to happen. In four years, it's not going to happen—it can't happen again. This is a movement like we have never seen in this country before. These crowds, the enthusiasm, the love. [applause]Got to get out and vote. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause]And Hillary is not going to be the answer because she wants to make it more expensive. She's doubling down. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida—sorry to tell you this, folks—are going to experience a massive, massive double digit premium hike. [booing]Now, I know what that hike is, but I want you to leave here happy, I want you to be happy people. I want you to think about the future after we take back the White House so I'm not going to tell you what your hike is, but let me just say it's going to be very substantial. And Obamacare doesn't work on top of everything else. As an example, in the great state of Arizona—which I just left—premiums are going up more than 116 percent. It's out of control. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year. Lots of luck in your negotiation. In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor said, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof. Wasn't supposed to be like this, but I said it was going to be like this before it was passed because I understand how business works. Obamacare never had a chance. It's a catastrophe. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive. It's going to go up a lot. People aren't going to be able to afford it so I'm not sure that it matters, they're just not going to be able to pay. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and the United States. [applause]Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI has—did you hear about this little event? The FBI re-opening the investigation. [applause]They're re-opening the investigation into Crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing]Crooked Hillary, she's crooked. [booing]Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!She is a crooked one, there's no question. Crooked Hillary Clinton, you know that term has really stuck, everyone's calling her—has anyone seen Crooked Hillary Clinton today? [applause]That's going to be a great term for a president, right? Boy, oh boy, what a mess. This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. And now it's been reported that there are FBI inquiries probing virtually all of Hillary Clinton's inner circle and many of the things she's done over the years. It's about time. Remember, it's a rigged system, remember it's about time. She wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she really has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. The woman screaming exactly, exactly, it is exactly. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay-for-play scheme at the State Department and who ripped off the people of Haiti, the people of Haiti were ripped off. [booing]And I met with the people of Little Haiti. Anybody here?These are great people, great, thank you.Hillary is the one who endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. [booing]And she's the one who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a Congressional subpoena. [booing]She also accepted debate questions given to her in advance by Donna Brazile [booing]and then used those debate questions to cheat. It's cheating, the worst level. Instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach. So she got the answers, cheating. She got the questions, cheating. And then she—rather than reporting them, rather than saying this shouldn't be happening—she used them against Bernie Sanders. Can you imagine. she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy I don't think it mattered. We won those debates. [applause]Did you see her at the end of the debates? Folks, she was exhausted. You know what she did? She immediately went home and went to sleep. [applause]Hillary is not the victim, and the American people, frankly, are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way. But this is your chance finally to change it, November 8th. Now in Florida's case, earlier. Now, just so you understand, record turnout, unbelievable numbers, unbelievable. We're doing great with the African-American community. [applause]We're doing great with the Hispanic community. [applause]And the lines are four, five and six blocks long. They've never seen anything like it. And the polls have just come up. We're way up in Florida. I shouldn't say that, because I want you to go vote. [applause]OK, ready? We're going to pretend we're down. We're down. Pretend, right? We'll pretend we're down. No, we got to win. We got to win big. We got to beat her. Got to beat her. We're up in Ohio, we're up in Iowa, we're up in North Carolina. [applause]I think we're doing great in Pennsylvania; from what I hear. [applause]Folks, you're going to be so proud. You're going to be so proud. We're going to make America great again. You're going to be so happy and you're going to be so proud of your country again. If Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. [booing]Haven't we just been through a lot with the Clintons, right? Remember when he was impeached for lying? He can't practice law. He doesn't have the right to practice law. Didn't we just go through this? And the last thing we need is another four years of Obama. That's the last thing. [booing]And this will be worse. That means ISIS, that means high taxes, that means bad health care, that means no border. Without a border, we don't have a country. The work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected. She'll be in court for her entire tenure and she'll be convicted. Because look, the first time—I mean, frankly, forget about this time. The first time she gets a subpoena from the United States Congress and she deletes everything? There shouldn't have been a second time. But I have respect that the FBI has given it a second chance. And this time, I have no doubt that in that 650,000 e-mails—did you see where they said, oh, we're not worried. They're duplicates. How can there be duplicates if there are hundreds of thousands more than you started off with? [booing]So today, I guess WikiLeaks, it sounds like, is going to be dropping some more, and if we met tomorrow, I'll tell you about it tomorrow, but one beauty that's been caught was, and this was just recently, newly released, where they say having a dump. We're having a dump of all of those e-mails.In another communication, Bill Clinton's chief of staff says foreign government—right, this should be another one. Just like swamp—you know the swamp little statement—this one, this one. Do you remember what it is? Right? All the money is in, right? They said all the money is in. They're talking about foreign money pouring into their pockets. They said all the money is in. [booing]This is what is running for office. Honestly, she should be ashamed of herself. She should be ashamed of herself.My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty to our government. That includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Makes sense. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will be saying right now. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]Gonna drain the swamp. We're gonna drain the swamp, folks. We're gonna drain that swamp. [applause]Another important issue for Americans is integrity in journalism. These people are among the most dishonest people I've ever met, spoken to, done business with. These are the most dishonest people. [booing]There has never been dishonesty—there has never been dishonesty like we've seen in this election. There's never been anywhere near the media dishonesty like we've seen in this election. Don't worry, they won't spin the cameras and show the kind of massive crowds. They won't do that. [booing]The very talented Michael Goodwin of the New York Post just wrote today that 2016 presidential race will mark the low-water mark of journalism that is worthy—think of it—of the First Amendment. Never before have so many media organizations, old and new, abandoned all pretense of fairness to take sides and try to pick a president. [booing]It's unbelievable. It's un-honest.For instance, we have a great story. We give it out to the media. They'll make it look as bad as possible—as bad as possible. ParentheticallySo sad. Parenthetically and very sadly, earnings for the New York Times are down 97 percent this year. They just announced that. So bad. I feel so badly for them. Just announced—97 percent. Oh, they're doing great. And then they tell you who to vote for, you know? Who to vote for. They want crooked Hillary. This isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country. And they're talking about it all over the world. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back jobs. [applause]Right now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty. Forty-three percent of African- American school-aged children live in poverty. Thirty-two percent of Hispanic school-aged children live in poverty. This is America, this is the United States, this is unacceptable. As your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization. [applause]We will replace decades of failure with generations of success. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary. [booing]And here's a number that you should remember because it's not even a believable number, and it's correct. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs left in the history of the world. Our jobs are going to Mexico, our jobs are going to other countries. China and others are making our product. We don't make it anymore. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. [applause]My second home, you know that, I'm here all the time. My second home, great place.The theft of American prosperity will end. So they are stealing our prosperity, horribly stealing our prosperity. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we'll stand up to foreign product dumping all over the place. [applause]Currency manipulation by China and many other countries and all of the unfair subsidy behavior that's going on all over the world against us. We will also immediately stop the job-killing, Trans- Pacific Partnership, a disaster. [applause]And Hillary wants it to happen, she called it the gold standard, then she rejected it. But she's going to approve it. Then she lied during the debate, right? She lied. [booing]She lied during the debate. She said she never called it the gold standard, she lied. And she lied about the line in the sand, right? She lied. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. [applause]We will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations [applause]and use that money to support America's vital environmental infrastructure and natural resources. We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars. We don't even know who's doing what with the money. We're gonna spend the money here. We're gonna work on our own environment. [applause]That includes repairing the Herbert Hoover Dike at Lake Okeechobee and protecting the Florida Everglades. [applause]We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation [applause]A terrible tragedy today has occurred in Iowa. You read, you saw. Early this morning, two Iowa police officers, outstanding, outstanding people, were murdered, ambushed, ambushed violently while sitting in their squad cars. We send our thoughts and prayers to the family of the fallen. I just left Iowa, most beautiful place. The treatment was so incredible, the crowds, the police officers were so incredible the job they did. Now two of them are dead. An attack on our police is an attack on all of us. [applause]Law enforcement is the line separating civilization from total chaos, you have to remember that. [applause]According to the national law enforcement officers, Memorial Fund, firearm related police were up 48 percent this year, the highest they've ever been. And there have been 14 ambush style attacks this year alone, never had anything like this. And what it is, is a lack of respect for our nation, it's a lack of respect for our leadership. To all the great men and women of law enforcement I want you to know, we're with you, we support you and we will stand by you. [applause]We will restore law order and justice in America—justice. [applause]Thank you. Thank you, so good luck to the people of Iowa.We will also work with our federal and local law enforcements to keep America safe from terrorism. [applause]Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our countries. [booing]Her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and all throughout your communities. When I'm president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program[applause]and we will keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of your community. [applause]Now, we all have heart and we're gonna build safe zones and we're gonna have some of the Gulf States that have nothing but money, they'll put up the money, we'll lead it, we'll build safe zones. But we have enough problems in our country. She wants to increase the thousands and thousands that are pouring in right now. She wants to increase that number by 550 percent. And then, you wonder why Podesta says, she has bad instincts and you wonder why Bernie Sanders says, she's got bad judgment, they're right. She's got bad judgment, personally I think she's a very unstable person, if you wanna really know the truth. [applause]And we're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare, but you wanna know something? Honestly, I think for herself she's got much bigger problems right now than Obamacare. She's got bigger problems. [applause]Let's see what's on all those e-mails that they just found, see what's on those e-mails.Thank you.It's too bad those cameras aren't turning around to see this incredible group of people with thousands more outside, isn't it too bad? [applause]They don't do it. But you know, if Hillary speaks and there's 30 people in the line they say, the crowd is massive. [booing]She's never had a crowd like this in her life. [applause]President Obama shouldn't be campaigning for any longer, it's really a conflict, right? He oughta be working on jobs, on the border, on building up our military instead of campaigning for crooked Hillary Clinton, is what he oughta be doing. [applause]He's in North Carolina, but we're going to North Carolina right after this, so. [applause]But we have a few more today in Florida, and we have massive crowds. There's something happening. They're not reporting it. Katie, you're not reporting it, Katie. [applause]But there's something happening, Katie. There's something happening, Katie. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build the wall. [applause]Thank you. [applause]We've received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. [applause]They tell us the border crisis taking place right now is the worst it's ever been. Now, in all fairness, people probably figure that I'm going to win. [applause]So, they're racing across the border. I don't know. I'm sorry to do this to you, folks. [applause]Hillary has pledged totally open borders, meaning you don't have a country anymore. And she strongly supports sanctuary cities like in San Francisco where[booing]Right? Where Kate Steinle was killed by a five time deported illegal immigrant. [booing]The immigration officers warn that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives. And I believe that. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their countries would not take them back. [booing]Countless innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Last year, as an example, 17-year-old Starlett Pitts, her boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to death in their Lee High Acres home by an illegal immigrant. The killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery. And the people that knew him were begging that he be incarcerated. They were begging. He was released from custody pending his court appearance, enabling him to commit murder. A Trump administration will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and save American lives. [applause]And I want to thank, by the way, I see all these signs—""Cubans for Trump."" Cubans. I love Cubans. [applause]So they gave me last week the Bay of Pigs Association, right? You know. They gave me their award last week and it was a great honor. And we're gonna fight very hard for the Cubans and we're gonna fight very, very hard for the Hispanics because they have not been properly taken care of.What's happened with the Hispanic population in our country is not right. What's happened with the inner cities of our country, the African-American community, the Hispanic community, is very, very unfair. [applause]Thank you. Thank you.We're going to take care of it. The crime is horrible, the education is terrible, and you can't get a job. We're going to fix the inner cities—we're going to fix the inner cities. Thank you, fellows, that's so good. Blacks for Trump. That's so nice.We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. [applause]That includes total support for homestead air reserve base. A Trump administration will stand in solidarity with the suffering people of Cuba and Venezuela all surrounding Dural—all surrounding Dural against the oppression of the Castro and Maduro regimes, you know what I'm talking about. We will cancel Obama's one-sided Cuban deal made by Executive Order. If we do not get the deal we want, and the deal that people living in Cuba and here deserve[applause]including protecting religious and political freedom, right? I'm honored to have the endorsement of over 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. [applause]You know it's really called peace through strength. Peace through strength, that's what we're going to have, well, hopefully. Have to get rid of ISIS—we're going to get rid of ISIS, don't worry, we're getting rid of ISIS. But we have to get to rebuild our country. We've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East—six trillion dollars. And it's in far worse shape, by a factor of 10, from when we started. Six trillion—we lost lives, the most incredible, great people. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought disaster to Iraq and Syria and Libya. And she empowered Iran, remember, she's got bad judgment. And she unleashed ISIS, came right out of the vacuum. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Frankly, it could lead to World War III and she has no sense. She's got no instinct, but that's decided Hillary and our failed Washington establishment, they've spent that six trillion dollars. I mean, I'd love to have that money back, but I'd much rather have all those lives back—rather have all those lives. [applause]Love to have those lives back. But the Middle East is in bad shape folks, and it's getting worse, totally getting worse. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And these are foreign wars that we don't win—we don't win. We don't win anymore, we don't win with trade, we don't win with wars, we don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again, you watch. We're going to start. [applause]To all Americans I say it's time for new leadership. Just think about what can be accomplished in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. [applause]And she is going to raise your taxes very substantially, I think you know that. [booing]We will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, cancel every illegal Obama executive order, rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. [applause]Provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; we're bringing our education local. [applause]Support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege [applause]and appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]Clinton wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change and wants our lives to revolve around Washington. I wonder if she's going to be there much longer. What do you think? [booing]I don't think so. I don't know. I'm not sure she's going to be there. But she wants—she wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this great country. [applause]I'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. [applause]There is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics, certainly not the media. [booing]Hillary has been there for 30 years and she has accomplished nothing. She's just made things worse. Look at her record. She's the candidate of yesterday; we are the—right? Is that right? We are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans and Democrats and independents and first time voters. And believe me, there are a lot of first time voters that are standing on line right now. [applause]We're asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day. And I understand the other side very well. I've been there for a long time, but I love our country and I understand what has to be done. We are going in the wrong direction, and if we keep going in this direction, we won't have a country any longer. [booing]We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future. With your vote, we are just—think of it—six days away. [applause]This started on June 16th of last year. It's a long time. Seems like a long time ago. But we're six days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. It'll never happen again. It'll never, ever happen. It's not going to happen in four years. When I see Cubans for Trump, it'll never happen again. I'm telling you. This whole thing will never happen again. There's never been a movement like this in the history of our country—there's never been a movement like this.Thank you. Thank you.There has never been a movement like this in the history of our country—it's never happened. Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump have said, it's the single greatest phenomena the have ever seen. We have to close the deal. We have to close—get out and vote. November 8th fine, better if you vote now. Maybe you don't feel good November 8th, you don't want to get outta bed, you gotta get up, you gotta vote.Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. [applause]Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]Get out and vote. God bless you, everybody. Thank you. [applause]","UCSB"
"153",2016-11-07,"Donald Trump","Remarks at J.S Dorton Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina","This is amazing. What a great place. Thank you very much. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. But we should start. Do we agree? [applause]We should start. So they'll come in. They'll come in.First of all I want to thank you. Special, special place. It's a special place with incredible people. In one day, do you believe this? One day we are going to win the great state of North Carolina... [applause]And we are going to win back the White House. [applause]This election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class. You're seeing what's happening. Everybody's watching. Or whether we are ruled by the people. We're going to be ruled by the people, folks. [applause]That is going to be the choice. A failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty, nothing but problems, nothing but losses. Nothing but losses. We don't win anymore as a country. We're going to start winning again. [applause]They get rich by making America poorer in many cases. It's time to reject the media and political elite that has bled our country dry. [applause]And these are among the most dishonest people. They don't give you the truth, folks. They don't give you the truth. [booing]They rarely give you the truth. You know it. And they know it. That's the scary part. They know it.It's time to fight for America. I'm not a politician, I can say proudly. My only special interest is you. It's you. [applause]We're going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you. We're going to bring back the wealth that has been taken from our country. We're going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers. We're going to put them back to work. [applause]The economic policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the entire country.The corrupt Clintons gave us NAFTA. China's too horrible entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the disasters. The job-killing deal with South Korea. That was a Hillary Clinton beauty. And the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will be a total disaster. [booing]That Hillary Clinton said this is the gold standard. And you know what? It is the gold -- she lied. She lied during the debate. She said -- hey, by the way, who won the debate? Did we win that debate? [applause]But she lied during the debate. She lied during the debate. She said it's the gold standard. And then she said she never said it.Don't worry about coal. We're bringing back coal, sir. He's holding up a couple of...[applause]Clean coal. Clean coal. Right? We're going to do clean coal, the miners. The miners are going to be back. Not if Hillary Clinton gets in. The miners, I guess you got to start thinking about something else. But the miners are going to be back. Clean coal. Clean coalYou know, thinking about it, though. Also, people, the press doesn't talk about it. Donna Brazile gets the questions through a debate...[booing]...but then it turns out to be a number of debates. [booing]Who cares about Donna Brazile? She's turned out to be not what people thought. She gets, illegally -- illegally. She gets the questions to the debate. She then takes those questions and gives them to crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing]Now, does crooked Hillary report it? Does she say I shouldn't have these questions or these answers? I think they gave them the answers also, right? No, she doesn't. They doesn't. I wonder if she had -- I wonder if she had the questions in my debates. I don't think so because she didn't do that well. I don't think so. I don't think so. But the years of betrayal will end. And they will end. And they're going to end quickly. They're going to end as of the day we take office, which is going to be very, very soon. [applause]The theft of North Carolina jobs will end. You've taken in harder than most states.Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause]Sadly, it's just been announced that the residents of North Carolina are going to experience massive double-digit premium hikes. Ninety-five...[booing]...of the 100 North Carolina counties will only have one insurer in the Obamacare exchange next year. Lots of luck negotiating.Honestly, it's not going to matter because we're going to win and we're going to terminate it. You're going to have such great health care...[applause]...for much less money. It won't matter. [applause]Premiums are searching. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting.By the way, doctors, they're leaving. They're quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor. He said that I have more accountants than I have nurses, it's so complicated. And deductibles are going through the roof. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down and expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. [booing]I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare, and save health care for every family in North Carolina. [applause]Thank you. Thank you.Thank you. [applause]People are pouring in, folks. They're pouring in.Did you see last night in Michigan the crowd we had? And the crowd we had -- by the way, how about 24,000 maybe 25,000 right next to Fort Brag. You saw that the other night. [applause]And we went to Minnesota. Minnesota's been treated very, very badly. We went to Minnesota where we're doing very well. Everyone said why Minnesota? That doesn't go Republican. It's going Republican this year, I'll tell you. Minnesota. Great place. And you know, you've been watching and you've been seeing and these people are being driven crazy, the dishonest media. We're winning Ohio. We're winning Iowa. We're winning, we think, New Hampshire. We're going to do great in New Hampshire. I hear we're winning North Carolina big... [applause]I hear.We're winning Florida. We're winning Florida, doing really well. Headlines today are on drudge. how well we're doing in Florida. And I think we're going to win the great state of Pennsylvania, I do. Then we're winning plenty of other places. So we have to go. The big key, you have to go. You don't win a rigged system, folks. We're in a rigged system. You got to go. You got to vote. Got to make sure that vote gets registered. Real change also means restoring honesty to our governmentThank you. Thank you. Wow. Great, great spirit.I have a job right next to -- we have a beautiful, beautiful property right next to -- right near Charlotte. You know about it, folks? It's great right? Some of the people. But it's an amazing place. It's an amazing place to work and to live, and we love it. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. [booing]She threatened national security, she sold her office to the highest bidder. And then to cover her tracks...[booing]...she deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena, nothing happens to her. Nothing happens [booing]She's being protected by a totally rigged system -- General James Cartwright. A four-star general. Two weeks ago probably going to jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison. But he said he did it for national security reasons and I can understand that. Go to jail for up to five years. General betrayes, his life was destroyed and here she is she is running for president 25 times worse than anybody has ever dreamt. It's a rigged system. It is a rigged rigged system. [booing]Don't worry, folks. The cameras will never spin around and show this crowd. They never do. They show my face and the two people behind me, not the thousands behind me. They never do. They never do. [applause] [booing]So dishonest. There they are. There they are. My group. Women for Trump. [applause]Women for Trump. [applause]They've been following me, these ladies, for a long time. How are we doing? Are we doing well?Great people. Women for Trump.And now it's up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow. At the ballot box. We're going to win.I think it's a great way of showing what we have to show in light of what's going on with justice in this country. I really do. I think it's a great way. You show it tomorrow. We show it tomorrow. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests. [applause]And folks, I was on the other side for a long time. It's a very good place to be. But I love the country. I love this country. I've really gotten to love the people of this country because I have been everywhere. We have the greatest people on earth. But I love this country. And I couldn't watch it when they made the Iran deal. They gave them $150 billion, a terrorist state. [booing]A state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful. We gave them a path to nuclear weapons. They were ready to collapse. We gave them, remember, $400 billion, right? We gave them $400 million. Then we found out that was -- it wasn't $400 million. It was $1.7 billion in cash. In cash. Do you know what $1.7 billion in cash is? You could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldn't have enough room. How stupid are we to allow this to happen? Our leaders are incompetent. President Obama is campaigning today with Hillary Clinton because she can't campaign. [booing]She can't campaign. [booing]So Obama is taking Air Force One, which costs a fortune. You know he's very much into the environment. And he'll take a massive, old engine 747. Very much into the environment. Very much into the ozone layer. And yet he'll fly that 747 all over the place to campaign for crooked Hillary. And I don't think it's going to work. And she's not getting any crowds. So she gets Beyonce and Jay-Z. I like them. [booing]I like them. [booing]And you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. [applause]It's true. I get far bigger crowds. [applause]Look at this place. I mean, look at the crowds we had in Michigan.By the way, Michigan is in play. It hasn't been in play for Republicans for 30 something years. Michigan is in play because they're tired of watching their car factories be taken out. They're tired of losing their jobs to Mexico. Ford. Ford right now moved all of its small car production to Mexico. They're building the biggest plants in the world in Mexico. And Michigan has been complaining about it for five years to Mexico. [applause]No, we're going to have some -- tomorrow's going to be a very historic day. I really believe that. I think it's going to show -- I think it's going to be a Brexit plus, plus, plus. Does that make sense? [applause]Plus, plus, plus. [applause]It will be amazing. It will be amazing.I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we're all about to say. This is a phrase, I told you. I didn't like it. I thought it was hokie. But it's not hokie. It's called ""drain the swamp.""We're going to go to Washington. We're going to drain the swamp. Can't believe it.I told the story. I hated that expression. I said no way I'm going to say that, no way. That's so hokie. And I said it. The place went crazy.Then I said it to another place. It went crazier. Then I said it with more confidence because you know confidence is -- and it went wild. Now I love the expression. I think it was genius. Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. [laughter]Is there any place better to be than a Trump rally? Are we having fun? [applause]Are we having fun? No? And I don't have a guitar. And I don't have a piano. All we have is great concepts for our country, which is the most important thing. Because frankly, when people get on stage, and they're entertainers, and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for Hillary Clinton. And by the way, they use the dirtiest language the other night. And it was -- many of the people left. You know they're political people. They heard words they've never heard before. They left. So the place was half empty by the time -- actually, it never got full, even with them. Then it was pretty much empty midway through. And then most of the people just left. And when Hillary got up there was practically -- she might as well just have started with a few people. It would've been easier. [laughter]But you know she hears those words. I won't use the words. I won't even address the words. Because if I do the crooked media will say ""did you hear what Donald Trump said today?"" [booing]But honestly -- yes. [booing]Those words were disgusting. If I ever said those words that Jay-Z said or that Beyonce said the other night, you know what would happen to me? The reinstitution of the electric chair. It would be -- how about if I got the answers to the debate? Or if I got the questions? Supposing instead of Hillary getting the questions to the debate, which is cheating. She's a cheat. She is a cheat. She never reported it. She is a cheat. So supposing instead of her -- supposing somebody gave Donald Trump the questions to the debate. Headlines all over the world. He must withdraw from the race. You don't even hear anything about crooked Hillary. She got the questions. To me that's such a big difference. Some people say, my people, oh don't mention that, it's just -- I say to me it's a big deal.It's a big deal. But it's not a big deal for the dishonest media to say. They don't want to report it. But just think about it, supposing it was us.At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Bring them back to America. [applause]And by the way, you have a great governor. Support your governor. He's a great guy. [applause] Where is he? He's here someplace. He's a great guy and he's in a tough fight. And he's going to win that fight. But he's a great guy. So hopefully you'll support your governor. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and his lovely wife, Hillary. [booing]Well think of it. Think of it. Think of the numbers of jobs.Here's the one that gets me the most. Two things get me the most. Two things that just don't seem real. Because we're going to take care of our veterans, right? Like big league. Because our veterans are great. But two statistics I can't believe. Twenty-two suicides a day for our veterans.Think of it. You wouldn't think that's possible. Because they're treated so badly. They wait on line for six, seven, eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescription. But two numbers I don't -- it just doesn't make sense. Twenty- two suicides a day for our veterans. OK? It doesn't make sense.And here's another one. America has lost 70,000 factories. Now I thought they meant 700 or 7,000 maybe. It's 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary Clinton-backed disaster. Think of it though. [booing]Think of what 70,000 factories is.So those are the two numbers. They just don't seem to be real. Sad numbers. Sad numbers. Especially the vets, to be honest with you.We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world. There's never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the United States. Our jobs are fleeing. Our companies are being taken. And leaving. And leaving. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America. And we will stop the jobs from leaving North Carolina. Believe me. [applause]If a company wants to fire their workers and leave, as an example North Carolina, and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States through what will be a very strong border, by the way. We will make them pay a 35 percent tax on every product that they ship back here. [applause]And here's what's going to happen. They're not going to leave. They're not going to leave.Now your politicians, some of them don't understand it. Some only cut taxes for the middle class. And by the way, Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes, and you know that [booing]Substantially.So one of the highest taxes in the world, she wants to raise your taxes. Same old story.We will unleash the power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. Our plan will end the EPA intrusion into your family farms, and stop double taxation of a family farm at that. [applause]We will cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations. Billions and billions of dollars. And we have no idea what they do with that money. I actually have a pretty good idea. You're not going to like it. And use that -- we're going to use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. [applause]And we will rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community, the Hispanic community...[applause]...have had such lies told to them. They live -- many, many people living in the inner cities of our country, they're getting worse and worse. The crime is unbelievable. You can't walk to the store and get a loaf of bread. Often you get shot. Chicago. Thousands and thousands of shootings since Jan. 1. You read it. The murder rate of the United States is the highest it's been in 45 years. The dishonest media doesn't tell you that stuff because they want you to like Obama. They want you to think Obama is doing a good job. And he's not. [booing] And he's not. [booing]And he's not. [booing]So you live in the inner cities. You're African-American. You're Hispanic. The schools are no good. There are no jobs. And it's totally unsafe. And I say I will fix it. What the hell do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it. [applause]We are all going to fix it. [applause]We're going to fix it. We're going to bring back jobs. We're going to bring back safety. And we're going to get really good education going. There is tremendous potential, folks, in the inner cities, believe me, tremendous potential. We will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. [booing]Unbelievable. It's unbelievable. [booing]Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. And you don't even know where they're going. Your government doesn't even know where they're going. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program...[applause]...and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause]Have no choice. [applause]We have no choice.AUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA. TRUMP: We have no choice.But we're going to work because we all have hearts and it's a big problem, caused to a large extent by Obama and Hillary Clinton.The migration, caused to a large extent -- ISIS was caused by them. They left a big vacuum. There was no ISIS when she first served as secretary. There was no ISIS. She created it. Now she stands at the debate, ""I will fight ISIS."" She's got no chance. She's going to fight nobody. She wants to go home and go to sleep. [laughter]Unbelievable. She's going to fight ISIS.So we're going to build -- we're going to build, we are going to build safe havens. We're going to have the Gulf States who have nothing but money, they're going to pay for it. We have $20 trillion in debt. And if it's OK, I'm not going to spend a penny. We have $20 trillion in debt. And we still have to rebuild our country. You know it's one thing like when you buy a company and it's got some debt. We have $20 trillion in debt. But the country's a mess. The roads are bad. The bridges are bad. The schools are bad. The hospitals are bad. The tunnels are bad. Everything's bad. The military needs massive amounts of money. So we have all this horrible debt. It's one thing if we had it and everything's in tippy top shape. I like to say. You know I like the properties. Give me them. I want them. Give me them. But we have them and they're a mess. And we have $20 trillion, which is far too much. So we're going to get it down. And we're going to rebuild our country. We have so many things we're going to be doing. We're going to be a rich nation again. [applause]A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. [applause]And yes, we will build a great wall and Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent. [applause]One hundred percent. [applause]Mexico will pay. If you look at the incredible -- if you look at the incredible deficits we have with Mexico, it's unbelievable. What we have, the cost of that wall is peanuts, is peanuts compared to the numbers you're talking about on trade with Mexico. And the numbers with China? Trade deficit? I mean we will have a trade deficit with China of close to $500 billion this year. We are going to lose in worldwide trade of goods, we're going to lose worldwide close to $800 billion. What are we doing? You really ask, who is negotiating these deals? Where do these people come? You know where they come from? They're political hacks.You're dealing with the smartest people in the world. You have Chinese people, every -- you have from Japan, you have from all these other countries. They put their smartest and the best. We put political hacks that don't know what they're doing. So we have an -- and we have the greatest in the world. We have the greatest business people. We have the greatest negotiators. We don't use them. We don't use them. We use political people. Some of them got their job because they give campaign contributions. [booing]We're going to get it straightened out, folks, starting tomorrow. Go vote. Go vote. [applause]Right?My women. Hillary supports totally open borders. There goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered violently by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. [applause]We will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens. [applause]We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton Defense sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military. [applause]There have been few times in our history where we've needed it more, few times. North Carolina will be at the very center of this effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. [applause]Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful new fighters from Seymour Johnson.And we're going to have more battalions. You know the Marines are way, way off in terms of numbers. You know that. I know. Has there ever been? Yes, there have been. But rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now. The world hates us. The world hates us. So we're going to increase -- thank you. We're going to increase Marine battalions at Camp Lejeune. I've been to Camp Lejeune...[applause]They make major new investments. Where I was the other night, right next to it. I guess like 25,000 or 27,000 people at Fort Bragg. [applause]Great people. All soldiers are tough. A couple of them shook my hand. It was like oy, whoa. Take it easy, fellas. They are tough cookies. They are strong. They don't know how strong they are. These are great people. And new military technologies will be researched and developed right here at the Research Triangle. Right here. [applause]I'm honored to have the endorsements of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. And every day those numbers go up big league. Big league. Show Less TextAnd I asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by Fort Bragg. I asked them. I said fellas, let me ask you a question. They want to take over Mosul. Am I getting something wrong? Whatever happened to the element of surprise for us? I'm talking to admirals now and generals. That's what they do. I do other things. But you know it's called like common sense.You got to say we've made a lot of right calls. I said why is it that four months away from going into Mosul they're announcing ""we are going into Mosul?"" We're going into Mosul because we want to get the leaders of ISIS and they're staying in Mosul. And then three months they're saying ""we are going in, in three months to Mosul."" And then we're going in, in two months. And every time I hear, I put my hands, I go like this. I don't want to hear this, please. And as you know, they've been met with tremendous resistance, much more than they would've beenAnd I guarantee you this. I can't say it with certainty, only about 99.9 percent, OK? I can't say -- nothing's 100 percent. Even our victory isn't 100 percent. But it's starting to look pretty close, isn't it? [applause]Those numbers. Those numbers. [applause]Oh, these guys are unhappy. Look at them. They're not happy. They are unhappy campers. Starting to look good. [booing]Starting to look good.But wouldn't it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago. Then they have last -- two weeks ago they go next week we're getting ready to raid. The leaders all left. They're gone. And the other people are putting up much more of a fight. Horrible. They're using human shields. It's a horrible situation. I mean it's hell. It's hell.But why do we just watch what's going on. Hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East that we never win. We just keep fighting and fighting. It's like a hose. The money just keeps pouring out. We never win. And now the Middle East is in worse shape by far than it's ever been. We have the Great Migration, the whole thing. They've dragged -- thank you. [applause]I don't even want to look. I'll get myself. I don't want to look. [laughter]They'll make it -- I won't even say I love you too because they're going to make it a major headline if I said that. World's most dishonest people. The world's really dishonest people. [booing]They dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. Shipped our jobs and wealth all over -- right open at home. You ever notice we send these incredible troops, so much death, so much injury, in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of. And yet we don't protect our own borders. Isn't it an incredible thing? That will change starting tomorrow. [applause]Because from now on it's going to be America first, America first. [applause]So just in summing up, to all Americans I say it's time for a real leadership and time for change. We have to have change. [applause]Can you imagine having Hillary for four years? [booing]I'm being serious about that. I wouldn't want to watch the news every night.I mean look at what she's done with the e-mails as an example. I mean did you ever see a mess like this? Did you ever see -- of course the FBI -- the director was obviously under tremendous pressure. So they went through 650,000 e-mails in eight days. Right. So sad what's going on. And she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from Congress. I mean that's a crime. What happened? That's a crime. You don't even need the new stuff. She shouldn't be allowed to run. Shouldn't be allowed to run.Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. [applause]We're going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan.And Hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially.We're going to save and protect your Social Security and Medicare. [applause]And Hillary is going to cut your Social Security and really injure Medicare. That's what's going to happen.We will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation. We'll cancel every illegal Obama executive order. [applause]By the way, a man that loves this state. It's his birthday today. Billy Graham, 98. [applause]The father of Franklin. Billy Graham. What a great one, right? Ninety-eight years old. He is a fantastic man. Franklin's a fantastic man. And it's so wonderful to have support of people like that. We're going to protect religious liberty...[applause]...rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. We're going to take care of our veterans. [applause]We will provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We move our education locally. [applause]We will support the men and women -- these are great people, the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]We're going to save our Second Amendment. [applause]And appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]This sounds so good to me because I started this on June 16th of last year because I couldn't stand when I looked at what was going on with our country, I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand it. Coming down the escalator, right, with Melania. Coming down that escalator June 16 of last year. And they were all saying -- there were all the dishonest pundits. Actually a few of them thought I had a hell of a chance if you want to know the -- the smarter ones. But they were all saying but he's not involved with -- I've been involved with politics all my life, on the other side. But I've been involved. We had 17 people -- by the way, one of the great people in here tonight, Mike Huckabee. Where is Mike Huckabee? [applause]He's such -- is he here someplace? He is here. He is so great. Mike, wherever you are, come on out because you are great. I just saw him.But we had 17 people of great talent. Ben Carson endorsed us. Mike...[applause]Mike endorsed us. Tremendous -- I mean very talented people. And one by one by one -- and they used to say -- well I remember we were down to like 13 or 14. In one state I got 49 percent. And one of these clowns said ""he has not reached the 50 percent mark."" I got 49 percent with like 14 people. How do you get 49 percent with 14 people? And they said he hasn't reached the 50 percent mark. They're very dishonest people. So we ended up with 17 people, right? Don't forget that's hard because nobody else ever had a field that big or that violent, or that violent.And we have a couple that didn't endorse and that's too bad. You know they signed a pledge. They didn't honor it. But...[booing]But -- no. But for the most part...[booing]No. For the most part they were very honorable. But it was rough. They said it was the roughest primary every. I would say this is the roughest election.You know the NFL ratings are way down. You know why? Because everyone's watching this. It's actually tougher. It's actually tougher. [applause]Everyone's watching. The NFL ratings are way down. A lot of people say it's because of this.So you had 17 people. You've came down -- but we've got -- and this is a tribute to everybody in this room. We got the highest number of voters in the history of the Republican primary system. [applause]So well done. [applause]That's a long time. You know, starting with Honest Abe Lincoln, right. That's a long time. I got more than Honest Abe. That's really the only thing I did better than Honest Abe. Honest Abe was pretty -- he was pretty good. So here's the beauty. You have one day until the election. And it's not even one day. It's a half a day. To make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true. You have one magnificent chance. And honestly, in four years it's over, folks. There has never been a movement like this. Even these dishonest people in the media say there has never -- Bill O'Reilly. He said it's the single greatest political phenomena that he's witnessed in his life. That's a pretty good statement. [applause]But others have said it. Others have said it. Others have said it. And it's not going to happen again. It won't be able to happen again. Four years it'll never happen. So you got to get out there and you got to vote. Got to get out. Somebody said what you've done has never been done before. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. I said believe me, it matters. No, they said that. It'll be down in the history books. I said you know what? You may be right about that. But if we don't win I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy. Wow do I -- you need energy for this. The single greatest waste of time, energy and money. I have over $100 million. That's a lot of money that I don't take in from the special interests because I don't need it. That's nice.And we have the biggest Internet -- you know the small donors? The small donors are giving us money at record clips. I think we had $82 million and then we had close to $100 million. And it comes in. And I think the average was like $61 each. I love those people. Those are people that love this country. [applause]And usually that's for the Democrats. You know in all fairness, that's usually for the Democrats to do that. But we're beating everybody. Nobody's seen anything like what we're doing. So we don't want to blow it. We don't want to waste it. Go vote. Go vote. Because believe me, if we don't win, all of us, honestly we've all wasted our time, I'll be honest. Because nothing's going to happen. They may say good things about us as a movement. Won't mean a damn thing, folks. You got to go out. We got to vote and we got to win. Change. [applause]Change.So you have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system that you're witnessing today, and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in this nation. Do not let this opportunity slip away. We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. [applause]And we're fighting, we're fighting to bring us all together as Americans. We're a very divided country. People don't realize we are an unbelievably divided country. We're going to come together. Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause]Just imagine.I'm asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life. [applause]Because if we win tomorrow, we will be able to make America wealthy again, to make America strong again, to make America safe again, and to make America great again. God bless you, everybody. [applause]Thank you. God bless you. Thank you, North Carolina. [applause]Thank you, folks. Thank you. [applause]","UCSB"
"154",2016-11-09,"Donald Trump","Remarks in New York City Accepting Election as the 45th President of the United States","Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. [applause]Sorry to keep you waiting; complicated business; complicated. [applause]Thank you very much. [applause]I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. [applause]She congratulated us — it's about us — on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she — she fought very hard.Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. [applause]I mean that very sincerely. [applause]Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. [applause]It's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. [applause]For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people...[laughter]...I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. [applause]As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families. [applause]It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will. [applause]Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. [applause]Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well — tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. [applause]We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.We will also finally take care of our great veterans. [applause]They've been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. [applause]We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. [applause]We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. [applause]We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory.First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. [applause]Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents.I also want to thank my sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And, where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert — my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? [applause]My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's OK. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred. Great guy. Fantastic guy. [applause]Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters; great, unbelievable parents.To Melania and Don...[applause]...and Ivanka...[applause]...and Eric and Tiffany and Baron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. [applause]This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all.And Lara, unbelievable job, unbelievable.Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much.What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people.And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got — we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been — it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. [applause]Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. That Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he? Rudy.Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. [applause]Thank you, Chris.The first man, first senator, first major, major politician, and let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get: Senator Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? [applause]Great man.Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? [laughter]Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here.Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats: Dr. Ben Carson. Where is Ben? [applause]Where is Ben?And by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah — thank you very much.General Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? [applause]And General Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign. And they're special people and it's really an honor. We have 22 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. We have just tremendous people.A very special person who believed me and, you know, I'd read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is...[crosstalk]That's right. How did you possibly guess? So let me tell you about Reince, and I've said this. I said, Reince — and I know it, I know. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Reince is a superstar. But I said, ""They can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win,"" because you can't be called a superstar — like Secretariat — if Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful bronze bust at the track at Belmont.But I'll tell you, Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest-working guy. And in a certain way, I did this — Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince. [applause]Boy oh boy oh boy. It's about time you did this, Reince. My God. [applause]Say a few words. No, come on, say something.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump. [applause]Thank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God.The President-elect: We will do a great job. [applause]I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years... [applause]...you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that — you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do and I can...[crosstalk]Thank you very much.And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. [applause]We're going to get to work immediately for the American people. And we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You'll be so proud. Again, it's my honor. It was an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period. And I love this country. [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]Thank you to Mike Pence.

<date:""2016-08-01"">
<(JOINED IN PROGRESS) HILLARY CLINTON (D)>
<PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: To have a chance to stand before America and to tell their stories, because America is story after story. And what I want is to provide the opportunity and the support so that every single American can live his or her best story, can make the most of your own God-given potential. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)>
<CLINTON:> And after the convention was over, starting Friday morning, Tim Kaine and his wonderful wife, Anne, and Bill I and I got on a bus and started traveling across Pennsylvania into Ohio. <CROSSTALK>
<CLINTON:> We visited factories, small towns, bigger cities. We met with so many hardworking people who told us their stories, and they proved every day that Donald Trump is wrong. America is not weak. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> I agree with Warren. This is the greatest nation on Earth and our best days are still ahead of us. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> Now, that doesn't mean we don't have challenges and problems. Of course we do, right here at home and around the world. [18:20:00] But I don't believe there is anything that Americans can't do if we make up our minds, because you know why? We are stronger together. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> But, as Warren said, too many people haven't gotten a raise since the great crash. There's too much inequality and too little opportunity. Washington is paralyzed by special interests and big money. But don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes if we make up our minds to solve our problems. And don't believe anyone who tells you, ""I alone can fix it."" <LAUGHTER> <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> When Donald Trump said that in his convention speech, I did a bit of a mental double-take. I listened to that speech, 75 minutes of it, and it was like he was talking about a different country, forgetting about everyone in America who gets up every day and works together, people who make a difference every single day. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> He's forgetting our troops on the front lines. He's forgetting police officers and firefighters who run toward danger. He's forgetting about doctors and nurses who save lives, and teachers who change lives. He's forgetting about unions who fight for working families and communities that pull together through hard times. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> I grew up in the Midwest. I was born in Chicago, raised outside of Chicago. My dad was a small businessman. I mean really small. It was mostly just him and occasionally my mother, my brothers and me, and sometimes he would hire helpers to get one of his orders out because he printed fabrics to be made into draperies, and he had a print plant with long tables. He was a very self-reliant man. But I don't think he, for a minute, through his growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, through his service as a chief petty officer in the Navy, through his work and business or his raising our family, ever thought to himself, I alone can fix it. That's just not the way we were raised. We were raised to get together. We were raised to follow up on the extraordinary example of our founders 240 years ago in Philadelphia, who came together. You see that across Nebraska. You see people working. I have been in Omaha. I have visited projects, schools, other kinds of nonprofits and institutions where people are working together. That's what we do in America. We see a problem and we say, we will fix it together. And that's what we're going to do when we get the White House to move us forward in the direction we need to go. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> Now, I know how hard the great recession was. It was a terrible time, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And people in Nebraska worked hard to come back. I think it was a terrible moment. It could have gotten even worse. I believe that a lot of difficult decisions had to be made, and we have come back from that terrible financial crisis. Thanks to the hard work of Nebraskans, Americans and President Obama, we got out of the ditch we were in. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> So, I think if we're going to solve the problems we have, we ought to be really clear about where we have come from. We now have 15 million new jobs that have been created in the last seven-and-a-half years. We now have 20 million more Americans who have access to health care. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> [18:25:15]
<CLINTON:> We have the highest percentage ever in our history of young people walking across graduation stages to get their high school diplomas. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> So I know we have made progress, but I know we shouldn't be satisfied. As Americans, we always have to be asking ourselves what can we do better, how can we make more progress, how can we help more people? We're still facing tough challenges that developed long before the recession and they have stayed with us. The economy is not working the way it should for everyone. <CROSSTALK>
<CLINTON:> Starting in Iowa back in April of 2015 until the convention this week, I have met so many people who tell me, you know, they don't expect a handout. They don't even expect, you know, life to be easy. But they don't think it should be this hard. It shouldn't be that people feel like they're out there on their own, like no one cares about them, that they're not respected, that the dignity of their job is not something that we all support. I know a lot of people who feel that way. I bet there are some in this gymnasium who feel that way. Well, here's what I want you to know. You deserve a president who will get up every single day in the White House and do everything she can to give you the chance you deserve to have. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> And I will quickly add, as important as it is to have someone who gets what you're going through, I think it's also really important that that person tells you what her plans are for producing results. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> So, if you saw what I said on Thursday night, let me give you the short, punchier version. And it starts by making clear we do have to rewrite the rules so that our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> My overriding mission as president will be to do everything I can to help our country create more jobs with rising incomes. I believe anyone willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well, enough to support a family. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> So, in my first 100 days, we are going to break through the gridlock in Washington and make the biggest investment in new good-paying jobs since World War II. We are going to make the boldest investment in American infrastructure since the highway system. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> Warren read you some of the quotes from Donald Trump. Well, he has said so many things that I profoundly, vehemently disagree with. And, for the life of me, I don't know why someone runs to be president of the United States who thinks and says we never win anymore, our country is full of losers. Well, he could not be more wrong. We are going to fix and build the roads, the bridges, the tunnels, the ports, the airports, the water systems we need. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> And I want to say a particular word to any of you here from rural Nebraska. We are going to bring diverse economic development to rural communities to support our farmers and others in small towns who keep America going. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> And one specific way we will do that is to make sure we have an electric grid that can take and distribute energy from clean renewable sources - <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> In fact, I know because I've seen them in the crowd. There are few people from Iowa here today. And your neighbor Iowa is already getting one-third of its electricity from clean energy, primarily wind energy. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> And what I love about them is they're also giving farmers extra income for hosting the turbines on their farm, and they are taking abandoned factories and actually assembling the wind turbines, putting people to work in Iowa to produce the energy for Iowa. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> The other thing we're going to do is finish the job of building out broadband so everybody in America, no matter where you live, has access to the Internet. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> <ENDS IN PROGRESS>","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-05"">
<CLINTON:> Good morning. I am so pleased to be here, I want to thank you all for the invitation, for the introduction, to everyone associated with NABJ and NAHJ. I want to just mark the moment because you we're created in this hotel. I don't know if there are any original founders but if there are could you all stand up and we could give you some recognition. I am delighted to thank you for the important work you do everyday and now more then ever, we need you to keep holding leaders and candidates accountable. And in the tradition of path-breaking journalists like Ethel Payne and Ruben Salazar, we need you to make sure that America's front pages, and nightly new casts, and online information reflects the great diversity of our nation. Someone that I had the privilege of knowing, the late great Bob Maynard, former owner of the Oakland Tribune once said... <APPLAUSE> And I quote Bob, ""It is in seeing ourselves whole that we can begin to see ways of working out our differences of understanding our similarities and becoming a more cohesive nation,"" and that is what you do everyday. Helping us to see ourselves as whole -- I'm looking forward to our discussion, which I'm sure will cover a wide range of issues. But I want to take just a few minutes to focus on a challenge that doesn't get enough attention on the campaign trial, although I've been trying, and that is how do we expand economic opportunity for African-Americans and Latinos across America. And you know very well -- it's been said -- that when the economy catches a cold, communities of color get pneumonia. The great recession hit our whole country hard but the toll was especially difficult for black and Latino families. Black wealth was cut in half, for Latinos it dropped 66 percent. That represented decades even generations of hard work, and during these past 18 months people across our country have described to me how hard it's been to get back on their feet in an economy that is still not working the way we all want to see it, and barriers of systemic racism makes that even harder. Now I believe that President Obama does not get the credit he deserves for leading us out of the great recession. <APPLAUSE> And I like to remind people, he had nothing to do with creating it in the first place. <APPLAUSE> He came into office in this worst of all financial crises since the Great Depression -- was handed to him. And I think if you fairly look at the record, you have to conclude that his leadership saved us from a Great Depression.
<CLINTON:> So as bad a things became -- 9 million jobs lost, 5 million homes lost, $13 trillion in family wealth wiped out -- as bad as it was, there's no telling how far down we would have gone without his leadership. So we are out of the ditch that we were in and now we've got to do even more. We've got to build on the progress we've made, 15 million new jobs in the last seven and a half years, 20 million people now have health insurance who did not have it before he became president. So we've got to have the will and the plans together to move forward. That's why I've proposed a comprehensive new commitment to African American and Latino communities to make serious, sustained investments to create more good paying jobs. To help families build and rebuild wealth, to support Black and Latino owned small businesses. For me these aren't just economic issues, they're part of a long, continuing struggle for civil rights. Rosa Parks opened up every seat on the bus, now we've got to expand economic opportunities so everyone can afford the fare and we have to make sure the bus route reaches every neighborhood and connects families with safe, affordable housing and good jobs. <APPLAUSE> Sylvia Mendez and Ruby Bridges helped desegregate our schools, now we've got to help every family afford the books, computers and internet access that our kids need to learn in the 21st century. And so in my first 100 days as president, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new good paying jobs since World War II. That includes jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small businesses and infrastructure. If we invest in infrastructure now we will not only create jobs today, we will lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. We're going to also focus on creating jobs and communities where unemployment remains stubbornly high after generations of underinvestment and neglect. I'm a big fan of Congressman Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 plan, steering 10 percent of federal investment to neighborhoods where 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 years. We need that kind of focused, targeted investment in urban places, rural places, wherever Americans have been left out and left behind. We're also going to invest $20 billion in creating jobs for young people. There's a big gap here. The unemployment rate among Latino and African American youth is significantly higher than for Whites. You know it's hard to write a resume if you have nothing to put on it. We're going to help our young people get that first job, so they can get that second job, so they can build a good, solid middle class life that will give them and their families a better future. We're also going to do more to help Black and Latino entrepreneurs get access to capital so they have a real chance at turning their ideas into thriving businesses. Now I think that's not only good for those entrepreneurs, it's good for their families, their workers and their communities. Additionally, as part of our end to end reform of the criminal justice system, we're going to help people succeed when they return home from jail or prison. We're going to ban the box so they can be judged by their skills and talents, not by their pasts. And we will dedicate $5 billion to provide training and support to returning citizens so they can get a good paying job. And in my first 100 days, I'm going to introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. <APPLAUSE> That's not only the right thing to do, every independent analysis shows it will add hundreds of billions of dollars to our economy. It will also keep families together. We need to bring hard working people out of the shadows. America has always been a place where people from around the world work hard and apply their talents to American growth and innovation in pursuit of their own dreams. So we're going to do everything we can to get this done.
<CLINTON:> We need to build an economy and a future that every American can be proud of and be a part of; an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That will be my mission as president. These are just some of the highlights of our plan. I hope you will go to my website, hillaryclinton.com, to read the details, including how we are going to pay for everything I have proposed. And of course, I hope you will compare what I'm proposing to what my opponent is talking about. Now here's one measure that you could use for that comparison. An independent economist recently calculated that if my agenda for jobs and growth is put into place, our economy would create at least 10.4 million jobs within four years. We actually think it could be more than that. Now, this economist also ran the numbers on Donald Trump, including his disastrous and inhumane plan to round up and deport millions of hard working immigrants. The result, according to Mark Zandi, who was the economic advisor to John McCain during his 2008 run for the Presidency. The result of Trump's plans would be a lengthy recession, with 3.4 million jobs lost. Now of course, Donald Trump's problems go far beyond economics. At every turn, he stokes division and resentment. He says horrible things about one group of Americans after another. He's hearkening back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the ugliest impulses of our society. You know the list, you've reported on it. He started this campaign by describing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. He re-tweets white nationalists. He says a distinguished Federal judge can't be trusted because he is of Mexican heritage. He talks about banning Muslims from coming to the United States, a land built on religious freedom. And yes, he also talks about curtailing press freedom as well. We need to stand up as a country and say that Donald Trump doesn't represent who we are and what we believe. That is what my campaign, what Tim Kaine and I and everyone supporting us is doing everyday. And we're going to keep at it. Because I believe, with all my heart, that America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump. We just launched an all Spanish twitter account, because we want to bring as many Americans as possible into this conversation. We've opened offices in every state, because we want to compete everywhere. We want to bring our message and our vision to all corners of our country. But we can't do it alone. Everyone, Republican, Democrat, and Independent, needs to stand up and speak out. Now, I think, journalists have a special responsibility to our democracy in a time like this. As Ida B. Wells once said, people must know before they can act, and there is no educator to compare to the press. Now, many of you are showing the way. It's a badge of honor when Jorge Ramos gets thrown out of a press conference for challenging Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE> Or when another news organization gets banned for reporting what he says. As Jorge said, the best journalism happens when you take a stand, when you denounce injustice. So, I hope you'll keep calling it, like you see it. Keeping holding all of us accountable. You know, I have laid out all these plans. And I'm well aware that I have been sometimes made fun of, for putting out these plans about the economy, and education and criminal justice reform and healthcare and gun safety measures and all the rest of it. But I do have this old fashioned idea, when you run for President you ought to tell the voters of America what you would do as President. So, I am going to keep telling you what I would do, because I want you to hold me accountable, press and citizen alike. Because the stakes are as high as they've ever been in our lifetimes. And we all have to do our part. So, thank you for what you do everyday. Thank you for inviting me to address you today. And I look forward to taking some of your questions. Thank you all very much.<APPLAUSE>
<UNKNOWN: Please welcome moderators, Kristen Welker, White House Correspondent for NBC news, and Lori Montenegro, National Correspondent for Telemundo. (APPLAUSE)>
<WELKER: Thank you. I really appreciate it. Good afternoon to all of you. What an honor to be here. And, it's fantastic to see so many people gathered here for this great conversation we're going to have with Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, thank you for being here today. We really appreciate it. Usually I am on the campaign trail with Secretary Clinton and we're at a very crowded event, so it's great to be able to have this conversation this afternoon.>
<MONTENEGRO: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for accompanying us. You know, so many questions, so little time, so I think we should just get right to it.>
<CLINTON:> Great.
<MONTENEGRO: You alluded to the topic that I want to ask you about. Latinos are very much concerned about the economy. They are concerned about education. They also believe in trustworthiness. I want to start with a topic that, I believe, will result, could, you know, tell the future of it after this election - it's immigration reform. Many Latinos are discouraged by the lack of immigration reform. They believe their vote has been taken for granted. We know what your position is. But, what I would like for you to do is to walk us through the steps.>
<CLINTON:> Right.
<MONTENEGRO: How will you get immigration reform, something that President Obama was not able to do, so that Latinos can believe that something is going to happen, that their vote, again, is not being taken for granted considering that the House, at least the House, will remain under Republican control?>
<CLINTON:> It's a great question, and it's one that I, obviously, have given much thought to because I am determined that we are going to achieve comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. So, here is how I see it - first of all, we are going to start immediately. I want this to be a clear, high priority for my administration. We will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can do so. I am hoping that the outcome of the election, which I am working hard to ensure a victory, will send a clear message to our Republican friends that it's time for them to quit standing in the way of immigration reform. If you remember, after the 2012 election, the Republican National Committee did what they called an autopsy of their loss and concluded that they could not continue to deny the importance of immigration reform, and they urged Republicans running for office to get on board. Now, that hasn't turned out the way that they seemed to have hoped. We have, instead, a Republican nominee who has been virulently anti- immigrant. But, there's nothing like winning to change minds. And, I think, number one, we have a good chance of having a Democratic Senate if everybody does what I hope they will do and vote for Democratic candidates for the Senate. I believe we will pick up some seats in the House and at least, if not take it back, narrow the numbers. If we move in the Senate and then we demand that there be a vote in the House, because I am convinced that if the bipartisan bill that had been achieved in the Senate - remember when Marco Rubio was for it and people worked hard and achieved it? If it had been allowed to come for a vote in the House, it would have passed. So, I view the political landscape as increasingly favorable to us making this happen. I will also defend the President's executive actions. I, like you, was disappointed with the Supreme Court decision, but remember what it did, it sent the case back to be tried. It did not determine the case. So, DACA and DAPA are still alive. Trump has said one of his first acts as President would be to eliminate every executive order that President Obama has signed, including those on immigration issues. So, I will defend DACA and DAPA while I work vigorously for immigration reform.
<CLINTON:> I have proposed an Office of Immigrant Affairs for the White House so that we are able to answer questions and provide information and help people. I will take a very hard look at the deportation priorities. My priority are violent criminals, people suspected of any kind of connection to terrorism, not hard working mothers and fathers and people who go to work, help support this economy, pay $12 billion a year into Social Security, so we will take a hard look at that. We will close private detention centers, just like I want to end private prisons. We're going to close private detention centers. So, I have a very active agenda and we're going to be moving on it and I believe - and you know, obviously it depends upon the outcome of this election - which is why it's so important to register more voters. My campaign is trying to register 3 million more voters, convince people to turn out, because we're going to start early and we're going to be tenacious and absolutely committed to getting a positive result. I think the chances, once we win, will improve dramatically.
<MONTENEGRO: Madam Secretary, you spoke about the deportations. President Obama, some call the deporter-in-chief, you have alluded already to your priority will be criminals, but how do you walk balk the deportations? They're people who are not criminals that are deported daily from this country. How do you walk back the deportations, comply with the law, and not inherit the title of deporter-in-chief, and at the same time, all these steps to help mobilize the Latino community to the polls, many who still believe that their vote is taken for granted in 2008 and 2012, and then we have the e-mails from WikiLeaks that say that are the loyalty brand of the party?>
<CLINTON:> Well look, I think that the President was committed to immigration reform. It's one of the reasons we got the bi-partisan bill passed in the Senate. And what we didn't get though was enough political pressure to turn that bill into a voting issue in the 2010 midterm election. And here's one of my frustrations: people turn out to vote for Presidential elections, and then often don't for midterm elections. So, we lost - we lost a lot of the leverage because we lost the House of Representatives. So, nothing happens easily or quickly in modern politics in America, but here is what I know. As I have said, we are not going to be deporting hard working people and break-up families. I've been on record for a year-and-a- half about this and that will be how I direct the Department of Homeland Security to act. We are going to push on immigration reform and I will need, not only a considerable vote in November, but I will need people across our country to make it clear to their elected representatives that they're going to be held accountable for how they are going to act on immigration reform. We put enough organizing and political effort into this, I am optimistic and I believe we can get this done. But it won't happen simply because we want it. And I can only say that I will give you my very best efforts and I will do everything I can to help elect a Democratic Senate. I've already talked to some of my former colleagues in the Senate. This will be fast-tracked. We already know what can pass the Senate because it happened just a few years ago. And if we then put enough pressure on the House, and do everything we can to really force them to have to take what the Senate passes, I think the outcome will be very different this time. That's my goal and that's what I'm going to do every thing I can to achieve.
<MONTENEGRO: Thank you Madam Secretary.>
<WELKER: Madam Secretary, your poll numbers went way up this week, and yet, the e-mail controversy was still in the headlines. So, I wanted to give you the opportunity to respond. This week you told two separate news organizations that FBI Director James Comey said quote, ""My answers were truthful, and that what I said is consistent with what I have told the American people."" That assertion, as you know, has been debunked by multiple news organizations which point out that Director Comey did say there's no indication that you lied to the FBI. But he didn't weigh-in on whether or not you were truthful to the American people. So my question for you is, are you mischaracterizing Director Comey testimony? And is this not undercutting your efforts to rebuild trust with the American people?>
<CLINTON:> Well Kristin, I appreciate your asking that because I was pointing out in both of those instances that the Director Comey had said that my answers in my FBI interview were truthful. That's really the bottom line here. And I have said on -- during the interview and in many other occasions over the past months, that what I told the FBI -- which he said was truthful -- is consistent with what I have said publicly. So I may have short circuited it and for that I -- you know, will try to clarify because I think -- you know, Chris Wallace and I we're probably talking past each other be -- because of course he could only talk to what I had told the FBI and I appreciated that. Now I have acknowledged repeatedly that using two e-mail accounts was a mistake I -- and I take responsibility for that, but I do think you know, having him say that my answers to the FBI were truthful and then I should quickly add what I said was consistent with what I had said publicly and -- and that's really, sort of in my view, trying to tie both ends together.
<WELKER: Is the one inconsistently though that you said you never sent or received classified material, and he did say there were three e-mails, that were marked classified at the time. Is that an inconsistency?>
<CLINTON:> Well, he -- here's -- here's what -- here are the facts behind that as well, you know that I preside I -- I sent over 30,000 e-mails to the State Department that were work-related e-mails. Director Comey said that only 3 out of 30,000 had anything resembling classified markers, what does that mean? Well usually, if any of you have ever served in the Government, a classified document has a big heading on the top, which makes very clear what the classification is. And in questioning Director Comey made the point that the 3 e- mails out of the 30,000 did not have the appropriate markings and it was therefore reasonable to conclude that anyone, including myself, would have not -- suspected that they were classified. And in fact, I think that has been discussed by others who have said two out of those three were later explained by the State Department not to have been, in any way, confidential at the time that they were delivered. So that leaves the 100 out of 30,000 e-mails that Director Comey testified -- contained classified information but again, he acknowledged there were no markings on those 100 e-mails and so what we have here is pretty much what I have been saying throughout this whole year and -- and that is that I never sent or received anything that was marked ""classified."" Now if in retrospect, which is what is behind the 100 number, if in retrospect some different agencies said but it should have been -- although it wasn't -- it should have been that's what the debate about -- is about. But Director Comey said there was absolutely no intention, on my part, to either ignore or in any way dismiss the importance of those documents because they weren't marked ""classified,"" so that would have hard to do and I will go back to where I started. I regret using one account, I've taken responsibility for that but I'm pleased to be able to clarify and explain what I think the bottom line is on this.
<WELKER: And just very quickly before we get to our panel, Donald Trump says this whole thing means that you can't be trusted with National Security, today you are endorsed by former CIA Director Michael Morell who says it's Trump who can't be trusted, and he went so far as to indicate that that he's been termed (ph) by Putin. Do you agree with that assessment?>
<CLINTON:> Well, I had the great honor of working with Mike Morell, spending a lot of hours with him in the situation room in the White House. He is a consummate professional who has devoted his entire professional career to protecting our country. I was honored to receive his endorsement, I will let his comments speak for themselves but I -- I really appreciated his explaining as he did in his op-ed -- some of what's at stake in this election.
<MONTENEGRO: Thank you Madam Secretary. I believe we have a question from one of our panelists in the previous - could you stand up please?>
<QUESTION: My question is, you've accused Donald Trump of using racist and sexist language. What does it say about the electorate that so many Americans are supporting him?>
<CLINTON:> Well, I -- I really -- I really believe that the core of his support -- I'm not going to speak for everyone who supports him because I think there have been some quite distressing statements coming out of his rallies and his supporters and who has aligned themselves with him -- but I think the core of his support really centers on the disappointment in the economy that so many Americans feel. And what I have been saying is, you know, I'm going to bring this country together. I think we have three overarching goals: we need more economic opportunity, we need to protect our national security, and we have got to work toward American unity. So I have been trying to understand what it is that has driven people to support Trump and I've met with some people, I have listened to them. And so many of them are looking for an explanation as to why they lost the job they had for 18 years when the factory closed and nobody cared about them; what they're going to do when their whole life was spent mining coal and they made $80 thousand a year; now they can barely find a job making minimum wage; why the centers of so many old industrial towns in America are hollowed out and people are turning to opiates and heroin, and the list goes on. And that's what I've heard. So, I think, we have to recognize that of course, some of the appeal is xenophobic and racist and misogynistic and offensive -- we have to acknowledge that. But let's not lose sight of the real pain that many Americans are feeling because the economy has left them behind. So I have said -- I said it again in my acceptance speech last Thursday, I want to be the president for all Americans. I want to lift up and give everybody a chance to pursue their dreams. And that means people who are supporting him. When I went to West Virginia, I knew that I was not gonna win West Virginia, I can tell you that. And I was in a meeting with a group of folks, including a coal miner who was incredibly emotional and talking to me. And outside there was a big Trump protest going on, and one of the people at the protest, for goodness sakes, was Blankenship who had just been convicted of reckless indifference toward the wellbeing of his coal miners -- causing deaths. So clearly the lines are pretty stark. But I have said, you know, I've got a plan for coal country, I've got a plan for Indian country, I've got a plan for inner cities, I've got a plan for rural communities. It's one of the reasons, as I said in my remarks, that I support Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 proposal, which would help all kinds of communities in America. Jim and I have talked about this. So we have to reject and stand up against the appeals to the kind of bigotry and the use of bluster and bullying that we see coming from Trump's campaign, but let's not forget the real economic challenges that too many Americans of all backgrounds are facing today. So that's how I think about it and that's how I'm going to try in this campaign to respond to and rebuke all of the horrible things he says on a pretty regular basis -- but not about me, I could care less about that.
<CLINTON:> But when he goes after individuals; when he accuses a distinguished federal judge of Mexican heritage of not being fair, when he insults a gold star family of a Muslim American who served in the military -- you know the list. I will stand up and call him out on that. But I will also keep reaching out to Americans of all races and ethnicities and where ever they live to tell them that I am not going to forget about them after this election. I'm going work my heart out to help every single person have a better job with a rising income, and make sure their kids get a good education, and everything else that I think they're owed here in America.
<MONTENEGRO: Great, wonderful. And I think we have another question from our panel.>
<QUESTION: Madam Secretary, Ed O'Keefe for the Washington Post. Thank you for being here. And I think on behalf of all of us, we encourage you to do this more often with reporters across the country. (APPLAUSE) Especially those news organizations that travel the country with you everywhere you go. A majority of voters consistently say frankly they don't like you and they don't trust you. And they say pretty much the same thing about Donald Trump. Either you or Mr. Trump will be elected president. How would you lead a nation where a majority of Americans mistrust you? And what extra responsibility might you have to show that you're up to the task?>
<CLINTON:> Well let me start by saying every time I have done a job, people have counted on me and trusted me. And at the convention last week we highlighted the fights of my life, starting as a lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, taking on the problem of juveniles in adult jails in South Carolina, segregated academies so-called in Alabama, fighting for kids with disabilities to get an education, and all the way through the work I did as senator after 9/11, and representing all of you as secretary of state. So there is - I - and I - I take this seriously. Don't, you know, don't doubt that. I take it seriously. You know, it doesn't make me feel good when people say those things. And I recognize that I have work to do. But when I started running for the Senate in New York, a lot of the same things were said. I won. I worked hard for the people of New York. And I was reelected with 67 percent of the vote after I demonstrated that I would be on their side, I would fight for the people I represented. I ran a really hard campaign against Barack Obama, as I think everybody remembers. It got a little contentious from time to time. And to my surprise, he turns around, asks me to be secretary of state because he trusted me. And then I served as secretary of state. And when I left, I had a 66 percent approval rating. So, ask yourselves... <APPLAUSE> ...were 67 percent of the people in New York wrong? Were 66 percent of the American public wrong? Or maybe, just maybe, when I'm actually running for a job, there is a real benefit to those on the other side in trying to stir up as much concern as possible. So, I take it seriously. And I'm going to work my heart out in this campaign and as president to produce results for people, to get the economy to work for everybody, not just those at the top, to do as much as I can to help people who, as I said earlier, may not even vote for me. Because I think our country is at a crossroads election. President Obama said it extremely well both in what his speech discussed in the convention, what his press conferences since have pointed out. This is a crossroads election. There is so much at stake. You can look at my record of public service. You can meet people and families who were benefited by the Children's Health Insurance Program. You can meet people who were benefited by reforming the foster care and adoption system. You can meet first responders and survivors from 9/11 who were benefited because I went to bat for them. You can meet National Guards members and their families who didn't have health care unless they were deployed before I worked with Republicans to fix that. You can go down a long list, and we'd be happy to provide it to you, of what I have done because I believe in public service. And I am proud that I've had the great, great opportunity to work on behalf of giving more people a better life ever since I was right out of law school. So I'm just going to get up every day and make my case. And I think there'll be an opportunity for a lot of people to actually hear it.
<QUESTION: Madam Secretary?>
<CLINTON:> Mmhmm.
<QUESTION: Kevin Merida. I'm editor-in-chief of The Undefeated at ESPN. What is the most meaningful conversation you've had with an African-American friend?>
<CLINTON:> Oh my gosh. Well, could I tell you that I am blessed to have a - a crew of great friends and I've had two chiefs of staff who were my African-American women friends, Maggie Williams and Cheryl Mills. I have been blessed to have people by my side in politics like Minyon Moore who is one of the leaders of my campaign. I've had a great group of young people who I have been really motivated by and, frankly, learned from. So I really have had a lifetime of friendship going back to my college years when one of my best friends was an African-American student, so I can't compress into one conversation -- they've supported me, they've chastised me, they've raised issues with me, they've tried to expand my musical tastes. So we've had -- we've had a lot of -- we've had a lot of great, great times because of our friendships, so I can't really pick one conversation out of, you know, 50 years of conversation and I don't want to embarrass my friends. Peggy Lewis is here, she just became the Dean of Communications at Trinity Washington and I want to congratulate her. Donna Brazile is here, she's our acting chair of the DNC. So I -- I guess I'll leave it at that. I think I'm going to - I'm going to respect the code of friendship silence but please know I've got a lot of great friends who have given me so much more.
<QUESTION: Madam Secretary, there's such little time and there's lots of questions and you're signaling us to -- but I would be remiss. We're in a room full of Latino journalists and I have to ask you and give you an opportunity to respond and set the record clear. Does the Democratic Party, does your campaign, take Latino voters seriously, or are you taking them for granted that they will automatically vote Democrat?>
<CLINTON:> Well, I take them seriously, because I've had the great privilege of working for many years with Latino leaders, activists, business men and women. You know, just as I responded to the question, my first experience working on behalf of Latinos was -- well, actually, even before I was a legal services lawyer, through my church, I babysat Latino kids on Saturdays while their parents and older siblings went to the fields outside of my home in Chicago, which used to be -- hard to believe now, miles of farmland. It was my first real lesson in how much more we all have in common. There I was, 11 or 12 years old, babysitting these little kids and at the end of the day the old ramshackle bus stopped at the end of the road and the parents and the older brothers and sisters got out and these little kids just broke loose and started running down that road with their arms outstretched calling for their mothers and their fathers and getting swept up in very tired arms. And then, when I was a little bit older, my church arranged exchanges with Latino churches. We would go into the city of Chicago, sit in church basements, talk about our lives and, again, it reinforced what, to me, was so much of a common sense of, you know, what we wanted in our lives even though their lives and mine were very different. And as a legal services lawyer - as the chair of the legal services corporation, we expanded legal services into places against a lot of political opposition.
<CLINTON:> So, I feel very fortunate that I've had the chance to work with, and learn from, so many Latinas and Latinos across America. When I ran for the senate, I worked closely with our elected representatives, both at the city, state, and national level. I was honored that they rallied around to support me and were part of the great victory that we had in the primary in New York. So no, I don't take any voter for granted. And I particularly don't take any voter who is placing their trust and confidence in me for granted. Because I am going to get up, as I said, every single day and work my heart out to get the results that I have told you, we're going to achieve together. And I know it's hard. I've been around as you all know, very well. I'm not new to this. It doesn't happen by hoping it happens, or wishing it happens. It happens by doing everything you possibly can and I am blessed to have such close working relationships and friendships with Latino leaders. Tonight, at my house, we will be having a big event with Latino business leaders, coming from around America. And so, I'm going to do what I've always done. You see, I think at the core of political leadership is relationship. You've got to build relationships with individuals and communities. I know that doesn't happen by just asking for it. It happens because you work hard to achieve it. So I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that any Latino voter who votes for me, knows that I'm going to be doing my best to deliver on everything that I've said. And I will tell you as we go along, what the challenges are, because I may need to ask your help. I may need you to put pressure on elected officials. I may need you to flood the internet, or flood the old fashioned mailbox of elected representatives. So they know people are watching. But that's how we're going to get it done. And I'm actually pretty confident and optimistic about that. So I hope that people will take this election seriously, because I sure take you seriously. And together I think we can create the kind of future that everyone of our kids and grandkids deserves. Thank you all very much.
<WELKER: Secretary Clinton, we are out of time. We want to thank you very much. Everyone please, give a big round of applause for Secretary Clinton for coming and answering our questions. We really appreciate it, and (inaudible) your time. Thank you very much.>","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-10"">
<CLINTON:> I am so happy to be back here and to have this chance to talk with all of you and to be introduced by two of the people that I admire most, people who have really made a difference in the lives of so many. I know everybody in Iowa understand that Tom and Ruth Harkin are as good as you can get. There isn't anybody better... <APPLAUSE> And I loved serving with Tom. I had to confess that I miss the idea that he'll be in the Senate. But you got to hear from Patty Judge, and she would be a great senator for Iowa. <APPLAUSE> I want to thank all the elected officials and party officials who are here. I've been in Lincoln High School before and I'm glad to be back. <APPLAUSE> How many of you saw the Democratic Convention? <APPLAUSE> I'll tell you, I had just the greatest sense of joy and pride as Democrats took that stage, and not just elected officials and people running for office, but so many Americans who talked about their lives and what they had gone through and what they had accomplished. It was positive. It was optimistic. It presented a stark contrast to what we had seen the week before at the Republican Convention. <APPLAUSE> And that's why, in this campaign, I'm crossing the country to talk about what we can do to improve the lives of the vast majority of Americans, to create more opportunities for more people, to live up to their own potential and to pursue the American dream. And I can't think of a better place to talk about that than right here in Iowa, because if you build it, they will come. <APPLAUSE> After the convention, my running mate and I, Tim Kaine, got on a bus, we went through Pennsylvania and Ohio, stopping at factories and businesses, talking to groups, listening -- doing a lot of listening -- about what we need to do together. And that's why I've rolled out specific plans about how to create more jobs, to get incomes rising. In the first 100 days of my administration, we will make the biggest investment in new jobs, good paying jobs, since World War II. <APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> Now, how are we going to do that? Well, we're going to invest in infrastructure -- our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. <APPLAUSE> These are good jobs and a lot of them are good union jobs with good pay and good benefits for families. <APPLAUSE> You see, I have this old-fashioned idea that the middle class of America is what makes America's economy work. And what we've been seeing in recent years is a deliberate effort to undermine the middle class. Some of it because of what's called trickle-down economics -- cut taxes for the wealthy, get out of the way of corporations, and that didn't work out so well, did it? <APPLAUSE> Some of it is because the incredible efforts to undermine the right to organize and bargain collectively. The American labor movement helped to create the American middle class. <APPLAUSE> So in addition to infrastructure that you can see, we're going to do water systems. We're going to do sewer systems. We are also going to build a modern electric grid to take the clean renewable energy that is produced in places like Iowa and make sure it can be distributed where it can be used. <APPLAUSE> You know, I -- I am someone who believes that if we do infrastructure and we do clean renewable energy jobs, we're going to be on the way to a 21st century economy that will work for everybody, not just those at the top. And how do I know this? Well, because in the past we've done infrastructure, haven't we? In fact, we are living off the infrastructure built by our parents and our grandparents, and in some cases our great-grandparents. A lot of it is overdue -- overdue for maintenance, overdue for upgrades. So this will be good for the economy as well as for individual workers and businesses. And how do I know about clean renewable energy? Partly because I spent a lot of time in Iowa last year. <APPLAUSE> Anybody who says to me, well, you know, we can't really transition to clean renewable energy, I ask them: Have you been to Iowa lately? <APPLAUSE> You already get a third of your electricity from wind. And there's going to be a lot of people who will be helped by the kind of work we're going to do to make sure that clean renewable energy is available around the country. And people who understand that know we can be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. <APPLAUSE> And some people get a little carried away. Have you noticed that? <APPLAUSE> Well, I get carried away thinking about all the jobs we're going to create. <APPLAUSE> And all the families that are going to have a better chance for the future.
<CLINTON:> I also get carried away by thinking about advanced manufacturing, because what happened in Iowa was not just putting up the turbines. You all figured out that you could actually put them together in Iowa and employ people who are doing that work, and then train people in apprenticeship programs at community colleges to make sure you could maintain those turbines. <APPLAUSE> So the last time I've checked there were about 10,000 Iowans working in clean renewable energy. <APPLAUSE> The other thing we're going to do is help small businesses. I just came from visiting a great T-shirt company, Raygun, right? You've been there. Raygun. <APPLAUSE> Met a young man from Iowa who started that company, employs about 50 people right here in Des Moines, has stores all across Iowa, I see another small businessman that I have gotten to know whose got his own ballet bowl bowling alley, thank you so much. <APPLAUSE> But here's what we've got to do. We've got to make sure that small businesses, particularly those started by young people, get the credit they need and if they've got student debt, I want to put a three moratorium on their student debt payments so they can start their business and see whether they can be successful. <APPLAUSE> My dad was a small businessman and I was really excited to see them making T-shirts on silk screens because that's what my dad did on a bigger scale when he had a little print plant that printed drapery fabrics using silk screens. I used to help him from time to time and I believe in small business, that's why I want to be a small business president. And that's a big contrast with Donald Trump who has spent his career stiffing small businesses, refusing to pay the bills. <APPLAUSE> I don't know what would have happened in my family if after my dad had worked so hard he showed up with the fabrics that he printed for the drapes and they said sorry, we're not paying you. Honestly, that is not how we do business in America and so we're going to stand up for small business and help create more of them to help create more good jobs here in Iowa and across America. <APPLAUSE> We are also going to make the economy fairer. How are we going to do that? We're going to raise the national minimum wage so it's no longer a starvation wage. <APPLAUSE> We are also going to do what Tom Harkin has stood for his entire life, we're going to make sure people with disabilities have jobs and opportunities in this economy. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to make sure that women finally get equal pay for the work we do. <APPLAUSE> So yes, I've been laying out plans ever since I showed up here in Iowa back in April of 2015 and I am thrilled to be the Democratic nominee, to be able to campaign on those plans and take them to Washington. <APPLAUSE> Now, I've got to tell you. If you look at the plans I've laid out and one of independent analysts have done that, here's what they conclude. Under my plans we'll create about 10.4 million new jobs in America.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> Under Donald Trump's so-called plans, we will lose about three and a half million jobs. Now let me translate that into Iowa because if you divide the country by population, here in Iowa you could gain 101,000 jobs under my plans and lose more than 33,000 jobs under Donald Trump's plans. So I've got to tell you what I believe, which is that if we want to get the economy working for everybody, then we need a campaign that lays out the agenda so people can vote for it, so that when I'm elected, I can tell the Congress this is what the people of America voted for us to do. <APPLAUSE> So I get pretty excited and pretty carried away, enthusiastic about what we can do because we've done it before. I couldn't believe all that negative pessimistic talk coming out of the Republican Convention. I didn't know what country they were talking about. Of course, we have challenges. Yes. We have problems, of course we do. But there is nothing America can't do if we decide to set some goals and pursue them because, you know what? We are stronger together. <APPLAUSE> And let me say -- let me say something about what I think is a critical difference between my opponent and myself. Words matter, my friends. <APPLAUSE> And if you are running to be president, or you are president of the United States, words can have tremendous consequences. Yesterday, we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that cross the line. His casual cruelty to a gold star family. His casual suggestion that more countries should have nuclear weapons. And now, his casual inciting of violence. Every single one of these incidents shows us that Donald Trump simply does not have the temperament to be president and commander-in- chief of the United States. <APPLAUSE> So the stakes have never by higher. I am humbled and moved by the Republicans who are willing to stand up and say that Donald Trump doesn't represent their values. <APPLAUSE> Not only as Republicans, but as Americans. I have to tell you, I feel that same sense of responsibility. We may not agree on everything, but this is not a normal election. And I will work hard for the next three months to earn the support of anyone willing to put our country first. <APPLAUSE> As a young man said to me in Florida the other day, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> I also think Trump's belief that he alone can fix America's problems is so contrary to who we are as a nation. Our founders set up our country so that we had three branches of government that had to work together. We had the federal government, state and local governments that had to work together. And that's what we've done so successfully. And along comes Trump and basically says, ""I can do this alone.""
<CLINTON:> Well, what about the troops on the front lines who rely on each other and support each other? What about our law enforcement officers who rely on each other and support each other? <APPLAUSE> What about our teachers and our educators who rely on each other and support each other? <APPLAUSE> What about our doctors and our nurses who rely on each other and support each other? <APPLAUSE> We know that we're stronger together because we've seen what happens when we work together. And that is exactly what we're going to do to build on the progress that we've made; to set those goals and go after them together. But I can't do this without your help. I hope you will join this campaign. Please join us. <APPLAUSE> Join us by texting join -- J-O-I-N 247246, or go to HillaryClinton.com. We are organizing across Iowa. <APPLAUSE> We're going to be helping people vote early so that they can make sure that their vote will count. We're going to be reaching into every part of this state. And we're going to be talking and listening as we did way back in April, to learn what's on the minds of Iowans and to figure out what you need from the next president. Now, I know that any election is hard. It's filled with unpredictable twists and turns. But I want you to imagine what you will feel like the day after that election if we have not come together to chart a course of confidence and optimism that will really get our economy working for everyone, keep us safe and maintain American leadership around the world, and unify our country. That is what I will spend every single day working to achieve. And with your help, Iowa, we will win Iowa. We will win the election. And then we will work together for the future we are seeking. Thank you and God bless you. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-15"">
<CLINTON:> Hello. <APPLAUSE> Wow. Hello, everyone.
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> Thank you. Thank you all so much. It is so great to be back in Scranton, Pennsylvania. <APPLAUSE> I can't tell you how important this is. We both have a lot of memories of Scranton and Lake Winola. That's right. <APPLAUSE> And it is such a nostalgic trip for me because my brothers are here. We came to Lake Winola every summer of my life and loved every minute of it. <APPLAUSE> And there are a lot of people in this crowd who our family has known or Joe's family has known over the years and we are grateful to each and every one of you. It's also wonderful to be here in Scranton with Senator Bob Casey. <APPLAUSE> And your congressman, Matt Cartwright. <APPLAUSE> And your amazing Lackawanna County recorder of deeds, Evie Rafalki McNulty. <APPLAUSE> And we sure miss that husband of yours. We're thinking about you and sending you our best wishes. We're also here with Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, too. <APPLAUSE> And of course, as I said, I'm here with the one, the only Vice President Joe Biden. <APPLAUSE> You know, Joe grew up over on North Washington Avenue. <APPLAUSE> No matter how far he travels, he never forgets where he's from. I have seen him in a lot of settings; in the spotlight as vice president and senator, in quiet moments with constituents and in the Situation Room, helping to make decisions that affect our lives and security. And wherever he goes, he's always the same guy; a fighter for everyone, a champion for towns like Scranton and above all, a fighter for families. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe!>
<CLINTON:> And you know, I think he'd be the first to say that he cares about your families because of his family. Joe senior and Catherine taught Joe that all people deserve to be treated with dignity. When you see someone fall, you help them back up because we are all in this together. That is the Biden Way. <APPLAUSE> We have seen how he fights for working families because he passionately believes in the basic bargain that makes America great, that our economy should work for everyone not just those at the top. <APPLAUSE> He stands up against injustice. He has led the fight to end violence against women and girls. <APPLAUSE> And he stands up for people's lives and health, including the project he's now leader on behalf of President Obama: The Cancer Moonshot to fund breakthroughs and save lives. <APPLAUSE> As many of you know, his wonderful son Beau, a great father, a great public servant, a great human being; passed away last year so this is personal to Joe Biden. He knows it's personal to a lot of families, that's why he's fighting so hard to make a difference. And if I'm elected this fall, I'm going to ask Joe to continue the important work he's begun to help us fight and defeat cancer. <APPLAUSE> So as someone who has worked with Joe for years, first in the Senate then as a member of the Obama-Biden cabinet, I can attest to that passion for standing up for people, trying to make lives better. It's what pushes him to work as hard as he can every second of every day for all of us. And Joe and his wonderful wife Jill have raised their children and grandchildren with those same values. So Joe I hope you know how much not just Scranton but America loves you and your family. So it means a great deal to have him by my side. You know when Joe and I were deciding where to have our first campaign rally, there really was only one answer. Scranton isn't just Joe's hometown; it's my dad's hometown too. While the Biden's were on North Washington Avenue, my family, the Rodham's were a few blocks away on Diamond Avenue. I was christened at the Methodist Church on Court Street. My grandfather went to work at the Scranton Lace Mill starting as a teenager. It wasn't easy work. But you know what I learned? That business treated its workers right. Believe it or not the Scranton Lace Company all those years ago actually offered a profit sharing plan and health benefits at the beginning of the 20th century. They understood something that a lot of folks have forgotten. They understood that their workers were responsible for much of the businesses success, so it was only fair that they shared in that success and that their families benefited too. And because of that job my grandfather could give my father a better life. My father was able to go to college, went to Penn State where he played football. Then after he got out of Penn State it was 1935, right in the depths of the Depression and he was looking for a job. He heard a friend of his knew somebody who heard that somebody was hiring in Chicago so he literally hopped a freight train from Scranton to Chicago -- I don't recommend that anymore -- where he got a job as a salesman. He went into the Navy during World War II and when he got out he started a small business in Chicago where I grew up. And just like his father before him, my dad was determined to give us even greater opportunities than he had. And to me that is the American Dream. No matter where life takes me, I always remember I am the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small business owner and I am so proud of it. And you know the story of the Rodhams and the Bidens isn't unique. What's unique is the country where those stories were written. No matter what Donald Trump says America is great and the American Dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. But that doesn't mean we can take it for granted and just wait until it happens to us. We have a lot of work to do. Here in Scranton you know that. President Obama and Vice President Biden pulled us back from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and put our economy back on a stronger footing. I personally don't think they get enough credit for that. Under their leadership we've created 15 million new private sector jobs, 20 million people now have health care and the auto industry just had its best year ever. So I think the job of the next president is to build on that but to take on the deeper challenges that emerged long before the crisis and have persisted through our recovery. Inequality is too high. Wages are too low. It is still too hard for too many to get ahead.
<CLINTON:> So my top priority is create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top which is why I've set five ambitious goals to get us there. First, we are going to make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. <APPLAUSE> Second, we're going to make college debt-free for all and help millions of people struggling with existing student debt. <APPLAUSE> Third, we're going to crack down on companies that shift jobs and profits overseas. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to reward companies that share profits with their employees like the Scranton Lace Company did almost a century ago. <APPLAUSE> Fourth, fourth...
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Fourth, we're going to make sure that Wall Street Corporation and the super rich finally pay their fair share of taxes. <APPLAUSE> And fifth, we're going to respond to the way American families actually live and work today, by making child-care affordable because in today's economy, there is often no parent or grandparent staying home with the kids. And we're going to fight for paid family leave because sometimes you need to take care of your child or your spouse or sick parent, and you should not lose your job for taking care of the loved ones. <APPLAUSE> Now, you know, whenever I mentioned these issues, you know, Donald Trump always said that I'm playing the woman's card. Well, you know what I say, if that's playing the woman's card then deal me in! <APPLAUSE> I really believe that together this plan will go a long way toward building a stronger, fairer economy where everyone can contribute to its growth. Everyone can share in its rewards. Now, by contrast, what's Trump's plan? Well, he laid it out last week. And I'll admit, even before he did I didn't think it was going to be good for working Americans, but it turned out to be worse than I ever imagined. <LAUGHTER> I know some of you may have friends up here in North Eastern Pennsylvania who are thinking about voting for Trump, you know. <AUDIENCE BOOS> I know, I know. Friends should not let friends vote for Trump. <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> But, just in care you can have a conversation, explain that Donald Trump would give trillions -- that's trillions with a ""T"" -- in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires and Wall Street money managers. That would explode the national debt. <AUDIENCE BOOS> And it would lead to massive cuts in things like education and healthcare. He's even called for a new tax loophole; let's call it the Trump loophole because it would allow Trump to pay less than half the current tax rate on income for many of his companies, a pretty sweet deal. He would end up paying a rate lower than millions of middle-class families. Now, that is assuming he pays any taxes at all because we really don't know because we haven't seen his tax return. <APPLAUSE> But we do know just by looking at the data, we know that the 400 richest taxpayers in America would get an average tax cut of more than $15 million a year from the Trump loophole. And then of course there's the estate tax that Trump wants to eliminate all together. Now, if you believe that he's as wealthy as he claims that would save the Trump family $4 billion. But it would do nothing for 99.8 percent of all the other Americans in our country. So yes, $4 billion tax cut for Trump, 99.8 percent of Americans get nothing. Think of what we could do with those $4 billion. We could pay for more than 47,000 veterans to get a four-year college degree. <APPLAUSE> We could provide a year -- years worth of healthcare to nearly 3 million kids. Or we could fund a years worth of Federal assistance to state and law -- local law enforcement. So there are a lot of better ways to spend the money.
<CLINTON:> And there's one more part of Trump's plan that I want to mention, he's now saying he wants to help people pay for child care by excluding those payments from taxation. Well again, guess who that will help the most, it will help rich people, who will get 30 to 40 cents on the dollar to pay for their nannies. Hardworking families who can't afford childcare in the first place well get little to no real help. That's why his child-care plan has been panned by experts across the political spectrum left, right, and center. Because remember right now, child-care costs as much as in state college tuition in most of the country. So we need real solutions that will work for working people not just the well off and to prove that he really cares about this issue, Trump made a point about talking about how his businesses offer on- site child care to workers. Well, that kind of perked <ph> me up. <LAUGHTER> Because if he really did that it would be a big deal, I wish more companies would provide on-site child-care. That would be a huge benefit for employees, but like so much of what he says is not true. It turns out some of his resorts, hotels, and clubs offer child care- services but for guests not employees. Just saying. If you stay at a Trump hotel you could enroll your kid in something called Trump kids. <LAUGHTER> They will get special childrens room service, childrens spa service even a nanny for a fee but if you work for his business, if you clean the rooms, water the lawns, carry peoples bags, you get nothing. I'm not even sure Trump knows that providing a Trump kids program for paying customers is not the same thing as providing real child care for your workers. Just like his tax breaks for billionaires aren't the same as a real plan to help America's working families. You know, Vice President Biden has a saying I love, ""don't tell me what you value, show me your budget and I'll tell you what you value"". <APPLAUSE> No, it's pretty clear Donald Trump wants to give trillions of tax breaks to people like himself not invest in our veterans, our kids, our police officers, our teachers and anyone who really provides services and we have real serious challenges in America. We need serious leadership, this is not a reality T.V. show, it's as real as it gets. Look at what's happening in Milwaukee right now, we've got urgent work to do to rebuild trust between police and communities ad get back to the fundamental principle -- everyone should have respect for the law and be respected by the law. <APPLAUSE> So on all these important challenges, you have to ask yourself, is Trump up to the job? He's giving a speech -- he's giving a speech about ISIS today, now I've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS over many months. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces taking them out on the ground. Under President Obama and Vice President Biden we are making progress, we will surge our intelligence so we detect and prevent attacks before they happen. We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country. It won't be easy or quick but make no mistake, we will prevail. There is no doubt in my mind. <APPLAUSE>
<CROWD: USA! USA! USA!>
<CLINTON:> And once again, in comparison, Donald's been all over the place on ISIS. He talked about letting Syria become a free-zone for ISIS, a major country in the Middle East that could launch attacks against us and others. He's talked about sending ground troops, American ground troops -- well, that is off the table as far as I am concerned.
<CLINTON:> So we'll wait and see what he says today. But sometimes he says he won't tell anyone what he'll do because he wants to keep his plan quote ""secret."" And then it turns out the secret is he has no plan. <LAUGHTER> And that was very clear when he said, ""I know more about ISIS than the generals."" No Donald, you don't. And on top of that he says more countries should have nuclear weapons, including in the Middle East. He talks about walking away from our European allies. He has the temerity to say that the United States military is a disaster. Well, I wish he'd spent as much time as Joe and I have meeting the brave young men and women who serve in the military. Meeting their families. Meeting with Gold Star families. Those are not the words of someone who respects our military and the sacrifice that our young men and women make every single day. <APPLAUSE> I said in Philadelphia that a man you can bait with a Tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons. It's also not a man you can trust to run our economy, help heal our cities, or be a role model for our children. There is no doubt Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President of the United States and Commander-In-Chief. <APPLAUSE> So my friends, America deserves a president who can get the job done, bring our country together not tear it apart, deliver real results for hardworking Americans. And we can't win this election without you. That's why I'm asking you to join right now. Take out your phone and text ""JOIN-247246."" Or go to HillaryClinton.com. We are hiring organizers right here in Pennsylvania and across the country. We are going to run a vigorous campaign across Pennsylvania. We're going to keep building the future that you and your families deserve, and I am so sure we can do this, especially with this man fighting alongside us just like he always has. So Scranton, please let's give it up for the Vice-President of the United States, Joe Biden. <APPLAUSE>
<BIDEN: Hello folks. It's good to be home. Folks, let me tell you what Scranton does deserve. Well, thank you. Scranton deserves what it's always deserved because it is made up of so many people with grit and courage - I mean this sincerely, from the bottom of my heart - with grit, courage, determination -- who never, ever give up. They deserve someone who not only understands them, they deserve someone who's with them. And they deserve someone who's made of the same stuff. That's Hillary Clinton. That's who she is. (APPLAUSE) It's good to be home. With so many friends as I look around. As a matter of fact one of the people in the reception line said, ""My aunt owns your house."" (LAUGHTER) Tell her I'm coming. I'm coming home. I was there when I was running and up in the bedroom -- written on the wall still is, ""Joe Biden slept here."" And then it said, ""lived here."" I'm glad they added the ""lived here"" part. You know I'm often asked why we moved from Greenridge to Claymont, Delaware and then Wilmington.>
<BIDEN: Claymont's a suburb of Wilmington, Delaware. And it's because of Bob Casey. No, look - the Caseys lived five blocks from us, just around the corner from St. Clair's.(ph) And I am midway between Bobby and Bobby. And I knew only one of us was going to make it out of Greenwich, and I knew it was not going to be me. So I had to move. There was too much Casey talent in the neighborhood. Bobby , you are a great friend and great United State Senator. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) As they say in southern Delaware, they talk at you like this Matt Cartwright (ph), that boy married up. He married right up. I tell you, he was always seeking influence - but you got it, man. You are doing a wonderful job as well. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) I have been home since this time, but I stood here eight years ago kicking off our campaign. Hillary and Bill Clinton at my side. They always had my back. I want to make it clear that as Scranton has always had my back , we and fact, all of us, will have your back, Hillary. (APPLAUSE) Scranton has been so-- some of the folks in our administration were there on election night when the results were coming in. I give you my word as a Biden I asked one and only one question , what did we do in the northeast? We won by a larger margin than we had before. The rest did not matter. I took full credit for it. Nothing to do with it. You know, if you listen to Barack, you'd think I was a kid who just climbed out of a coal mine with a lunchbox from Scranton. I'm the kid from Scranton. Well, I am from Scranton and I was a kid at one time. But so often, quite frankly, my people in Delaware resented -- I've represented them for 36 years a U.S. senator, and 44 years in high public office, and I swear to God -- there's a parade that started on the Fourth of July just as I was getting started in '72 and it was called the Hockessin parade. It's right on the Pennsylvania border. And from the time my boys were then three and four years old, four and five years old -- actually three and four years old -- they were in the parade with me. And so when my Beau -- and he was the most popular politician in Delaware -- I would tag along with him. No, for real, in the parade. So one of the things I am trying to do, Hillary, after the people of Delaware have been so generous to me all these years, and to Beau as Attorney General, I am trying to go back and do as many things in the last year at home in Delaware to show my affection and my appreciation. And so I was in the Fourth of July parade in Hockessin recently, surprising the press and everyone because I was there. And there were thousands of people there. Many of the same people had waited five hours in line to pay respects at my son's viewing, and I was there to thank them for the overwhelming support they gave me for all those years. And as I continued along the parade route, two guys came running up to me, big guys, both guys I played ball with, bigger than me. Secret Service was about to have a heart attack. And they said, Joe, what in the hell is all this stuff about Scranton? You're from Claymont, God darn it. You're from Claymont. You're from Delaware still, aren't you, Joe? So you all have to write a note and tell them I love Scranton, it's my home, but you know what, home is where your character is stamped. Where it's stamped into your soul. Where your values are set. Where your view of the world and your place in that world began. For me, that was 2446 North Washington Avenue around my grandfather Finnegan's table as where I learned that money doesn't determine your net worth. That no one, I mean it sincerely -- this is not hyperbole. This is deadly earnest -- I learned that no one is more worthy than you and everyone is your equal.>
<BIDEN: I learned from my mother, Catherine Eugenia ""Jean"" Finnegan Biden that, and she said this so many times she'd look you in the eye and say, Joey look at me. Remember, you're defined by your courage and you're redeemed by your loyalty. (APPLAUSE) She'd go on to say, because everybody's had tough times, she says as long as you're alive, you have an obligation to strive. You're not dead until you've seen the face of God. What I learned here from my father is that I can be anything I wanted to be. That anything can be accomplished. This is not a joke, this is real. That the measure of your character is not whether you'll get knocked and fall because you will. The measure is how quickly you get up. (APPLAUSE) I learned about resilience from my father, who like many of you and many of your parents made what I call the longest walk. The longest walk any man and woman can make is up a short flight of stairs to their child's bedroom to say honey, I'm sorry, we can't live here anymore. We lost the house. Or Daddy or Mommy doesn't have a job. I remember my Dad making that walk, moving us to my grandfathers' home. I remember - but what I remember most was him saying, but I promise you, everything, everything is -- you can't go back to St. Paul's. You can't play in grooves (ph) and leave anymore. But I promise you, everything is going to be okay and he meant it, he knew it. Because it used to be a basic bargain back then. It used to be a bargain if you worked like hell for the outfit you worked with. When they did well, you got to participate. How's the bargain? What Hillary is all about is making sure that everyone of you, everyone of you can look your child and their grandchild in the eye and say honey, I mean this sincerely, and everything is going to be okay. Think how many people you know who don't feel like they can say that right now. My father when he said it, on the balls of his heels, he meant it because he thought (inaudible) clear shot if you worked hard. Everything I learned from my father and grandfathers table was reinforced by my neighbors and my friends, all around this town. Pride, independence, resiliency. When I moved away from Scranton, I was going into the fourth grade but I never left. I spent summers, holidays, college weekends, weddings, funerals, first communions, bar mitzvahs. By the way - for me, it was Nay Aug Park, it wasn't the lake. (APPLAUSE) I always remember that I've been taught what you all believe up here. Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect, no matter who they are. That America - (APPLAUSE) That America and Hillary gets this better than anybody I know. That America can be defined in one single word, possibilities. That's the thing about America... (APPLAUSE) That's the thing about Scranton, that's the thing about who we are. Anything is possible. That's the America I know. Ladies and gentlemen, that's the America Hillary Clinton knows. (APPLAUSE) You know, the people I trust most? In public life, I've been at this a long time -- trust the people where the feeling starts in their gut, moves to their heart, and then is articulated by a great mind. Hillary understands the hopes and aspirations of the people in Claymont, in Scranton, and every Scranton and Claymont in the United States of America. I've known her for over 30 years. (APPLAUSE) I knew her before she was First Lady, when we served together in the Senate. During her years as Secretary of State once a week, we'd have breakfast at my home. I became the Obama-whisperer.>
<BIDEN: She'd look at me and say, what did he mean by that? (APPLAUSE) He loves her. Everybody knows this has never been an issue with Hillary. Unlike it's a gigantic issue for her opponent. But all kidding aside, everybody, by the way my family's right there, the family. Good morning, I didn't even see you! Secret Service, you see that beautiful young girl there? Make sure she gets back when I leave the stage OK? Because we're not leaving until I get a hug. Anyway sorry guys. It's kind of a family thing. But look, think about it. Everybody has known from day one how smart, how bright Hillary is. Everybody knows how tough she is. But what I don't think everybody knows enough about it may be the different between the Irish Catholic and the Methodist piece here, we wear everything on our sleeve. I don't think they fully understand how passionate she is about what she does. I've known I want you to listen just for a minute. I don't even want you to clap. I want you; because I want to make sure you understand what I know about her. You know she understands that, that college loan to get a bright young girl or boy to school is about a lot more than whether or not they're going to get a chance. It's about the pride and the dignity of the parent who looks at that child. I mean it sincerely, please don't, just listen to this. I remember I went down to my dad's place of work to pick up a car. And he was wandering back and forth in the parking lot. The secretary said, he's out there. I walked out and he said, Joey I'm so sorry, I'm so damned sorry. This was before cell phones, I thought maybe something happened. He said I went to the bank today honey; they won't lend me the money to get you to school. I'm so ashamed. Hillary understands that the most damaging thing to a parent is to look at a talented child or a sick child or a child in need and not be able to do anything. She's understood that for years. She's understood for years that millions of people here in Scranton and Claymont and all across America, went to bed staring at a ceiling thinking, my God what happens if she develops breast cancer? Or he gets lung cancer? What happens? We lose everything. What do we do then? A lot of you remember those days. My family remembers those days. She gets it. She understands what it will mean and I really mean this. It's more than about her. She understands it means for these beautiful young girls, and I'm being serious now, these three beautiful little girls I'm looking at now, what it will mean to them when it's President Hillary Rodham Clinton. It will change their lives. It will change their lives. It will prove that my daughter and my granddaughters can do anything my sons and grandsons can do. That's what it will mean. It's consequential. So let me say this as clearly as I can. If you live in a neighborhood like I grew up in, or my wife Jill grew up in Willow Grove or down in Claymont, if you worry about your job, getting decent pay. If you worry about your children's education, if you're taking care of an elderly parent after losing the other one, then there's only one person in this election who will possibly help you, and that is Hillary Clinton. Folks she's always been there. It's not a joke. You know you use phrases like that. But she has always been there. That's her life story. And let's state the obvious. That is not Donald Trump's life story.>
<BIDEN: Senator Ted Kaufman, who you know very well, Hillary, served with you, used to be my administrative assistant for years and years, graduate of the Wharton School, an engineer my degree (ph) at Duke. He (inaudible) at the Wharton School. The Wharton school by the way, isn't -- doesn't have a Trump sign up. Anyway... (LAUGHTER) That said, the difference between a success and a genuine success -- excuse me -- a minimum success and a real success is someone who had nothing and makes $1 million is a real success. Someone who inherits a million and makes $20 million -- no they're not a bum, but they're a mere (ph) successes. (LAUGHTER) Some are bums, but not all. (LAUGHTER) Look, let me tell you the part that bothers me. And you know, as Hillary will point out and knows that no one ever doubts I mean what I say. (LAUGHTER) The problem is I sometimes (ph) say all that I mean. (LAUGHTER) But let me tell you what really bothers me most, and maybe this only works where I grew up. I don't know. But you know, what bothers me most about Donald Trump is his cynicism is unbounded. I -- I -- no, I really mean this. Think of (ph) this for a minute (inaudible) all raised in this area, you're different ethnicities, different religions, different backgrounds. But there's one thing I've noticed all the years I've sent and I've always, always come home. And that is that the way you were raised, if you ever showed a lack of empathy for someone in trouble, if you ever summed up a thought that the phrase he's most proud of, you're fired -- think -- think about the phrase, you're fired. Think -- no, all kidding aside. I really mean this. Maybe it's just me. But think about what your mother or father or grandmother or grandfather would have said to you. Think about everything you learned as a child. I really mean this. No matter where you were raised. How can there be pleasure in division and you're fired? And he's trying to tell us he cares about the middle class. Give me a break. And to repeat myself, is such a bunch of malarkey. It makes no sense. None, none, none, none. (APPLAUSE) This guy doesn't care about the middle class. And I don't even blame him in a sense because he doesn't understand it. He doesn't have a clue. No, no. He really -- he really doesn't. He doesn't have a clue. And by the way, there's something else he has no clue about that has nothing to do with being a Democrat or a Republican. I have worked -- I have worked with eight presidents of the United States. I have served with hundreds of senators. Only 13 senators in history, I'm embarrassed to say, have served as long as I have. (LAUGHTER) Dozens of secretaries of State and secretaries of Defense of both parties. And I can say without hesitation, my word as a Biden, no major party nominee in the history of the United States of America, has -- now, don't cheer or -- quiet (ph). Just listen. (LAUGHTER) Has known less or been less prepared to deal with our national security than Donald Trump. And what absolutely amazes me -- what absolutely amazes me, that he doesn't seem to want to learn it. No, I really mean it. He doesn't seem to want to learn it. He doesn't seem to think it matters. This man is totally, thoroughly unqualified to be president of the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) He not only lacks the temperament -- people say he lacks the temperament. I -- I'd feel better if that's all he lacked. (LAUGHTER) On every issue that matters most to our security, Donald Trump has no clue what it takes to lead this great country. Now look, you know, if I had said this eight, 10 months ago, they'd say, well, you know, I'm being partisan. Well, I am partisan. I make no apologies for that. But I'm not mean about it, and as Hillary will tell you, I don't know any Democrat that is more positive relationships with Republicans than I do in the United States Senate.>
<BIDEN: But having said that, look at the people who've come out. Scores and scores of the most prominent, Republican thinkers in the national security field. They've come out and both political parties have reported that he has no idea what he's talking about. Even confronted with the facts he doesn't want to learn them. The few times he tries to deal with the facts, he reveals a profound misunderstanding, what's at stake? Just listen for a second, listen to him. He belittles our closest allies in this hemisphere and in Europe. Nations that stand with us are part of our security network that are with us when we address every international challenge. Those who fought and bled alongside us for decades, he wants to toss those relationships aside, like the ones that -- like his failed business ventures, or something. In the meantime, he talks cavalierly, about encourage -- and other nations as Hillary pointed out -- to develop nuclear weapons as if nuclear war is some trivial affair. Does he not understand we wrote Japan's constitution to say they could not be a nuclear power? Where was he when -- in school (ph)? (LAUGHTER) Someone who lacks this judgment cannot be trusted. There's a guy that follows me right back here, has the nuclear codes. So God forbid anything happened, the president and I had to make a decision the codes are with me all -- he is not qualified to know the codes. (APPLAUSE) He can't be trusted. (APPLAUSE) I was proud, my son Beau served for a year in Iraq, came back a highly decorated soldier. I must tell you -- I must tell you that a Donald Trump for president -- I would've thrown my body in front of him. No, I really mean it, to keep it from going if the judgment was based on Trump's decision. Every president since Harry Truman has looked toward a Europe -- whole, free and at peace. One of the most consequential people right now who's trying to undo that is a man that Donald Trump says he admires. Now, I'm not big on the character assassination stuff. I really mean that. I mean look at -- look at everything any campaign I've ever run. I'm just trying to like that old program of where we run just the facts ma'am, nothing but the facts? (LAUGHTER) Oh, that was Joe Friday, actually. (LAUGHTER) But he says he admires Vladimir Putin. (AUDIENCE BOOS) No, no, no, no, no it's more than -- it's more than the boos, here's the deal. What is Putin's objective as -- Hillary knows as well as anyone dealing with Putin as I have and the president, has and John Kerry? Putin is determined to crack NATO and crack the European alliance. That is his overarching, overwhelming interest. I'm heading from here, getting on a plane and flying to Kosovo then to Serbia then I'm going to the Baltic States. You know one of the reasons I'm going? Is to make sure to reassure those who remember the NATO and the Baltic States we mean what we say. We mean what we say, the sacred alliance of 60 years because they're worried. (APPLAUSE) Listen to his comments about Ukraine, are you sure that Russia will not move on Ukraine? But him -- without understanding they've already moved on Ukraine and occupy Crimea. This guy's shame has no limits; he's even got so far as to ask Putin and Russia to conduct cyber attacks against the United States of America. (AUDIENCE BOOS) No, no even if he is joking -- which he's not --even if he's joking, what an outrageous thing to say. Look, folks. These are not isolated examples. He's even showered praise on Saddam Hussein, one of the most violent dictators of the 20th century, a man who repeatedly backed terror attacks against Israel because he was supposedly -- the reason he admires him -- he was a killer of terrorists, that's why he likes Saddam. He would've loved Stalin, he would've loved Stalin. Look, this -- this says a lot about his approach that explains why he so often embraced tactics of terrorists, enemies themselves.>
<BIDEN: Religious intolerance, casting entire communities as culpable for the acts of a few of the community, torture, when he knows it's illegal, and says, he would still order it even though the military commanders said they would not obey his orders. When can you think of ever in history where military commanders have said before a man or woman is elected that they would not follow his orders? Threatening to kill innocent family members of suspects, indiscriminate bombing, what he calls for. That's how anyone hoping to lead this great democracy in the world should behave? Look, he likes autocrats, he wills the politics of fear and intolerance, calling for a ban on Muslims in the United States, slandering proud Muslim parents of a Gold Star family who paid the ultimate sacrifice, threatening to send American citizens to Guantanamo. I tell you, this guy's OK?>
<AUDIENCE: No, no, no.>
<BIDEN: Look, Trump's ideas are not only profoundly wrong, they're very dangerous and they're very un-American. You know, they reveal a profound ignorance of our constitution. It's a recipe for playing into the hands of terrorists and their propaganda. Last year, ISIL's top leader who we had been tracking since we got Bin Laden - Hillary, me, John, everyone else, the president - his name is Al-Baghdadi -- and he revealed the goal of ISIL, he just said it straight out. You can go on their website. He said their goal is to, quote, ""compel the crusaders to actively destroy the gray zones themselves,"" meaning anywhere where Christians and Muslims live, he calls a gray zone. He said the objective is to actively destroy that gray zone. Muslims in the west, he says, will have to quickly find themselves between two choices. Either apostatize or emigrate to the Islamic state and thereby escape prosecution. How does he make the case? By pointing out that no Muslim is welcome in the west. ISIL wants to manufacture a clash of civilizations between us versus them. Trump is trying to give them exactly what they want. Last week he stood in front of a crowd in Florida and said President Obama founded a terrorist organization, ISIL. Now, look. Look. This, I really should end with. You know, that's an outrageous statement, but let me tell you why it's a dangerous statement. Why -- as he might say, the bad guys are listening. Yesterday, the head of Hezbollah, a terrorist organization, Iran's top terrorist surrogate, and a direct threat to our ally Israel, repeated Trump's claim in the entire Muslim world and - I mean, around the world, that President Obama founded ISIL. You say, well what difference does that make? Here's exactly what the leader of Hezbollah said referring to Trump's accusation. He said this, ""this is not just a spokesman for ISIL"" - excuse me, for Hezbollah. ""This is not a simple speech,"" referring to Trump. ""This -"" I'm quoting him. ""This is an American presidential candidate, this was spoken on behalf of the American Republican party, and he,"" meaning Trump, ""has the data and documents to back it up."" If my son were still in Iraq - and I say to all those who are there, the threat to their life has gone up a couple clicks. It's gone up a couple clicks. You saw what's happening in Turkey, where some in Turkey are accusing us of being part of the coup attempt. Ladies and gentlemen, does he have any idea the adverse consequences these outlandish comments have on our allies, our friends, and the physical safety of our troops? Trump is already making our country less safe, and I'm testing your stamina so let me go to the end here. He has said, ""Hillary hasn't forgotten more about American foreign policies than Trump and his entire team will ever understand."" Ladies and gentlemen Hillary has been there, she has been tested. I have been in the room with her as we jointly have with the president's leadership, sent some of these killers to the gates of hell. At our weekly breakfast on the international stage; she is strong, she's respected, she's admired. There is nothing that she does not understand about America's place in the world. Ladies and gentlemen, because she knows one thing, that Donald trump does not know -- it has never been a good bet to bet against the United States of America. Give it a fair shot. Give it a fair chance. Americans have never, never never ever let their country down. Never. Ladies and gentlemen of Scranton, we never allow, we never bend, we never kneel, we never yield, we own the finish line. That's who we are. We are America. (APPLAUSE) And she gets it. We are second to none. And Hillary Clinton is going to write the next chapter in American history. (APPLAUSE)>","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-16"">
<CLINTON:> Hello, Philadelphia. <APPLAUSE> Wow. I -- thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. I -- I am so excited to be back in the city that hosted the greatest convention. <APPLAUSE> I -- I can't tell you, as I've been travelling across the country, how many people have said to me how much they loved being in Philadelphia. <APPLAUSE> And believe it or not, there -- there are some people who hadn't been to Philadelphia before the convention and they left loving this city and I can't thank all of you enough for all the hospitality. I want to thank my long-time friend, Congressman Bob Brady. <APPLAUSE> Thanks to Mayor Jim Kenney. <APPLAUSE> State Senator Vincent Hughes, State Representative Dwight Evans, Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell, city council president, Darrell Clarke, a long time friend of mine, former City Councilwoman Marian Tasco. <APPLAUSE> And all those who spoke in the pre-program and to everybody gathered here. It is exciting to be back, and as you heard, we want you all to register to vote. We have places to register because we don't want you on the sidelines come November. This is the most consequential election. The stakes could not be higher. And we want everybody in Philadelphia, everybody across Pennsylvania, to be part of a great victory in November and then <ph> the future that we're going to build together. <APPLAUSE> Have any of you been watching the Olympics? <APPLAUSE> Well, I've got to tell you, I am a big Olympics fan. I -- those athletes, what they give up, the sacrifice, the work. I understand that Philadelphia's own Nia Ali just made the first round heat in the 100 meter hurdles today. Team USA is showing the world what this country stands for. <APPLAUSE> I am proud of our team there and I'm proud of the incredible teamwork that they show. I was thinking the other day, when Donald Trump speaks, he speaks about fear, he speaks about such negativity and such pessimism. And then I watched the Olympics and it's exactly the opposite. You have young people going out, doing their best every day to get prepared to compete, and that's what we're going to do in America.
<CLINTON:> There is nothing we can't do if we put our minds to it. <APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> I, I was up in Scranton yesterday with Vice President Joe Biden. <APPLAUSE> <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> And we had a great day. Both Joe and I have, in Scranton, so, we saw a lot of people that we're related to, a lot of -- <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> - - how do you do it? They see me on TV and on <ph> tape <ph> and I'm in another state, then I'm in another state, and I'm lucky I can sleep on -- <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> - - and held. But what it's really all about is getting up everyday and being motivated to make sure that every person <inaudible> and every person in this Commonwealth and every person in this country, has the same chance to live up to your dreams. The same opportunities that previous generations of Americans enjoyed. <APPLAUSE> <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> - - educators in the audience who make dreams come true. <APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> Because actually, so I know what we can do together. But how are we going to pay for it? Well I'll tell you how we're going to pay for it. 
<CLINTON:> We're going where the money is. We're going after the super wealthy. We're going after the corporations. We're going after Wall Street, so they pay their fair share. <APPLAUSE> That's why I was so surprised when Donald Trump came out and talked about the economy, because actually he would give trillions of dollars in more tax breaks to the wealthy. He wants a new tax loophole that we call the Trump loophole, that would actually help him and everybody else who is really wealthy to cut their tax rate in half on a lot of their income. He wants to eliminate the estate tax which does nothing for 99.8 percent of all Americans but you know if Trump is as wealthy as he claims to be, it would save his family $4 billion. I got to tell you <inaudible> $4 billion. Early childhood, helping our veterans, helping our law enforcement do what they need to do. Helping more people get the job training and the skills training. In fact, we could hire 95,000 public school teachers for $4 billion. <APPLAUSE> We could actually-- <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> -- health care for our veterans for $4 billion. And we could invest in affordable housing and small businesses for $4 billion. Right here in Pennsylvania. So I think we know what we need to do, the question is whether we will do it and that all comes down to who shows up and votes. That's why we have been registering voters in our campaign. We launched a drive to register 3 million voters and get those voters to commit to vote. It doesn't do you any good if you're registered and you don't show up, right? So we've got people waving over there. They've got their voter registration forms for you. <APPLAUSE> And we want you to be part of this. So here's what I'm asking. I'm asking you to register yourself and I'm asking you to ask everybody you know to register. Because when we do that we make a commitment that we care about what's gonna happen in this election. 
<CLINTON:> And we also care about winning back the Senate, that <ph> making the Senate Democratic again ... <APPLAUSE> ... and trying to pick up some more Democrats in the House of Representatives. That will help too. <APPLAUSE> You see I have this old-fashioned idea, looking at our last two Democratic presidents, President Obama and ... <APPLAUSE> ... and a guy named Clinton. That we got a lot done for America when they were in office, right? <APPLAUSE> You know when I hear folks criticizing President Obama, I'm thinking, ""Well what don't they like? They don't like the fact that he helped save the economy from the worst financial crash since the 1930s? They don't like the fact we now have 20 million more people who have access to affordable health care? They don't like the fact that his intervention saved the auto industry and imposed the toughest new rules on Wall Street? What don't they like? When I hear people criticize Bill I think what don't they like? The peace or the prosperity? It's kind of hard to know.
<CLINTON:> So don't be complacent, my friends, because even though we're doing fine right now, I'm not taking anybody anywhere for granted. We're going to work hard these next 85 days and I can't do it without your help. <APPLAUSE> Now, we have packets for you at the door so you can also canvass. Meet your neighbors. Canvass across west Philly after this event. This evening we're opening our southwest Philly office on 52nd and Cedar. Stop by. The deadline for registering is October the 11. So we have work to do. But here's what I promise you. I promise you that we're going to go not only as hard as we can to win this election, but then to go as hard as we can to achieve the results that the country needs. And that's why I talk specifically about what I want to do. I know that some people make fun of me. They say, oh she has all these plans, and you can go to my website and read my plans. But I'll tell you - you know why I do that? Because I want you to know what I'm going to try to do so you can both help me and hold me accountable for doing what I told you I want to do. <APPLAUSE> We want to create millions of new good jobs and infrastructure because our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports are falling apart. Our water systems. Our sewer systems are falling apart. And we also need a new modern electric grid to be able to take and distribute all the clean, renewable energy that we're going to be producing. And when people say to me we can't bring manufacturing back to the United States, I say but I've seen it. I have seen what we can do. I have been in plants in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, across America who are doing just that. And when I meet the people there's such pride and dignity. When I was in Johnstown Wire Technologies on our bus trip with Tim Kaine and I met people working there, I met a young Marine veteran. He's been there now a couple of years. He is as proud as he can be because he's making something that really makes a difference. And that is exported around the world from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. So don't tell me we can't make things. I know we can. I was in a plant outside of Detroit last week. It used to be an auto-supply plant. Then in 2000 - it was started in 1955 by the grandfather of the guy who's the chair of their board now. In 1955 they started, they were making auto parts, then in 2000 their main customer, one of the auto makers, moved a lot of their production - now they could have been really just broken by that. They could have said, you know what, we gotta close up shop. But that's not what they did. They were so determined to keep that business going. So they said, what skills do we have? What can we do now? And they got into the aerospace business. 
<CLINTON:> There I saw the nosecone of a F-35. There I saw the parts they're making for NASA for the rocket that will take astronauts on the manned mission to Mars. In Warren, Michigan, a place that used to make auto parts, which is now literally making rocket parts. And you know what I thought? I thought, wait a minute, this could have been one of those sort of, poor me stories. You know, we can't do it, we can't compete, but instead people got up and said yes we can and yes they did. Right? <APPLAUSE> And I started looking at the machines that they were using, a lot of precision machines made in Germany, made in Japan, made in Italy. I said to the workers there, could we make those machines? They said, you bet we could. If we have the right partnership between our government and manufacturing, we can have a renaissance in manufacturing. And jobs that will give people good livings, and the pride and dignity of work. And here's something we don't say often enough. More than half of the jobs that are predicted for 2020, are not going to require a four year college degree. So I want to make college affordable for everybody and we're going to get that done. <APPLAUSE> I want to help you refinance and pay down your student debt if you already have that. But I also want to make sure community college is free and we have more technical education back in our high schools. I want us to have more apprenticeships so that more young people get the skills that they can use to fill those jobs in 2020. <APPLAUSE> So I am optimistic and another big area where I'm optimistic is green renewable energy. Where we're going to be the 21st century clean energy super power, not China, not Germany, the United States of America. <APPLAUSE> So, I know we can do this. We got ourselves out of the worst financial crash. We're standing, now we're going to start running again. And we are particularly going to focus on young people who have been left out of education and the job market. And middle aged and older people who have lost jobs and need new skills to be able to compete and win again in the job market. <APPLAUSE> And while we're doing that, we're going to start at the very beginning with early childhood education universal pre-kindergarten. Because we are stronger together and we need all of our people to feel that they've got a shot. You know, even Abraham Lincoln talked about how important it was -- <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> -- give every American a fair shot in the race of life. That's what we've got to get back to. It's just wrong that some people do well and other people feel like they're never going to catch up. So I want to be a President, for not only Democrats but Republicans and Independents too. I want to be a President for the struggling, the striving and the successful. I want to be a President for those who voted for me and those who don't vote for me because we are all in this together.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> So there's a lot we could do on the economy. There's a lot we can do on education. There's a lot we could do on healthcare. We are going to build on the Affordable Care Act and we're going to get the cost of premiums, co-pays and deductibles down and we are going to tackle the high cost of prescription drugs. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to do more to help people deal with mental health and addiction problems. <APPLAUSE> I probably have more people talking to me about mental health and addiction than nearly anything else. You know, folks talk about the economy, they talk about education, but when it gets really personal. You know, I'm in a coffee shop or talking to folks on a line here, and somebody takes my hand and pulls me closer, what they talk to me about is mental health and addiction. <APPLAUSE> And shame on us if we don't do more to help people who are suffering and families who are in pain because of that. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to have a National Security and Foreign Policy that America can be proud of. We are going to lead the world in accordance with our value, in pursuance of our interests and furtherance of our security along with our friends and allies. It just absolutely bewilders me when I hear Donald Trump trying to talk about national security. It's not just as Joe Biden said, it's not just he doesn't know what he's talking about, that's bad enough. But what he often says hurts us. It sends the wrong message to friend and foe alike in the world. <APPLAUSE> And we are living in a complex world. One where we need steadiness, where we've got to have a real sense of how we're going to get where we want to go, to help as many people, to keep our country safe. But to do it with the kind of bigness, the kind of confidence that really marks America at our best. You know, sometimes when I hear Trump talking about how we should all be so afraid all the time. And then I find a few minutes to watch the Olympics, I think my goodness, you know, when you go out and compete, not everybody can win but you got to do your best. <APPLAUSE> And can you imagine, you know, Michael Phelps or Simone Biles or all these other great American athletes, in the locker rooms, well I don't know I'm too afraid to go out and compete. No, they get out there. They compete. They do their best. They demonstrate the kind of spirit that we want from all Americans. <APPLAUSE> And then finally, I think we have to defend the advances and rights that we have made here in America. And - - <APPLAUSE> I am very proud of our young people. This is the most tolerant and generous generation that we've ever seen in America. And yes, we are going to defend human rights, and civil rights and women's rights and gay rights and voter rights, and worker rights. <APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> Because if we're going to lift everybody up, we need to do it in a way that lets those people feel that their dignity is respected as well. And yes, I am going to take on the gun lobby to try to save lives here in Philadelphia and across Pennsylvania. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> And as I -- as I said here in Philadelphia in my speech, that doesn't mean I want to abolish the Second Amendment. That doesn't mean that I wanna round up people's guns. What that means is I wanna keep you from being shot by somebody who shouldn't have a gun in the first place. <APPLAUSE> We can't let this go on, we need comprehensive background checks. Close the gun show loophole, the online loophole. We need to pass a law finally that says people who are on the terrorist watch list can't buy -- can't buy weapons in America. <APPLAUSE> So I'm excited about what we can do but first, we gotta get there. So let me thank you for being out here on a hot, August afternoon at this beautiful high school. <APPLAUSE> And let me ask you to be sure to register to canvass to be part of this campaign because I'm not trying to just win an election. I'm trying to build a base of voters who understand that we've gotta stand up for these rights. We have to work for these causes, we have to be committed to these goals, who will get up with me after the election and work to make sure that we actually deliver the results that we all know we need. So my friends, lets go to work and let's build the future that America deserves. Thank you and God bless you! ","The Grammar Lab"

<CLINTON:> Hello. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you so much. Wow. Oh, I -- I am so happy to be here. It is great being in Cleveland. Thank you all. <APPLAUSE> I want to thank Kim Bratak <ph>, a teacher right here at John Marshall, for introducing me. <APPLAUSE> And I want to thank all the teachers and educators, the staff and the students of John Marshall. <APPLAUSE> I am delighted to be here with your mayor, Mayor Frank Jackson. <APPLAUSE> Also, with my long-time friend, your former governor, candidate for the Senate, Ted Strickland. <APPLAUSE> With your county executive, County Executive Budish, I know is here somewhere. <APPLAUSE> And with my great friend, who did an excellent job presiding over the Democratic National Convention, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge. <APPLAUSE> I always love being here, and today is particularly special because I got a tour of this high school. <APPLAUSE> And I first of all want to thank the people of Cleveland for investing in a high school that is really all about the future. <APPLAUSE> What a stark contrast this high school poses to what happened here in Cleveland during the Republican convention. Because honestly, they painted such a bleak, negative picture of America. I couldn't recognize our country, listening to their angry speeches, the kind of negative view that they had of our people. Donald Trump saying, ""We never win anymore."" Well, tell that to the Cavaliers. <APPLAUSE> Tell that to our Olympic athletes who are cleaning up in Rio. <APPLAUSE> There is nothing we can't do if we put our minds to it. And that's how I want America to feel about itself and how I want every American to feel. And I saw the future -- the students and teachers who showed me what they're doing here in robotics in 3D design, in laser design, in entrepreneurial and civic education. I, for one, am really proud of this high school and what it represents for the students here. <APPLAUSE> And why is that so important for those of us who are no longer in high school? Because we've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. And how are we going to do that? Well, I know that too many families right here in Ohio are feeling a lot of financial stress, worrying about they're going to make ends meet, dealing with all the costs from childcare to prescription drugs. I understand that.
<CLINTON:> That's why I have laid out specific plans about how we're going to get the economy working for everyone. And I think it's important when someone comes to you and asks for your support running for president, that maybe they tell you what they want to do, so that you can decide who you want to vote for. <APPLAUSE> And sometimes you know, I get criticized for doing that. People say, ""Oh, there she goes; she has another plan."" <LAUGHTER> Well, I do. I've got an infrastructure plan to create millions of jobs fixing our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems, our sewer systems. <APPLAUSE> As part of that plan, I want to start a national infrastructure bank, so that we have public and private funds working together, so we don't just wait on Congress to act, but we are building, rebuilding, maintaining all the time. And it's not just what we can see, as important as that is. We need a new, modern electric grid that can take and distribute clean, renewable energy across America. <APPLAUSE> And we need to finally finish the job of connecting every home and business everywhere in America, from inner cities to remote rural areas, to high-speed broadband access, so they can be a part of the 21st century digital economy. <APPLAUSE> You know, I was talking to a group of my friends who are teachers. I love teachers. Thank you all for being here with me. <APPLAUSE> And they were telling me that there had just been a national survey done. And the teachers were asked, ""Do you ever"" -- you know, ""Do you ever assign homework that requires your students to go on the Internet?"" and the answer was 70 percent, yes, they did. Now, that makes perfect sense if you just saw what I saw. You gotta have knowledge of the Internet. You've got to be able to learn to use it. It can spark your imagination, create new dreams. I met young people. I said, ""Well, what got you interested in computer design, 3-D design, robots? Well, they were interested in the arts. They were interested in what they could do to design and make things. So, the answer was 70 percent of teachers, but here's the problem: 5 million students -- 5 million homes with students in them in America do not have access to the internet. And so, we're already creating a big gap -- a homework gap, which turns into an achievement gap, and doesn't give every kid the chance to go as far as his or her hard work and talent will take them. So, when I talk about infrastructure, I'm talking about making our economy more competitive and creating more opportunities for more Americans willing to work for it. Because I believe in the basic bargain if you're willing to work, you ought to be able to get ahead and stay ahead. That's how I was raised and that's what I want Americans to believe again. <APPLAUSE> You know, this past Monday I was in Scranton, Pennsylvania, with Joe Biden. <APPLAUSE> And Joe was born in Scranton. My grandparents, my father was born in Scranton. I went back to Scranton every summer, lot of Christmas holidays. My grandfather was an immigrant; came as a young child. He worked in the Scranton lace factory making lace, which was a big deal back in those days. I remember, we used to have lace curtains and lace tablecloths and things like that.<LAUGHTER>
<CLINTON:> And my grandfather worked really hard, because he believed that if he worked hard, he could provide a better life for his kids. And he did. My dad got to go to college. He went to Penn State, where he played football and... <APPLAUSE> And he took a job in the Midwest as a salesman and then went into the Navy during World War II. When he came out, he started a small business and he worked really hard. And I used to go help him sometimes because he printed fabric for draperies. And he had a print plant, and he had two long tables, and it was, you know, not a -- it was just an old plant -- it was low ceiling, no windows. And he would print that drapery fabric. He'd take an old- fashioned silk screen, and he'd put it down, and he'd pour the paint in, then take a squeegee and then go from one side to another, pick up the screen, keep going down the table. And he provided a good life. I grew up in a suburb of Chicago and so I know what the American dream is all about. I am proud to be the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small businessman, and standing here before you. <APPLAUSE> And so when I think about how hard my dad worked, and I think about him printing those fabrics, and then loading them into his car, and delivering them to whoever ordered them, and then expecting to be paid because he had done the work, it just really hits me personally when people are standing up and telling their stories. They were small-business people, they were plumbers, electricians, painters who did work for Donald Trump and he refused to pay them. That violates the basic bargain. If you do your job, you're supposed to be rewarded for your work, not stiffed, not told to go sue somebody. <APPLAUSE> And I can't help but take it personally, because I think about what would have happened to my family if my father had taken a job like that and put his heart and soul into it, bought the material, bought the paint, did the labor, shows up, delivers the product and is told, ""We're not paying you."" But person after person, small business after small business, is telling the same story, that they were not paid. They were told to go sue Donald Trump. Now, you're a small business; you can't afford lawyers to go sue somebody. That's not the way it's supposed to work. So, when I talk about creating new jobs in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean renewable energy, I also talk about creating more small businesses. And small businesses that will actually grow and give more people a chance to fulfill their dreams and will be part of the basic bargain who will be paid for the work that they do so they can stay in business. <APPLAUSE> Now, I got to tell you, creating the jobs of the future means we've got to make sure that all Americans, not just young Americans, have all the education and all the skills that are needed. That's why I want to start with early childhood education so that more young kids get prepared to succeed in school. <APPLAUSE> I want to see more technical education like I saw right here in John Marshall across America, so that high school students can be better prepared. You know, when we stopped doing vocational education some years ago, we basically sent a message to so many young people: There's only one way to be successful in America; you've got to go to a four- year college.
<CLINTON:> That is so unfair and it's also untrue. <APPLAUSE> Actually, if you look at job projections, more than half of the jobs that will be available in America in 2020 will not require a four-year college degree. And so, how are we going to get our people prepared? We're going to bring more technical education, not the old fashioned kind, but what I saw here at John Marshall. We're going to bring computer coding, like I saw in a classroom just a few minutes ago. We're going to bring engineering and design work. We're going to give young kids in high school the chance to either, get that education right in their own school, or go to a community college that will provide it and give them credit to get them credentials, an associate degree, or credit to go on to a four- year college. So we're going to be more on apprenticeship programs. <APPLAUSE> I want everybody who's willing to work to be prepared. I don't want any excuses. I'm a kind of no excuse person. If you are willing to do the work, I want to make sure we've got an economy that will produce the jobs. And then I want to make four-year college affordable. If you go to a four-year public college or university, it should be affordable. And we're going to make community college free for everybody that wants to go to community college. And we're going help everybody with student debt pay down the debt. Get it off their backs. Now, I think -- I think it's fair to say, OK, how are you going to do all that? That's fair to ask. Well, we're going to do it in two ways. Number one, we are going to tax the wealthy who have made all of the income gains in the last 15 years. <APPLAUSE> The super wealthy, corporations, Wall Street, they're going to have to invest in education, in skills training, in infrastructure because, we have to grow this economy. We do need to have the resources to do that. And I've laid out what I want to do and how I would do it; closing the loopholes, creating a fairer tax system. But I've made very clear, I'm the only candidate who ran in either of the Democratic or the Republican primary who said from the very beginning, I will not raise taxes on the middle class. The middle class has to catch up to they were before the great recession. <APPLAUSE> And so, I've laid this all out. And so independent analysts, economists and others are looking at what I've said and what Donald Trump has said. And in fact, according to an independent analysis, by Moody's Analytics, carried out by the man who was John McCain's economic adviser -- if you were to implement what I am proposing, we would create at least 10 million new jobs in the first term of my administration. <APPLAUSE> By contrast, if you look at what Trump is proposing and how he wants to give huge tax breaks to people who are wealthy like him, it would cost our economy 3.4 million jobs. Now, this is not me saying it. This is an independent analysis saying it that has tried to look at this very objectively. But what does that mean for Ohio?
<CLINTON:> If we divide across the country by population, Ohio would gain 376,000 jobs under my plans and lose more than 123,000 jobs under Donald Trump's plans. <APPLAUSE> And it's hard -- it's not hard to see why: Because he wants to give tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, Wall Street money managers. He's even created a new tax loophole that we call the Trump Loophole, because it's really good for Trump. <LAUGHTER> It would let millionaires and billionaires cut their tax rate in half on a lot of their income. Under his plans, Donald Trump would pay a lower tax rate than middle-class families. Of course, we have no idea what tax rate he pays, because, unlike everybody else who's run for president in the last four or five decades, he refuses to release his tax returns, so the American people can't really judge. <APPLAUSE> And then there's the estate tax which he wants to eliminate altogether. So if you believe Donald Trump is as wealthy as he claims -- we can't say that for sure but let's assume it -- he would -- by eliminating the estate tax -- save the Trump family $4 billion and do absolutely nothing for 99.8 percent of all Americans. Now, think about what we could do with $4 billion in Ohio. We could build 280 new elementary schools. We could eliminate the outstanding student loan of 166,000 Ohioans. <APPLAUSE> We could provide health care to 370,000 veterans. <APPLAUSE> And we could sure rebuild every crumbling bridge in this state, and fix a lot of the highways that are causing folks to incur expenses. <APPLAUSE> Donald Trump doesn't need a tax cut. I don't need a tax cut. It's time for the wealthiest Americans, whoever you are, as well as corporations and Wall Street to pay your fair share in taxes. You have been successful in this country because of everything this country represents. We're going to stop giving tax breaks to corporations that out- source jobs and profits. We're going to reward those who invest in their employees again. If corporations move their headquarters overseas, we're going to slap an exit tax on them and try to persuade them not to move. <APPLAUSE> We're going to add a new tax on multi-millionaires, crack down on tax gaming and close loopholes, and then use that money to make the kind of investments that will grow the economy for everybody. So here -- here's the bottom line. There are just 83 days left in this election. I keep track of them, cross them off. <LAUGHTER> And for anyone waiting for Donald Trump to suddenly become more responsible... <LAUGHTER> ... remember what a great American, Maya Angelou, said: ""When someone shows you who they are, believe them.""<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> And I -- I think it's fair to say that Donald Trump has shown us who he is, he can hire and fire anybody he wants from his campaign. They can make him read new words from a teleprompter. <LAUGHTER> But he is still the same man who insults Gold Star families, demeans women, mocks people with disabilities, and thinks he knows more about ISIS than our generals. <APPLAUSE> There is no new Donald Trump. This is it. And you know, I hope you will talk to any of your friends who are flirting with the idea of voting for Donald Trump. Friends don't let friends vote for Trump. <APPLAUSE> So now -- now here's what I have to ask all of you. I'm proud that we have run a campaign of issues, not insults. That's what I'm going to continue to do for the next 83 days. Because I think the details actually matter. That's why I sweat the details. You know, I -- I really care a lot about what happens to the young people and the families and our seniors. That's why I'm going to do everything I can to raise the national minimum wage so that it is a living wage. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that you have the health care you need at an affordable price. <APPLAUSE> And get the costs of prescription drugs down because they are once again getting out of reach. I was at an event the other day, and a very distinguished doctor, the head of a big hospital in New York, he said, ""We've got to do something about prescription drug costs."" This is not a -- not a patient or a family. This is one of the most distinguished doctors in New York City. He said, ""It's getting to the point where I can't prescribe certain drugs that my patients need because the insurance won't pay for them; Medicare, Medicaid -- nobody will pay for them because they are too expensive."" And he mentioned particularly a drug by Gilead that will cure hepatitis C. And it is so expensive that a lot of Americans are being left out. And you know what really is upsetting about this? Is that drug company sells that same drug all over the world at a much lower price to everybody else. Now, I'm proud -- I'm proud that our drug companies invent drugs to cure really terrible diseases and treat chronic diseases. I'm proud of that. But let's be clear. Your tax dollars help support the research that is used to create those drugs in the first place. <APPLAUSE> Your tax dollars support the Food and Drug Administration that tests those drugs to determine whether or not they are safe and effective to be able to go to market. And then we end up in America paying the highest price for those drugs that we have helped to create. We have got to take this on. And we can do it without hurting research and discovery and new drugs and new devices.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> And there are two other issues that I want to mention respecting health, because I've been on the campaign trail now for -- well, about a year and a half ever since April of 2015. So I have talked with and mostly listened to thousands of Americans. Now, people talk to me about their jobs, they talk to me about education, they talk to me about student loans and the high costs of college. They talk to me a lot about gun violence. They talk to me a lot about the things that are on their minds. But the most emotional encounters I have are when families grab my hand and talk to me about mental health and addition. <APPLAUSE> We have got to do a better job. We have too many families and too many individual Americans whose lives are being either totally undermined or shortened because of mental health and because of addiction. So I'm going to work on those things too as your president because we've got to tackle these two problems. <APPLAUSE> And I also want to defend the rights that Americans now have from all of the various attacks that people are waging. That's why I -- I support human rights and civil rights. I support women's rights. <APPLAUSE> And yes, I will defend Planned Parenthood against all of these partisan attacks. <APPLAUSE> I support gay rights. <APPLAUSE> Voting rights which are under attack across America including right here in Ohio. <APPLAUSE> I support worker's rights, the right to form and organize a union and bargain collectively. <APPLAUSE> I support the rights of people with disabilities who deserve more chances to be integrated into the economy and society. <APPLAUSE> And yes, I will take on the gun lobby and try to get common sense gun safety measures passed. <APPLAUSE> And know -- I know -- I know how difficult this is but here is what I want to say. I want to say what I said at the convention in my speech, I am not at all advocating the repeal of the Second Amendment. I am not at all advocating any program that would in any way take people's guns away. Here is what I'm advocating. I want to help you stay alive so that nobody who shouldn't have a gun in the first place gets one and hurts you or other people. <APPLAUSE> Because when I think about the three big challenges the next president faces; getting the economy to work for everybody not just those at the top, keeping us safe and leading the world with steadiness, and unifying America. It's not just the job for the president, we all have to do our part. <APPLAUSE> And when it comes to keeping Americans safe, I want to keep you safe in your own communities and your homes from gun violence. I want to keep us safe from terrorists no matter where they are from or what they are after.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> I want to make sure that we keep our alliances strong because I know how important it is that we work together to defeat the terrorist threat. And I will bring all the experience I had as a senator, serving on the Armed Services Committee, as a secretary of state to make sure that America remains the most free, the most safe, the most important leader in the world. <APPLAUSE> But I also want to unify our country. You know, I bet if we had the time, we'd find something that every single one of us disagreed about with everybody else. We have different experiences, different backgrounds. I think that's part of the American DNA. You know, our founders had some big arguments. We have a lot of impassioned people who care about the future of our country and what we should do. <APPLAUSE> But at the end of the argument, we've got to come together. We are the greatest example of freedom, and opportunity, and justice that the world has ever known, and we can't do anything that ever undermines that. And that's why it is so important that we seek and find common ground together. I did that as a first lady, I worked with Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, that now covers 8 million kids. <APPLAUSE> I worked with Republicans to reform the adoption and foster care system, which I care deeply about. <APPLAUSE> I worked with Republicans after 9/11 to rebuild New York and to make our country safer, to get health care to National Guard men and women. I worked with every Republican I served with just about. I worked with Republicans as secretary of state. We got a new treaty with Russia to lower the number of nuclear weapons and that took 67 votes and we had to get Republicans, as well as Democrats to agree with that. <APPLAUSE> I happen to believe I don't have all the answers. I happen to believe we are stronger together in charting a course toward the future. <APPLAUSE> So, I need your help, stronger together is not just a slogan for our campaign, it is what I believe in my heart. I will get up everyday in the White House, trying to figure out how we're going to create more jobs, more opportunity, keep us safe, unify us, and that's where you come in. I hope you will join this campaign. You can do so today, by texting join, join at 42746 or you can go to Hillary Clinton.com. We're hiring organizers in Ohio. So if your interested in working as an organizer, see one of our people who will be at the doors as you leave. If this a consequential election, I understand a lot of the concerns that many Americans have, wondering and worrying about our country. About their lives, about their kids lives, about their retirement, about the purpose and dignity of their work. So I know we've got challenges that we have to address. But I am absolutely sure we can do this, I believe America's best days are still ahead of us. <APPLAUSE> If you will join this campaign. Join our cause. Together we will, not just win an election but chart a course of confidence and optimism, getting results for the American people. Come join me, please. Thank you all very much. <APPLAUSE>","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-09-05"">
<KAINE: Hey, guys. How are you doing? Happy Labor Day! (APPLAUSE) Wow, ain't no mountain high enough. Are we going to climb that mountain on November 8 and make history? (APPLAUSE) Absolutely. Man, Cleveland does rock. (APPLAUSE) Wow, Cleveland does rock. It is so good to be here and it's especially good to be here on Labor Day when we acknowledge all the hard work. All the history that's been made by unions, labor, and working people in this country. Give it up... (APPLAUSE) ... give it up for unions, give it up for labor. I want to do a few thank you's because it takes a lot of great people to put an event like this together. First, your Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, what -- isn't she the best? She did such a good job for us at the Convention, such a good job, so great to have her here. Boy, as we were doing some thank you's and photos, everybody who came through the line, she gave us who they were and everything about them in 7.5 seconds. I have never seen a presentation so good, your congresswoman. In the U.S. Senate, I have no better friend than Sherrod Brown. Sherrod and Connie are sitting right there. (APPLAUSE) You are so lucky to have Sherrod. And you're going to be lucky on the evening of November 8 when they call this election and you had another great Democrat, Ted Strickland, to the United States Senate. (APPLAUSE) My friend, Ted, we were governors together and had -- we -- we spent a lot of good time together when we were governors together, and it's great to be here with you, Ted. Congresswoman Beatty, thank you so much. Give it up for Joyce Beatty and her husband. (APPLAUSE) And then your mayor, Mayor Jackson, so good to be with you. Thank you so much. Give him a round of applause. (APPLAUSE) And then what a treat to be standing here on stage with these great labor leaders, President Trumka, AFL-CIO. What a great friend, Rich. (APPLAUSE) I got to know him when he was head of the United Mine Workers. We got a big mineworkers presence in Virginia. He's a guy who's always told it straight, always had my back. And I can't tell you how much I appreciate your leadership to this day. Thank you. Randi Weingarten with AFT. Give her a round of applause. (APPLAUSE) And raise your hand if you are an educator so we can give you all a round of applause. To our educators. (APPLAUSE) And then, your hometown guy, AFSCME International President Lee Saunders. Give it up for Lee. (APPLAUSE) Now I know that there are other electeds here, too, in particular. I think Tim Ryan might be here. Give Tim Ryan a round of applause. (APPLAUSE) I think he was here earlier. Look, this is a -- this is a big day because I think, you know, Labor Day sort of starts the home stretch of the campaign. So do we feel like battle-tested and ready for the home stretch so that we can make history and elect Hillary Clinton on the eighth of November? (APPLAUSE) And Ohio is going to be there, right? (APPLAUSE) You guys have a habit of being there because you know how to do it, you know how to do it, you know how to make the grassroots work so that we can move progress in this nation forward, and that's what we're going to do on November 8 with Hillary. (APPLAUSE) Can I just tell you -- I'm going to talk for a few minutes and then I'm going to bring her out. I know we're really here for her. But I want to tell you how proud I am to be on this ticket. And I want to tell you something about Hillary. When she called and asked if I'd be on the ticket, she said something really important that tells you the way she thinks about the job she's going to have to do. She asked me and I started to say yes and she said, no, be quiet. I haven't told you why yet."" She said, look, the test of a Clinton administration will not be a bill signing. It will not be the margin by which something passes in the House or the Senate. That's not going to be the test. The test is going to be, do we do something that makes a classroom better for a teacher that wants to teach and a child that wants to learn? That will be the test. (APPLAUSE) Can we do something that will make it safer in a neighborhood or that will make it easier for parents around the table as they're talking about how to afford college for their kids? Can we do something that will make a workplace safer or a business more able to hire people or a worker find that they can get skills more easy or a job more easy? You know, the test is going to be -- in a Clinton Administration -- can we make a tangible, concrete, significant difference in the lives of everyday Americans? That's going to be the test. Folks, that tells you something about who Hillary Clinton is. (APPLAUSE) She is focused upon everyday folks. She's running against a guy who's been sitting up on the penthouse, and he doesn't even understand the lives of everyday folks, and he's not focused on making the lives of everyday folks any better. And so she said, look, you've been a mayor. You've been a governor. You've been a senator. I think you can help me figure out how to make sure that what we do impacts people in their daily lives. So, needless to say, I'm proud to be on the ticket with the woman who is the most qualified person to be president... (APPLAUSE) ... that either party has nominated for a long time and probably ever. And can I tell you something that really made me mad today? Donald Trump put out a tweet today about our nominee for president and the tweet essentially said, she doesn't look presidential, does she, fellas? (BOOING) Wait, listen to that again. Listen to that again. This is what he said, She doesn't not look presidential, does she, fellas? Does she, fellas? Here is my prediction. At the end of the second term of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump will still be saying that very same thing as he's hawking bottled water somewhere and we forgotten that he ever ran for president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) It is important that we're here on Labor Day. I grew up in a -- in a labor house, just a quick story. My dad ran an iron worker-organized welding and metal shop in the stockyards of Kansas City, Missouri. And my dad's shop -- some of these guys have heard me tell the story -- five employees in a bad year, 12 employees in a good year, plus my two brothers, and me, and my mom. And here is what my dad taught me. He taught me that his business judgment would put his workers' kids through school, but he always taught my brothers and me, and the artistry of my union iron workers will put you boys through school. It's about teamwork. It's about working together. It's about shared prosperity. That's what this country is built on and that's what our ticket and our party stand for. (APPLAUSE) Shared prosperity, the value of hard work, and the fact that we can do more and that we are stronger together. Now since the -- since the Convention, when I got added to the ticket, the first thing we did is go right out on trail on a bus tour through Pennsylvania and Ohio to talk about building an economy that works for everybody. That is going to be the number one test of the Clinton administration -- working together. Can we not put it in a brochure or put it in an ad, but can we implement it and do it so that people all over this country see that they have a ladder to climb? Right, that they have a ladder to climb to prosperity. Thank goodness. President Obama has brought us out of the worst recession since the 1930s. (APPLAUSE) Thank goodness for him. And you all know he had to do that without one party in Congress lifting one finger to help him. It was very difficult to create 15 million new jobs to cut the unemployment rate in half, to make pensions and retirement accounts were something again, and we owe it to President Obama to thank him for what he has done. (APPLAUSE) However, we also know in Ohio and Virginia, everywhere, there is more to do because there are too many people, and they might be in inner-cities. They might be in rural America. They might be in coal country. They might be in Indian country. Too many people who don't look out and see that they have a ladder that they can climb to success. And what we got to do, what Hillary and I are bound and determined and promised to do is work together with Congress to try to put some important new policies in place so that people see that ladder and we build an economy that works for all. And that's why we have been going around the country since the Convention, talking about what we're going to do. We're going to invest in manufacturing and infrastructure, and labor will be key... (APPLAUSE) ... to making those investments, hiring people making it work. We're going to invest in education and skills from early childhood education to giving our teachers the tools and flexibility they need to succeed in the classroom without a lot of top-down strings all over them from Washington. We're going to make college affordable, debt-free for Americans and free community college for people who can't afford it. (APPLAUSE) And we're going to reinvigorate career and technical training because you don't just need a college degree to succeed, union apprenticeship programs, career and technical education are a path to success in the 21st century. We're going to focus on that. (APPLAUSE) We're going to focus on equity. Raising the minimum wage for God sakes so that you don't work full-time in this country and be below the poverty level. Equal pay for women, I mean, what a -- what a novel concept that would be. Child care tax credits so that a working parent can have a good job without spending too much of their money on high-quality child care. We're going to do that. So it's about investments, it's about education, it's about equity, and it's also about knowing that small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Two-thirds of jobs in this country created by small businesses, Hillary knows that from her family background, and I do, too. That's what we're going to do. Hillary Clinton, folks, will be a you're hire"" president. Who here wants a you're hired president? (APPLAUSE) Obviously, obviously. Well, you know what kind of president Donald Trump is going to be? (BOOING) A you're fired president. I mean, there's sort of a poetic justice to the fact that when we think about Donald Trump before he was running for president, we knew him as a guy who was known for the two words, you're fired. When they tell you who they are, pay attention to it. That's who he is. That's kind of -- that's the kind of president he'll be. And you see it with everything he's done when he was building casinos, and golf course headquarters, and small businesses like my dad's would get the contract to do the work, and they would do the work, and they would pay their employees, and they would pay their material costs, and they would say, I'm done. What do you think? And they would be told, yes, the work is great. Well, pay me, and then Trump would stiff them. Hundreds of businesses he wouldn't pay. Some had to go into bankruptcy because he knew he was a big guy, and he thought he could just push aside the little guys. And they got hurt -- they got hurt because they trusted Donald Trump. The students who gave him thousands of dollars to go to his bogus university got hurt because they trusted Donald Trump. Retirees who gave them money for condos in Florida and never got the condos got hurt because they trusted Donald Trump. And now Donald Trump wants us to trust him? Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? (BOOING) He's doing a job interview. That's what this is. You know, when I'm doing a job interview, you are interviewing us. You're interviewing Hillary and Donald to be president. And he is coming out and he says, I want this job. And you say, well, let's see. Every president since Nixon, folks, has produced their tax returns. Why don't you produce your tax returns? No, I'm not going to do it. Well, how about giving information about your health, you know, medical records, no, I'm not going to do it. How about information about with you own money to Wall Street banks or the Bank of China, no, I'm not going to do it. If somebody came to your office and they wanted a summer job and you asked them questions that were important and they didn't answer, would you give them the job?>
<AUDIENCE: No.>
<KAINE: Then you cannot give the job of commander-in-chief, president of the United States to a guy who won't answer the basic questions of the American public. We just can't do it. (APPLAUSE) He must think we're gullible. He must think we're chumps. He must think we're marks, but we're not. Ohioans are not gullible. Virginians are not gullible. Americans are not gullible. And that's why we're not going to elect Donald Trump. And that's why we're going to support the ,you're hired president, Hillary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) Last thing I want to say, this is an important thing to me. I made my career before I got into politics as a civil rights lawyer. I was doing fair housing litigation all over Virginia and in other states in the South. When somebody was turned away from housing because of their race or because of their disability, I would take the case and represent them in court. Often, they couldn't find anybody else to represent them... (APPLAUSE) ... but I did it because housing is so important, and everybody is entitled to be treated fairly regardless of the color of their skin, regardless of their disability. And, you know, Hillary Clinton got out of law school and she could have gone to Wall Street, but instead she went to work with the Children's Defense Fund, fighting to advance civil rights and the juvenile justice system in South Carolina, the education system in Alabama. So this is what I did early and this is what Hillary did early. And let me tell you about Trump's early career. He came into a family business and shortly after he got deeply involved in it, he got sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against people based on the color of their skin -- a massive housing lawsuit brought by the Justice Department. And the evidence was when applications would come in, if somebody had dark skin, Latino or African-American, they would put a C on the application, and that would be the signal for that person to get second-class treatment. We do not need a president who thinks that any American should get second-class treatment. We're all equal in this country. (APPLAUSE) We all deserve first-class treatment. And we got to have a president who understands that. Now, right before I introduce Hillary, I just want to say this. This is the home stretch. You know, we -- we've done -- a number of us have done multiple Labor Day events already to celebrate Labor -- but also Labor Day is the start of the home stretch in the campaign. Between Labor Day and Election Day, that's when the focus is on and that's when the spotlight is the greatest, and that's when we have to do our best work. And, you know, let me -- you said, thanks for coming to Ohio. No, I am thanking you for coming out when we come to Ohio. (APPLAUSE) We got to come to Ohio. We have to come to Ohio. You all know this. You're used to this. You're used to the fact that you are one of the two or three most important states in any presidential election going back since there were presidential elections. And that's why we're here with you. Here's what we know about the next nine weeks, you're going to see a lot of negative ads on TV, right? I mean, Ted, you know the deal. A group can form and get money from some millionaire or billionaire. They can themselves, Citizens for Apple Pie. They don't tell you who they are. They put up a bunch of negative ads saying things that are largely false, and you can't connect them to it because they won't tell you who they are. Sadly, that's what campaigning has come to these days. But we, Democrats, we know how to do this because we learned how to do it from labor. We can beat all the negative ads. We can beat all the consultants. We can beat all the posters. And we can beat them by doing person-to-person, right? Isn't that what Ohio knows how to do? (APPLAUSE) And that's how we win -- even in a nation of 330 million people. You know, I'll tell you something, I think people now tune-out the negative ads. Sherrod had a ton of that money spent against him in 2012 just like I did, but people kind of tune it out because they look at it and they -- I don't know. They're not sure they can believe it. But can I tell you what they do believe, what people still believe deeply? They believe in a word from somebody they care about and from somebody they trust -- a neighbor, somebody in their church, somebody they go to school with, somebody they work with. If you reach out and talk to them, you can persuade somebody who's undecided or you can persuade somebody who is decided but may not vote that this is a very important election for the future of this country. Are you willing to do that, make that person-to-person -- person-to-person effort? (APPLAUSE) And I'll tell you something else. They don't even have to know you. They really don't even have to know you. If you call somebody or knock on their door and say, I'm a volunteer for Hillary Clinton, what they're going to hear is, volunteer. Well, they didn't have to do this. They're doing it because they're passionate about it. And our citizens who are trying to decide they want a word from somebody that they can talk to, somebody who can answer a question, you have the ability to make a difference and get people to take this seriously and see the consequences. And we know you know how to do it because Ohio always seems to figure out how to do it. So between now and November 8th, we're just asking, raise your hand if you are already volunteering for the campaign. All right. Give them a round of applause. That's great. For anybody who is not yet volunteering, you can do it. All you got to do is text ""Together"" to 47246. That's all you have to do -- ""Together"" 47246, and then you will be brought into the campaign, and we can work real hard to make history on November 8. And then the real work starts making history every day after November 8 with President Hillary Clinton. So now let me do a great introduction. I have had a wonderful honor to be on this ticket for Hillary. We just did an interview before I came over and somebody asked, what have you learned about her? And I said, I'll tell you something, I suspected about her, but I have learned it about her. This is one lady who never backs down. (APPLAUSE) This is one lady who never backs down. From the time she was a teenager in a Methodist youth group, she has been impassion and focused on the success of families and kids. And folks, whether she's been in office or out, whether she is winning or losing, whether she is getting something passed or having the other side knock it back, she does not forget where she came from. She does not forget what motivates her. And that's why I am so proud to say I'm with Hillary. We're with Hillary. We're going to make history with Hillary. Please welcome Hillary Clinton, the next president of the United States. (APPLAUSE)>
<CLINTON:> Hey, Cleveland. Happy, happy Labor Day. <APPLAUSE> When we were trying to figure out where we could be, we all said, ""Let's go to Cleveland."" <APPLAUSE> And I want to thank Congresswoman Marcia Fudge for hosting us. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Hillary. Hillary. Hillary.>
<CLINTON:> I haven't talked so every time I think about Trump I get allergic. <APPLAUSE> Boy, we have 63 days to go.
<AUDIENCE: 63 days. 63 days. 63 days.>
<CLINTON:> Well, thank you. Well -- well, you just heard the next vice president, didn't you? <APPLAUSE> In addition to thanking Marcia Fudge, let me also thank your great senator Sherrod Brown. Also -- excuse me. Also, two other great members of Congress, Tim Ryan and Joyce Beatty. <APPLAUSE> And your mayor, thanks to Mayor Jackson. <APPLAUSE> And I hope -- I hope that Ohio will send Ted Strickland to the Senate. <APPLAUSE> Now behind me are some of the great labor leaders of our country -- Randi Weingarten... <APPLAUSE> ... Lee Saunders... <APPLAUSE> ... Rich Trumka. <APPLAUSE> I'm proud to be on the same stage with them because they're always fighting for working families. Now, once I get over my allergic reaction... <LAUGHTER> ... let me say that, we are here in part because we know how important this election is to Ohio. It's not just, as Tim said -- that Ohio is one of the battleground states you hear about every four years. It's that Ohio represents everything that's great about America, and all of the challenges and the opportunities that we face. That's why this election is critical to every person in this state. And what I want to emphasize is I know we can't face our problems alone. We have to work together. We believe we are stronger together. And that is in stark contrast to Donald Trump. Remember what he said at his convention. He said, I, alone, can fix it. Now, think about what that leaves out, my friends. That leaves out all of our troops on the front lines. It leaves out our police officers and firefighters who run toward danger. It leaves out doctors and nurses who care for us. It leaves out teachers and educators who care for the most important people in our lives, our children. It leaves out everybody except him. And when he says, I, alone, can fix it, that clearly demonstrates he doesn't understand how America works, how we got great, and why we are great today, and what we need to do together to face the future. Because our campaign is about we will fix it together, we will work together, we will bring our country together. <APPLAUSE> And what better example of that are our labor unions. They are built... <APPLAUSE> ... on the principle of solidarity. They look out for each other. They fight for fair wages and collective bargaining for safe working conditions. Just last week, we learned once again because another study came out that confirms what we already knew. When more workers are in unions, wages are higher and not just for union members, but for all workers. <APPLAUSE> That's why if Tim and I are elected, we're going to say no to attacks on unions. No to rolling back collective bargaining. No to unfair trade deals like TPP. No to pension cuts that deny you the secure retirement that you've earned. No to right to work because right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America. <APPLAUSE> But we're not just about saying no. We're going to say yes to standing up for workers rights and dignity. Yes to good jobs and benefits. Yes to the American dream. It is big enough for everyone to share the promise. <APPLAUSE> And so, that's why during this campaign, I have been running a campaign based on issues, not insults. <APPLAUSE> I believe anyone who asks for your vote should tell you what they're going to do. Starting tomorrow, you can read about the plans Tim and I have because we're putting out a book. Did somebody have a copy of that book? Hey, somebody back there, you got a copy of the book I can show the crowd? We're putting out a book called ""Stronger Together."" <APPLAUSE> That's more than a slogan for the campaign. That's a guiding principle for the future we want to build, and that's exactly what we're going to do. Now some people say, wait a minute, you've got so many plans. Well, you're right, I do have plans. You know, why? Because I want you to know what I want to do to help you and what kind of results we're going to work to achieve. I have this old-fashioned idea that if you're asking somebody to vote for you, they ought to tell you what they want to do and then hold you accountable when you get elected. <APPLAUSE> And I'll tell you what, our plans start with a very simple idea, that we're going to get the economy to work for everyone, not just those at top. We're going to do it with the biggest investment in new jobs that we've had since World War II. More infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean renewable energy jobs. Anyone willing to work hard should have a job that can support them and their families, a job with dignity with only a future to be proud of, not to worry about. We're also going to offer new solutions for families. Families are different today than they were in the 1950s for heaven's sakes, so we need to make sure we help support families the way they are today, not way back when, helping people support and balance family and work with paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare. <APPLAUSE> And finally guaranteeing equal pay for women's work. <APPLAUSE> And here is our book. It's called ""Strong Together"" for a reason. You can read about what we want to do on the economy and everything else. It will be available starting tomorrow, because the choice for families has never been clearer. Just look at Donald Trump's track record when it comes to hardworking men and women. I know, I'm allergic to it, too, but we have to look at his record. There are many people you know who are thinking about voting for him. And you know, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. <APPLAUSE> And here is what you can tell among many things, he hired a union-busting firm to break up and organizing campaign at his hotel in Las Vegas. He built his career on refusing to pay workers, plumbers, painters, glass installers, marble installers, people who did work for him, and then he refused to pay them. He stiffs small businesses like my dad. My dad and Tim's dad had really small businesses that gave us a good middle-class life. I am just so grateful my father never got a contract from Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE> My dad worked hard. He printed drapery fabrics. And I would go help him sometimes. There'd be a long table in his print plant. And the fabric would be rolled out, and then the silk screens would be laid down, and then you pour the paint in, then you take the squeegee. You push it across the screen. You lift it up. You go all the way down and you go to the second table all the way back. Then when he finished, he'd load those drapery fabrics into his car and deliver them. I don't know what would have happened to my family if he had done a big job thinking it was a good deal for Trump and he gets there, and the Trump people say, we're not going to pay you. And then after harassing, maybe they say, OK, we'll pay you 30 cents on the dollar. He has driven hard-working people into bankruptcy and taken six bankruptcies himself. Now here in Ohio, you know very much that a president makes decisions that affect people's lives and livelihoods. When millions of jobs were on the line in the auto industry, President Obama made the right decision to save the auto industry. <APPLAUSE> I know we've got some UAW members here. <APPLAUSE> I was proud to support them then. I'm even prouder now that the auto industry just had its best year ever. <APPLAUSE> Think how differently things could have turned out. I know this is hard to imagine if it had been Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Last year -- remember this, last year, he said it didn't matter whether or not we save the auto industry. Either way would have been acceptable. He said we could have just let it go. Never mind the 850,000 people in Ohio and millions more across the country whose jobs and paychecks were tied to the auto industry. Now what else could we expect from someone whose most famous words are, you're fired? This is the kind of difference that this election really poses. People like Tim and me, who want to create more good jobs with rising wages and benefits for everybody willing to work hard, that's the basic bargain of America. And somebody who stiffed people to bankruptcy and laid off people, one of his bankruptcies put 1,000 people out of work. Every time you hear him talk about how he knows how to create jobs, just look at the facts. Educate yourself, and your friends, and your colleagues because, the kind of bluster and wild claims that he makes about everybody and everything don't stand up to any scrutiny. The same is true when it comes to whether we keep our country safe. Stronger together means working with our allies and our partners, right? <APPLAUSE> We're not just electing a president, we're electing a commander-in-chief. So when Donald Trump says, and I quote, ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do."" When he claims, as he has, that our Armed Forces are a disaster or he insults a Gold Star family, that's not just wrong and offensive, that's dangerous. Our military is a national treasure. And a president must respect the men and women who risk their lives and wear the uniform of our country. <APPLAUSE> Some of you know Tim Kaine's son is deployed right now. He's a Marine. <APPLAUSE> Tim and I will not only respect our men and women in uniform, we will protect them, and we will ensure that they are given the resources that they need to do the dangerous missions we ask them to do on our behalf. Last week, we saw even more evidence that Trump is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president. In just a few hours, he managed to turn his trip to Mexico into an embarrassing international incident. He even got into a Twitter war with the president of Mexico. And then he delivered his most hate-filled, hard, hard line speech yet -- doubling down on his absurd plans to send a deportation force to roundup 16 million people to deport them. Now, you can't make this stuff up, can you? He can try to distract with divisive dangerous rhetoric. He could try to fool voters into thinking somehow he's not as harsh and inhumane as he seems, but it's too late. When you see what he has said and done in this campaign, when you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear. Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief. <APPLAUSE> Imagine him in a real crisis. I've said it before, and I believe it -- a man you can bait with a tweet cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons. <APPLAUSE> Now, look, I know that these elections are always tight and hard. I am not taking anybody anywhere for granted. That's why we're here today because we need your help. We need to make sure we have an election that validates the kind of positive future that will make life better for the people of Ohio. And empty promises and raises to tax will do that. It won't get your family a job. It won't keep our troops safe. It won't heal the divides in America. I've spent my life fighting for kids and families. During the fight for health reforms, some of you remember, powerful interest blocked our way, but I didn't give up. I turned around. I worked with Republicans and Democrats to help pass the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids today. <APPLAUSE> That's how you deliver real results. You can't get discouraged. You can't give up. You can never quit. But you got to start from the right values and principles. You've got to believe in our country. You've got to believe in the American people. <APPLAUSE> I'm asking for your help in these next two months. I'm asking you to reach out to your friends, your neighbors, your family -- everybody you can possibly touch. I'm asking you to join this campaign. You can go to hillaryclinton.com or you could text ""Join,"" J-O-I-N, to 47246 because we want to win Ohio. <APPLAUSE> But you know, we don't want to just win it for the sake of winning it, we want to win it so that we can go onto the White House next January and get to work for you. <APPLAUSE> We want to win it so we can take all the plans and all the ideas that will improve your lives, that will get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, which will help make education affordable so college is within reach of everyone, and help you pay back your student debt. We want to defeat ISIS, keep our alliances strong. We want to break down the barriers that hold any American back. That's why we're running. We're not running because it's a nice thing to do after you have a reality TV show, right? We're running because between Tim and I, we have a lot of years -- a lot of years of public service. And we believe in what we can do together, and we believe that we can make our country even greater. So please join the campaign. Be part of us having an American future that is better than the past, that creates the opportunities for every single man, woman, and child. Thank you, and God bless you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-09-05"">
<CLINTON:> Hello. <APPLAUSE> Wow. Thank you all. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you so much. And it's wonderful to be back. I had such a good time last year. I said put that back on my calendar for Labor Day; I want to be on the banks of the Mississippi with friends from Illinois and Iowa talking about how we're going to make this economy work for everybody, not just those at the top. And it gives me such a great sense of real privilege and honor to be up on this stage with the people you see before you. Starting with my friend and former colleague, the great senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin, who has been in so many ways the conscience of the United States Senate. You heard him say he comes from a union family. He knows what hard work is. He stands up every day in that Senate. I hope you get a chance to watch him on C-SPAN sometime. Because he carries such passion and conviction in his voice about everything that he's fighting for. So thank to our friends from Illinois for sending Dick Durbin to the Senate for all the years and for however long he wants to be there. And please, be sure he is joined by Tammy Duckworth as your next senator. <APPLAUSE> Dick -- Dick reminded me that I endorsed Tammy here last year. I was looking for the fight occasion to do that. And I figured right here in her state would be the perfect opportunity. I just can't tell you how much I admire this brave woman. And she's going to bring so much to the Senate, to our national debate about issues that are critical to America's future. So please do everything you can to make sure that Tammy is in the Senate. <APPLAUSE> And let me also recognize and thank your congresswoman. Cheri Bustos, thank you. <APPLAUSE> Cheri has already made a great impression in the Congress. And she is working hard every day. She's another keeper. She's somebody who will only do more and more as she is there longer and has the chance to really make things happen for her constituents. I also want to recognize my friend, Congressman Dave Loebsack, from across the river, who was here earlier. <APPLAUSE> I don't think I need to remind everybody from Iowa, but please turn out and vote not only for Dave, but vote for Democrats. Vote for Patty Judge for Senate. Vote for other Democrats for Congress. <APPLAUSE> And it's a thrill to be here with three great union leaders, people who I admire and really appreciate the chance to work with, and look forward to working with as president: the UAW president, international, Dennis Williams; IBEW, international President Lonnie Stephenson; and of course, president of the NEA for the educators, Lily Eskelsen. <APPLAUSE> Now, each of these leaders are pretty special people, and I think you know Doug was pretty happy that they're here. He told me, ""We've got three international presidents here."" And I said knowing these three, they're happy to be here. This is not some kind of Labor Day obligation. They are with their members. They're working on behalf not only of those in the union, but we know, it was just proven again last week, that unions not only raise incomes and provide benefits for union members, but because of unions, everybody is better off. And that's a message I'm going to talk about every single day in this campaign. <APPLAUSE> Now, this is such a beautiful day, and you all came out here to celebrate Labor Day with all of us. And I am thrilled that I have a chance to just say a few words. I really believe we are stronger together. That was the theme of our convention. And coming out tomorrow, Tim Kaine and I have a book called ""Stronger Together."" And I'll tell you why we did this book. I think if you run for president, you ought to tell people what you want to do. Right? <APPLAUSE> And what I've tried to do in this book, and it's so great having Senator Kaine by my side now, is to lay out a blueprint for America's future. How are we going to get more good jobs? Infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean renewable energy jobs, how are we going to make sure that the economy not only is growing and producing more jobs with rising incomes but is being fair? So that people are treated fairly. That's why we support, we support raising the national minimum wage so that you're not living in poverty when you work full time. <APPLAUSE> My opponent thinks wages are too high. I don't know who he talks to, but he actually says that and he doesn't believe in raising the national minimum wage. I also believe in doing more to support small businesses. My dad was a small businessman, I believe that we need to do everything we can to help small businesses succeed. Tim Kaine and I were together in Cleveland earlier, we talked about that. Tim's dad ran a union shop, iron workers. And he's proud of that. That he had a small business father who ran a union shop and employed union workers providing good products. I also believe that we have to go finally guarantee equal pay for women's work. <APPLAUSE> And that's because I believe in fairness. I don't want to see anybody treated unfairly and discriminated against. I don't care who you are, if you're willing to work and do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. That is the basic bargain of America. So if you look at this book, which I hope you will, it stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump. He says, I alone can fix it. Now, the folks I have met during this campaign and for many years before, know that we have challenges, know we've got to come together and believe we have to work together to fix what our problems are, that's my view. I want us to bring people together just the way unions do, just the way people in communities do. And here in the quad cities and across the country, we can see proof every day that we have to come together to meet our challenges. So I'm going to continue to emphasize that we want to be the uniters in this campaign. We believe that America is already great and that we can become greater if we do our part. <APPLAUSE> When somebody says, I alone can fix it, think of the people he's leaving out, everybody else. Leaving out our troops on the front lines, leaving out firefighters and police officers who run toward danger, leaving our teachers and educators who do they best to change children's lives. Leaving out everybody else. That is his campaign in a nutshell and what we've got to do in the next 63 days is to present the vision of America we believe in. So we're going to continue to say, we're stronger together, we're going to work together, we're going to run a campaign of issues, not insults. And we are going to be absolutely strong in our support for unions, because we know... <APPLAUSE> Nobody gets through life alone. Unions help build the largest middle-class in the history of the world in our country. They fought for fair wages, safe working conditions. They've helped so many people get on that run to the middle-class. And their kids, like Dick Durbin, go even higher. So I am going to say no to a tax on unions. I am going to say no to rolling back collective bargaining. I am going to say no to unfair trade deals, like the TPP. I'm going to say no... <APPLAUSE> No to pension cuts that deny you the secure retirement that you have worked for, and I'm going to say no to right to work. It's not right for workers, and it is not right for America. <APPLAUSE> But I will say yes to the American dream and here's what I believe. The American dream is big enough for all of us. If we build it, we will expand it and create more opportunities. And as we run this campaign on issues, our most important -- our most important goal is getting the economy to work for everybody. There's nothing -- nothing more important. And how do you do that? By creating more jobs and what are some of the areas that I think we can really emphasize? Infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. <APPLAUSE> Also, what we can't see, our water systems, our sewer systems. We also need a new electric grid, a modern electric grid to be able to take and distribute clean, renewable energy. I have a goal for us to install a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term. <APPLAUSE> It takes a lot of -- a lot of jobs, a lot of people working to do that. And then enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term. <APPLAUSE> I also want to finish the work of broadband interconnectivity, we have places in our country that still have dial-up. We have places where kids can't do the homework assignments their teachers give them because they don't have access to the internet. That is so unfair. Think of all the jobs we'll create when we finish that off. And then let's look at advanced manufacturing. I believe we can compete with anybody if we put our minds to it, and I'm going to have a manufacturing renaissance policy that will put people to work. <APPLAUSE> I -- I am so proud that Dennis and Lonnie are here because they've been doing so much to really create the new industries and autos and what the IBEW does in so many important areas of our economy. I want to be your partner. And I think it's especially important to recognize that when the chips were down and the auto industry was on its back, President Obama did the right thing. He saved the American auto industry. <APPLAUSE> I supported him then and I support him just as strongly now. The American auto industry just had the best year it's had in a long time and that was because of the teamwork and the partnership that we had between the companies. Between the union and because the president of the United States knew we had to save the auto industry. Donald Trump basically said, he didn't care, didn't matter to him. It just shows you how he doesn't understand or care about the real jobs that put bread on the table and give people a sense of purpose and dignity. Well you won't have to look far to find me in the Oval Office, if I'm fortunate enough to be your president, and to do everything I can, every single day to create more jobs, to save jobs, to bring jobs back from overseas. <APPLAUSE> And if you contrast that with Trump, his track record -- his track record is just the opposite. He actually hired a union busting firm for one of his hotels in Las Vegas. He built a career out of not paying workers for the work they did. We're talking painters, plumbers, electricians, people who thought it was a big deal working for Donald Trump, one of his resorts, his casinos. He stiffed them. He stiffs small businesses. Like I said, my dad was a small businessman, he printed drapery fabrics. He'd get an order, he'd buy the material, he'd get the silk screens made. I would go sometimes to help him in his print plant. He'd have these long tables, the fabric would be laid out. You would take the silk screen, you'd put it down, you'd pour the paint in, you'd take the squeegee, you'd push it across, you'd lift the screen up, you go all the way down, get on the next table, all the way back. Took a lot of time. Took a lot of hard work. When he finished, he'd load up the fabrics in his car and he'd go deliver them. I am so happy he never got a contract from Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE> I don't know what my family would've done if my dad did business with people like Trump, who has told hundreds and hundreds of small business, he's been sued 4,000 times for not paying the bills that he owes. If my dad had been told, sorry just kidding, we're not paying you -- this is the man who wants to be President of the United States? This is someone who doesn't even honor contracts? That's what is so dangerous about this election. What Donald Trump says, what he says about the economy, that he knows how to create jobs. He had six bankruptcies. In one bankruptcy alone, 1,000 people lost their jobs. The numbers add up. He talks about wanting to protect jobs in America but everything he makes, he's made overseas. He could have made suits and ties and furniture in the United States but no, he made it overseas. He even hires workers from overseas. And he tells people well, he couldn't find Americans who wanted to work in the heat. You can't make this stuff up, can you? It is truly unbelievable. But what's even worse is what he says about foreign policy. As bad as he is about our economy, he has insulted our allies, he has made common cause with dictators, he has basically endorsed Vladimir Putin and his policies. When he says, ""I know more about ISIS than the generals""; when he claims our armed forces are a disaster, or he insults a Gold Star family, that's not just offensive. That's dangerous. And just today, our intelligence professionals said there was credible evidence for them to pursue an investigation into Russia's efforts to interfere with our election, hacking the Democratic National Committee. And when Putin was asked about it, didn't deny it. In fact, he said it was probably a good thing it happened. And this is the person that Donald Trump praises. We saw even more evidence last week that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president. In just a few hours, he managed to turn his trip to Mexico into an embarrassing international incident. I mean, just look at what happened. He got into a Twitter war with <inaudible>. And why? Because the president of Mexico said, ""I told him in the meeting we weren't paying for that wall."" <APPLAUSE> So, not only did Trump mess up his first international engagement, he choked. He couldn't even bring himself to tell the president of Mexico one of his very few policy demands. I mean, he went back to Arizona and gave another hate-filled speech about rounding up and deporting 16 million people. Even some of his own advisers are having a hard time explaining that away. So he's going to try to distract and divide. He's going to hope that we don't pay attention to what he's been saying for 14, 15 months. And we just tune in now, these last two months, that he's somehow softening his positions; that there's a really another Donald Trump out there. Well, you've got to ask yourself, if you can't even go to a friendly foreign country without getting into a fight, can this person even claim to have the temperament to be in the Oval Office and deal with real urgent crises? As I've said before, and I'll say it again, a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere nuclear weapons. <APPLAUSE> But we have a lot of work to do. I think every election is close and tight and tough. That's why we have to work as hard as we can between now and when the last votes are counted. And that's why I need your help. I want to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. I want to be sure that we lead the world with strength and steadiness, and that we protect America here at home and around the world. And I want to unify our country. I believe with all my heart... <APPLAUSE> ... that every American must vote, must vote. I see a woman holding a sign, ""you must vote."" Please, it will make a difference. And then she says ""I'm a Gold Star daughter."" <APPLAUSE> God bless you. God bless you. I spent my life fighting for kids and families. I don't give up. I don't quit. When we didn't get health care reform, I went to work with Republicans and Democrats. We passed the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures 8 million kids every year. <APPLAUSE> As Dick said, after we were attacked on 9/11, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to make sure we could rebuild New York and the Pentagon, and make sure we were as safe as we possibly could be. This election will determine so much about our future. And one thing I know for sure is we have to start listening to and respecting each other again. We may have differences. That's the American way. But we are stronger together. We can do anything if we put our minds to it. I saw the picture of Mother Theresa that was being held up here. And I was fortunate to know Mother Theresa. I was fortunate enough to actually work with her. We didn't agree on everything, but we found common ground. She asked me when I was first lady to get a home for babies started in Washington, so mothers who couldn't care for their babies could take their babies to a safe place and those babies could be adopted. <APPLAUSE> And when Mother Theresa asked you to do something, the only answer was ""Yes, ma'am."" <LAUGHTER> And I started working. And she would call me. She'd call me from India. She'd call me from Vietnam. She called me from everywhere. She'd say, ""Where's my home?"" <LAUGHTER> And I'd say, ""Well, Mother, working with the Washington, D.C. Zoning Department requires divine intervention."" <LAUGHTER> And so she did, and we got it done. <APPLAUSE> Here's what I hope you will do. I hope you will get involved in this campaign for these last two months. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and see how you can work in Illinois, in Iowa. I hope you will text JOIN -- J-O-I-N, and go to 47246, to see what you can do. We need everybody involved. There has never been a more important consequential election in our lifetimes. <APPLAUSE> And we need to elect progressive leaders like Tammy and Cheri and Dave Loebsack and others who are on the ballot as well. I am confident and optimistic about America's future. When I listened to Donald Trump, when I watched his convention, I honestly did not know what country he was talking about. It was so dark, so dire, so depressing. That's not the America I know. It's not the America that I see. I don't deny that we have problems. Of course, we do. We're human beings. But my goodness, would you live anywhere else? <APPLAUSE> Would you give up our freedom, our values, our opportunity for anywhere else? I traveled to 112 countries as your secretary of state. And everywhere I went, I was so proud to land that plane which said ""The United States of America"" on it, and to come down those stairs and begin to meet on behalf of our values, our interests and our security. And there is not a place, despite what they say, that doesn't envy who we are and what we have. We cannot put any of that at risk my friends. <APPLAUSE> So for these last two months, join this campaign, help us make history, make sure that we are continuing to be not just great, but even greater. And that we're creating opportunities for the next generation, like my grandchildren. That's what we can do together if we remember we are stronger together. God bless you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-09-06"">
<CLINTON:> I know I'm only the second most exciting thing that's happened here in the last few days. <LAUGHTER> Your big win to open your football season, got... <APPLAUSE> Got some attention. But I am always happy to be at a university that is doing such a superb job in preparing the next generation of students. I had the great privilege of speaking to your president, Dr. Genshaft. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> And I will talk in a minute about some of what I've learned about USF and why I think a lot of what you do here is a model for what we need to do in higher education. But for me, it's exciting to be here with so many friends. I want to start by thanking <inaudible> who just introduced me, Air Force Reservist, former commander of the 927th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, a woman who has served her country with honor and distinction. I would be proud to be her commander-in-chief. <APPLAUSE> I want to thank your extraordinary mayor, Bob Buckhorn. <APPLAUSE> Bob is an example of the kind of leader who gets things done by bringing people together, setting big goals and working to achieve them. That's exactly what I want to do as president, and I look forward to working with Bob and the people of this great city and region. That includes a longtime friend of mine, State Senator Arthenia Joyner. <APPLAUSE> I have known Arthenia long before she was in elected office, but she's always been an activist, always trying to make things better for people. I've known her for -- oh, I hate to admit it -- 25 years. <LAUGHTER> And I am so grateful she is my friend. This is the countdown to one of the most important elections in our lifetimes. No matter what your age, this is going to determine so much about your futures, the futures of our children and grandchildren. The stakes could not be higher.
<CLINTON:> Everyone knows what an important state Florida is, and it's not just because its always a hard-fought state, it's because Florida shows all of the excitement, the dynamism, the opportunities, as well as the challenges and problems that we have to face together. So we have 62 days -- 62 days to make the case. And I can't do it without you. And I'm here... <APPLAUSE> I'm here to lay out my case one more time and to ask for your help, because every single vote counts. Our campaign set a goal in July, we launched a drive to register three million Americans to vote this election. We have hosted thousands of events across the country, including right here in Florida. And today, I'm asking every one of you to give us some of your precious time to be part of this campaign. And I'm going to run through some of the reasons why every single person here has a real stake in making sure our country heads into the future with confidence and optimism, that we truly are stronger together, because that's what will determine whether we have the economy that produces more good jobs with rising incomes, whether we have an education system that prepares our young people for the jobs of the future, whether college is affordable, whether student debt can be paid back, whether our health care system works, whether we lead the world with strength and steadiness, working with allies and partners to make sure that we move toward peace and prosperity. There is an exciting, bold agenda before us, but it cannot be done by any one person. It must be done by all of us, and that is something that Donald Trump does not understand. <APPLAUSE> Among the many troubling things that were said at his convention -- and honestly, I sometimes didn't recognize what country they were talking about. It was so dire, so dark, so divisive, so dangerous. But among the things he said was, ""I alone can fix it."" <BOOING> Think of who that leaves out. Our men and women in uniform, troops on the front line, people like Mary who put on the uniform of the Air Force to serve our country. Think about the police and firefighters who rushed toward danger, think about those brave police officers and emergency responders in Orlando when the Pulse Nightclub was attacked. <APPLAUSE> Think about all the teachers, the educators, the professors, the staff who work to give young people a much better chance in the race of life. Think about all the hard working people who can't build a house by themselves, can't erect one of Donald Trump's skyscrapers by themselves. Think of all the small businesses that take a big chance. My dad was a small business man; I know what a chance it is. He couldn't do it alone; he needed customers, he needed suppliers, he needed workers. Americans don't say, I alone can fix it. We say, we'll fix it together; just watch us. Nobody -- nobody can solve problems better than we can.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> And I want to be a president for all Americans, not some Americans; Democrats, Republicans, Independents, every single American. <APPLAUSE> I want to be a president for those who vote for me and those who vote against me because I want to bring our country together. <APPLAUSE> I'm very proud that Tim Kaine and I are running a campaign of issues, not insults. <APPLAUSE> Because I believe anybody who is asking for your vote for the most important job not just in the country but in the world should tell you what they plan to do. I do have this -- I guess it's an old- fashioned idea. If you're going to ask people for their vote, they ought to have some idea what they're voting for. And I don't think it's enough to say oh, I'll tell you later. <LAUGHTER> I think it's important to lay it out and to tell you how it's going to be paid for. And that's why, starting today and especially for young people but really for everybody, we are putting out a book. It's called, ""Stronger Together."" And in it... <APPLAUSE> It shows this is more than a slogan for the campaign. This is a blueprint for America's future. <APPLAUSE> Among the things that we talk about is the core of our agenda. As laid out in this book, it is building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. <APPLAUSE> Infrastructure jobs, like those here at the port. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, they need work and there are millions of jobs to be done. <APPLAUSE> And in addition to what you can see, what about our water systems, our sewer systems? We need a new, modern electric grid to be able to take in clean, renewable energy that can then move us toward that future we see. <APPLAUSE> I have a plan to install a half a billion solar panels by the end of my first term. <APPLAUSE> And enough clean energy to power every home in America by the end of my second term. <APPLAUSE> And I want young people especially to be part of this, to be in science, technology, engineering, manufacturing, creating this future that will determine the quality of your lives and the competitiveness of our economy. We also have to finish extending broadband access to every place in America. <APPLAUSE> Right now, 70 percent of our teachers say that they assign homework to their students starting in elementary school. They require the kids to learn how to use the internet, I think that's great. We want to have an internet-savvy population. But here's the problem. Five million homes where little kids live, where high school kids live don't have the internet. What does that mean? That means they're already behind. It's so unfair. We're going to make this economy grow but we're also going to make it fair. We're going to have more advanced manufacturing jobs.
<CLINTON:> I think we made a mistake years ago, when we eliminated what used to be called vocational education. <APPLAUSE> We've got to return technical education to our high schools, our community colleges. There are right now more than a million jobs that can be filled by people who are machinists, computer designers, tool and die makers. But for whatever reason, they haven't been given the chance to get that training. And maybe they've been told, ""You know what? The only future is to go to a great university like USF."" Well, that is true for a lot of people, but it's not true for everybody. And we need to make the hard work that builds America the kind of great work with respect and purpose that is going to attract a new generation. <APPLAUSE> That's why you'll read what I want to do in here. We're going to try to make community college free. We're also going to have apprenticeship programs. <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> I'm going to give a tax credit to any company that is willing to pay a young person while that young <inaudible> parents made. It's time for us to step up and build America's future. And let's make it fair while we do that. That's why I've said we're going to emphasis the importance of small businesses. Right now, small businesses are having a tough time in Florida and across America getting access to credit, right? And getting the kinds of regulations and overlapping expectations and standards that don't really make sense. I want to make it clean and clear. And I particularly want young people with an idea for a small business to feel that they can do it. So I have proposed a moratorium for three years on student debt, so you can actually get a business off the ground, get it started, make your future. <APPLAUSE> I also believe we should raise the national minimum wage. Anybody working full time should not be living in poverty. <APPLAUSE> And finally, let's guarantee equal pay for women's work, which will raise family income. <APPLAUSE> Anyone who's willing to work hard should have enough money to raise a family. Did anybody of you watch any of the Democratic convention? <APPLAUSE> Well, I don't know if you saw these two young people, 17-years- old from Kansas. Young man, young woman. Went to the same high school, about to be seniors, get a summer job working in a pizza restaurant in their home town, they're pretty excited. I remember when I had what I thought of as my first real job. Not baby sitting, not you know, just kind of knocking around, but a real job where I had to actually show up someplace and get a paycheck. That was pretty exciting. So a young man, young woman were at our convention, here's the story they told. They were talking together one day after work, they'd known each other. And the young woman said, ""You know, I'm excited, because I think I'm actually going to be able to save some money for college making $8 an hour."" And her friend, the young man looked at her and he goes, ""I'm making $8.15 an hour."" And the young woman said, ""Well, you didn't have any experience before this job doing this, did you?"" He said, ""No, you know I didn't."" He <sic> said, ""Well, what do you think happened?"" The young man said, ""Oh, it must be a mistake."" So they together, and I give the young man a lot of credit -- good guy, right?<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> They go to tell the manager that there's been a mistake. They're doing exactly the same job. He's making $0.15 more an hour. What happens? The manager fired them both. <BOOING> And you know what? That's legal. If you find out about somebody else's salary even if you're doing exactly the same job?, you can be retaliated against, including being fired in most places. So, when I say let's have equal pay, and some people I see looking quizzical at me, they say well, of course you've got to have equal pay. Well, yeah, if you're in the military and the pay scale is set or you're in the government and it's set or you're under a union contract and it's set. But if you're in the vast majority of jobs in America, you have no idea whether you're being paid fairly. So, we can not let that continue. That's wrong in America. If you're doing the job, you deserve to get the pay. <APPLAUSE> And so how are we going to fund this? Well, I'll tell you. We're going where the money is. We're going to the people who've made the money in the last 15 years. We're going to the top one-tenth percent; the millionaires, the billionaires. They're going to have to start paying for supporting our military, supporting our education system, supporting our health care system. <APPLAUSE> There could not be a bigger contrast between what I've proposed when it comes to taxes and what Donald Trump has proposed. He actually has proposed giving trillions -- and I mean that with a T -- trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, billionaires and Wall Street money managers. <BOOING> That would not only explode our national debt, it would lead to massive cuts in education and health care. And many of his proposals would really benefit his own family but do nothing for the remaining 99-plus percent of Americans. And in fact, independent analysts have said this. They've looked at our plans -- he doesn't have much in the way of plans but they've looked at what he has said -- and they've concluded, if we did what Trump is recommending, we would lose 3.5 million jobs in four years. If we do what I'm recommending, we stand to gain over 10 million jobs in the next four years. <APPLAUSE> And among the things that I want to do is make sure we have an education system from early childhood through adulthood. And that means I want universal pre-k, I want to help more kids get a better start so that when they get to kindergarten and first grade, they're ready to learn. I want to work with our teachers and educators, I respect teachers and educators, and I want to give them the support they need to do the job we ask. <APPLAUSE> And I want to support universities like this one. Now, here's one of the reasons why. Fifty thousand students, 40 percent on Pell Grants. A lot of people would never have gotten an education if it weren't for the federal Pell Grant program. Right? <APPLAUSE> But here's what's most impressive. A lot of schools have a lot of Pell Grants. This university graduates all categories of students at the same rate. If you're a Pell Grant student, a non-Pell Grant student, if you're white, African-American, Latina, a Latino, Asian, everybody graduates at the same rate.
<CLINTON:> And why that happens is because this university makes a particular commitment to every student and moves as quickly as possible to help kids who maybe are first generation college students, right? <APPLAUSE> I -- you know, I've got to tell you, when I got to college -- now, my father went to college on a football scholarship. I knew I wasn't going to college on a football scholarship. <LAUGHTER> My mother had a really difficult childhood; she never got to go to college. So my dad couldn't really tell me much about going to college because he basically paid -- played football for four years and loved it. My mom couldn't tell me. So when I got to college, I felt so out of place. I was so nervous. There used to be something way back in the dark ages called collect phone calls. <LAUGHTER> Where you would call collect, which meant that your parents had to pay for it, and you just waited to see whether they'd accept it. So I called home and I said I can't -- I can't do this, it's too hard, everybody here is smarter than I am. They're better prepared than I am, I want to come home. And my father, who didn't want me to go so far away to school anyway, he said, ""Come home."" <LAUGHTER> And my mother said, ""No, you have to stick it out and if you feel the same way at the end of the year then you can make a different decision."" Of course, my mother was right; I loved it within a month or two. But I know what it feels like to show up and wonder can you make it? Are you good enough? Are you smart enough? And thank goodness USF has people waiting to mentor and reassure and guide students. Every single college and university needs to have that. And then we've got to make it affordable so kids don't have to leave because they no longer have the funding that they need. <APPLAUSE> And I want to do more in my effort to make childcare affordable. No family should have to pay more than 10 percent of your income on childcare. And right now, you have a lot of states where it costs more for childcare than tuition at college and university. So I'm going to do -- I know you've got childcare here, but as I told the president, I want to do more to help you to make sure every student, parent has a safe place to bring their child while they're studying and working and trying to get their education. And then we're going to help everybody with student debt. How many of you have student debt? <APPLAUSE> We're going to help you pay it back and pay it off quickly. We're going to get the interest rates down, we're going to give you new ways of paying it. <APPLAUSE> Because right now, we have too may people laboring under student debt in a way that holds your own futures back. So we're going to lift that burden off of you and we're also going to make sure you can get quality, affordable health care. Every age you are, every place you are, we're going to get the costs down, premiums, co-pays, deductibles and especially prescription drug costs. <APPLAUSE> And there are two other things we're going to take on because I've heard about this all across America. We're going to take on helping more people with mental health and addiction problems get the help you need.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> So I'm excited about what we can do, to create an economy and education and health care system that works, and while we do it, we're going to be protecting the rights of Americans, all Americans. We have fought too hard, we have come too far. And that means civil rights and it means women's rights and gay rights and voter rights and workers rights and disability rights. <APPLAUSE> And you know, I believe with all my heart because I've done this work my entire life. I was looking at the disability sign there. My first job out of law school was with the Children's Defense Fund. I did a lot of interesting things, and one of them was to gather evidence about why so many kids with disabilities were out of school. There was no requirement that you went to school if you were blind, deaf, in a wheelchair, and we changed the law. The first nation in the world to do that and I am so proud of our country. <APPLAUSE> So these rights are not for somebody else. We all know somebody. We all know a woman. We all know somebody in a racial or ethnic minority. We all know a worker or a voter. We all know a gay person and we all know somebody with a disability. These are our rights, and the kinds of things that you've been hearing from Donald Trump, demeaning, defaming groups of Americans, people who have every right to be respected by someone who wants to be president of the United States and he stands there and mocks a reporter with a disability and he calls women pigs and he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals... <BOOING> And he demeans Muslims and attacks a Gold Star family whose son died in action in Iraq. That's not who we are. So yes, we have a lot of plans but we also have values, my friends. And we're going to stand up for American values. <APPLAUSE> Our book also outlines how we're going to keep our country safe from all threats. We're going to work with our allies, not insult them. We're going to stand up to our adversaries, not cozy up to them. We're going to have real plans, not claims and secret plans. This November, the American people have a big choice to make when it comes to national security. On the one hand, we have Donald Trump, who has called the American military a disaster. <BOOING> Who disrespects our military leaders by saying, and I quote, ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do."" His companies -- and listen to this because I know there are a lot of veterans and a lot of you know active duty people based here in Tampa. His companies -- Trump companies have fired veterans because they had to take time off to fulfill their military commitments.<BOOING>
<CLINTON:> And we all saw him disparage the Khans, a Gold Star family who lost their son in a car bomb explosion in Iraq as he ran toward it to prevent the loss of life of people in his unit and saving hundreds of his fellow soldiers. And when asked why he would insult a Gold Star family, he suggested that his sacrifices are somehow comparable to theirs because he said, and again, I quote... <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> We're going to bolster our defenses, including with an intelligence surge, to protect us and our allies. We will do whatever is necessary for as long as it takes to bring ISIS to justice and end their reign of terror once and for all. <APPLAUSE> And I will tell you this. I am a very patient person. I don't quit, I don't give up, I don't blink. This Sunday will be the 15th anniversary of the attack of 9/11. I was a senator from New York. I knew people who were killed. I worked with families and the few survivors. I worked to get the health care needed by our first responders and emergency workers who ran toward danger. <APPLAUSE> I worked to make our country safer and to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, but I always, always was determined to do anything I could to bring Bin Laden to justice. <APPLAUSE> And thanks to the very patient, painstaking work of the American intelligence community, finally, when I was secretary of State, we were given the opportunity to evaluate the best evidence we had seen in a long time and I was honored to be part of that small group in the situation room advising President Obama as we went through the evidence over and over and over again, trying to decide was it credible enough, strong enough to take action. And if we did, what kind of action. Would it be a missile strike? Would it be a bombing? Would it be an attack by special forces? And when it came time to go around the table, these were all extremely experienced, thoughtful experts. We all gave our opinions. I was one who said I thought it was worth the risk and I was... <APPLAUSE> And I was in that small situation room on that day. You all know the story. Some of you read the book, some of you have seen the movies, but there's one thing I want to tell you because it demonstrates again what our values are as Americans. Remember, Donald Trump has said he would order American troops to torture, he would order American troops to murder family members of terrorists. That's what he has said, heedless of the consequences that that would lead to in terms of putting Americans all over the world at even greater risk. Here's what happened that night in Pakistan. This is not an often told part of the story. So I want to tell you, particularly the young people here, particularly active duty and military veterans like Mary. If you saw any of the reenactment, you know that one of the helicopters clipped its tail as it was going into the courtyard on the wall.
<CLINTON:> It disabled that helicopter. Now, thankfully, every contingency had been thought through, and so we were prepared for that. The military was prepared. They could get another helicopter there to take out the SEALs who were going to have to blow up the disabled helicopter. After rushing into the compound, taking out the two body guards, taking out Bin Laden's adult son, taking out Bin Laden, they knew they had to get out of there. At any time, there could have been Pakistani military wondering, what's going on? Something's happening. This was a military garrisoned town. So time was really precious. And here's what the SEALs did. Before they blew that helicopter up, they took out all the women and children. Family members of terrorists, including the worst terrorist of all. They took them out of the compound, around the back to safety before they blew that helicopter up. That, Donald Trump, is what American honor looks like. <APPLAUSE> I want to mention just three other threats. One threat here right at home -- the epidemic of gun violence. And we have got to have comprehensive background checks, close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and the ability of people on the terrorist watch list buying a gun in America. This agenda I've just briefly outlined is supported by a vast majority of Americans and a vast majority of American gun owners, and it's time we all said in one voice, hey, we can respect the Second Amendment, we can respect the right to own arms, but we don't want people who shouldn't have guns in the first place killing anybody else ever again. <APPLAUSE> Another threat to our country is climate change. 2015 was the hottest year on record, and the science is clear. It's real, it's reeking havoc on communities across America. Last week's hurricane was another reminder of the devastation that extreme weather can cause, and I send my thoughts and prayers to everyone affected by Hermine. But this is not the last one that's going to hit Florida, given what's happening in the climate. Nobody knows that better than folks right here in Tampa and in the broader region. Sea levels have been rising here about an inch per decade since the 1950s. At the rate we are going, by 2030, which is not that far away, $70 billion of coastal property in this state will be flooding at high tide. And whenever our infrastructure is threatened, so too is our homeland security. The next president will have to work with communities like Tampa's to prepare for future storms.
<CLINTON:> When I'm in the Oval Office, I'm going to work with local leaders to make smart investments in infrastructure to help protect regions from flooding and other effects of climate change. I'm going to continue to work on the international and national level to try to turn the clock back, to stabilize and reduce emissions even more, to try to gain more time. But we're going to have to begin working immediately on mitigation and resilience and prevention as well. <APPLAUSE> And what about Donald Trump? Well, he doesn't even believe in climate change. He says it's a hoax invented by the Chinese. And he says, quote, ""You can't get hurt with extreme weather."" Now, this is the same guy who at one of his golf courses in some coastal place has demanded that a seawall be built to protect his golf course from rising tides. So it's all fine if it affects Donald, but if affects the rest of humanity he could care less. If it affects people who lose their homes or their businesses that took a lifetime to build, doesn't matter to him. When it comes to protecting our country against natural disasters and the threat of climate change, once again Donald Trump is totally unfit and unqualified to be our president. <APPLAUSE> And let's not forget the next president also has to keep our country safe from public health crises like Zika. It's painfully obvious we can't rely on the Republican Congress or Republican governors to fund an adequate response. <APPLAUSE> They can't help themselves from playing games, even when lives are on the line. I call on all Republicans to put people before politics and finally vote in favor of a clean funding bill to fight Zika right here in Florida. <APPLAUSE> But the failure of the Republicans in Congress, including your Republican senator, means that we can't always count on them, can we? So last month, I announced that as president I will create a public health rapid response fund to be available when emergencies occur, to have a consistent budget to better enable government agencies at all levels to quickly respond to major public health crises and pandemics.
<CLINTON:> This will complement our efforts to prepare our country to deal with those challenges and because of climate change, we're going to have more of them. Because of mobility around the world, you can get on a plane in Africa and bring Ebola to the United States. You could be a mosquito in Brazil and make your way to Florida. We've got to be better prepared. It's always better to invest a penny in the front-end than to have to pay many dollars after the crisis has already occurred. <APPLAUSE> That's why it is time that when we talk about protecting public health to put politics aside and put our people's needs first. Now, I'm excited about doing all of this with you, for you, on your behalf, but I can't do it without you. And here's what I'm asking. The deadline to register voters is October 11th. If any of you are not registered or you're not sure you are registered or you're a student and you're registered somewhere else but it would be more convenient to vote here, you have until October 11th. So please, learn how to register. You can go to iwillvote.com and learn how to do that. You can go to my website, Hillaryclinton.com and learn how to do that. We are also building volunteer teams so you can get involved by going to Hillaryclinton.com or text ""join,"" J-O-I-N, to 47246, or you can sign up here today. Are there people with clipboards somewhere around here on the way out I guess? You can sign up here today to have a volunteer registration shift. And you can also apply if you're really interested to our Get Out The Vote Fellowship program. We're going to organize special groups to get people to the polls and we need you. This state has so much promise and I want to be the best president that you could possibly have in Florida. I want to work on all of these issues, everything that's in this blueprint that we have published. And I want particularly to give the young people of this university, this state, this country the best shot you can have to be part of the American dream however you define that. Many of us... <APPLAUSE> Many of us who came before know that there were barriers in the way. When I was a young woman, there were schools I couldn't go to, jobs I couldn't get, scholarships I wasn't eligible for just because I was a woman. And a lot of those barriers have been knocked down. For every African American, Latino, Asian American, Native American, gay American, you know that barriers have been knocked down. But they're not all down. And we've got to make sure they're all gone and that no demagogue can ever bring them back and can ever exploit the fears and insecurities of the American people. <APPLAUSE> So please vote this year like your future depends on it, because it does. And if you give me the great honor of serving as your president, I will get up every single day in that White House and I will work my heart out for those better jobs, better educational opportunities, better health care with quality and affordability, protecting our rights, protecting our country, unifying America.
<CLINTON:> Because we need to be the United States, not the divided states of America. <APPLAUSE> And yes, remember, as that sign over there says, I believe this too, love trumps hate. Let's have a future that proves that's true. Thank you all, God bless you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-09-08"">
<CLINTON:> Good morning, good morning. Good morning, everyone. Last night, I was very glad to be able to begin a conversation with the American people, and offer some of my thoughts about ISIS, Iran, and how we reform the V.A. system to provide better care for our vets. And I'm honored that in the last 24 hours, more retired generals and admirals have decided to endorse my campaign. To focus more on these crucial challenges, tomorrow I'm convening a meeting of bipartisan national security leaders and experts, including former secretaries of homeland security, Michael Chertoff and Janet Napolitano; General John Allen; former acting director of the CIA Michael Morell; and former NATO supreme allied commander James Stavridis, and others. We will discuss how to intensify our efforts to defeat ISIS and keep our country safe. To that end, I want to underscore something that I mentioned last night. We should make it a top priority to hunt down the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and bring him to justice just as we did with Osama bin Laden. As with that operation, getting al-Baghdadi will require a focused effort driven at the highest levels. But I believe it will send a resounding message that nobody directs or inspires attacks against the United States and gets away with it. Let me be clear: Last night was yet another test, and Donald Trump failed yet again. We saw more evidence that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be commander in chief. He trash-talks American generals, saying they've been, quote, ""reduced to rubble."" He suggested he would fire them and replace them with his hand-picked generals. He attacked dozens of former flag officers by saying that, quote, ""We've <sic> been losing for us for a long time."" That's how he talks about distinguished men and women who have spent their lives serving our country, sacrificing for us. That's how he would act as commander in chief. Meanwhile, bizarrely once again, he praised Russia's strongman Vladimir Putin, even taking the astonishing step of suggesting that he prefers the Russian president to our American president. Now, that is not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country, as well as to our commander in chief. It is scary because it suggests he will let Putin do whatever Putin wants to do, and then make excuses for him.
<CLINTON:> I was just thinking about all of the presidents that would just be looking at one another in total astonishment. What would Ronald Reagan say about a Republican nominee who attacks America's generals and heaps praise on Russia's president? I think we know the answer. And when asked how he would stop the spread of global terrorism, Trump's answer was simply ""take the oil."" The United States of America does not invade other countries to plunder and pillage. We don't send our brave men and women around the world to steal oil. And that's not even getting into the absurdity of what it would involve: massive infrastructure, large numbers of troops, many years on the ground. Of course, Trump hasn't thought through any of that. Every Republican holding or seeking office in this country should be asked if they agree with Donald Trump about these statements. Now, one thing you didn't hear from Trump last night is any plan to take on ISIS, one of the biggest threats facing our country. He says his plan is still a secret, but the truth is he simply doesn't have one. And that's not only dangerous. It should be disqualifying. So I have a very different vision for how we keep our country safe and strong. I respect the men and women who put their lives on the line to serve America. I will work with our allies to defeat ISIS. And I will hold true to our country's most cherished values. You know, even with all of the attention paid to the campaign, we cannot forget how important this decision is. This weekend is the 15th anniversary of 9/11. I will never forget the horror of that day, but I will never forget either the victims and survivors, and the brave first responders and emergency responders that I met with and served and worked for as senator from New York. That's what kept me working so hard in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families. That's who I was thinking of 10 years later in the White House situation room with President Obama when the decision was made to bring Osama bin Laden to justice. That's the kind of commander in chief I will be, someone who will bring us together in common purpose to keep our people safe and our country strong.
<QUESTION: Madam Secretary, the latest Real Clear Politics average has you up by an average of 2.8 percentage points over Donald Trump. Given what you say are his historic inadequacies and disqualification on the commander in chief point that you just made, shouldn't you just basically be running away with it at this point? >
<CLINTON:> Well, as I've said many, many times, I've always thought this was going to be a close election. That's why we've been putting organizations in place, gearing up for these final weeks, to mobilize and turn out our voters. That's exactly what we're going to do. And I feel we're in a strong position, but we're not taking anyplace, anyone, anything for granted. We're going to keep working as hard as we can and hopefully pull out as many voters who agree with me as we possibly can muster. <CROSSTALK>
<CLINTON:> Hi, Jeff <ph>.
<QUESTION: You said unequivocally last night that you would not put troops into Iraq ever again. Isn't, A, that ignoring some ground forces who are there; and B, boxing yourself in should your military commanders, if elected, advise that you in fact need to do that?>
<CLINTON:> Well, Jeff <ph>, first of all, I've said that before. I've said it on numerous occasions. I believe it. I think putting a big contingent of American ground troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria would not be in the best interest of the fight against ISIS and other terrorist groups. In fact, I think it would fulfill one of their dearest wishes, which is to drag the United States back into a ground war in that region. However, I've been very clear, and I said this again last night, I support the air campaign. I support special forces. I support enablers. I support surveillance, intelligence and reconnaissance. I will absolutely be prepared to do whatever is necessary to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground to take out as much of the infrastructure of ISIS from the air; to go after Baghdadi, as I said today, with a very focused commitment to taking him off the battlefield.
<CLINTON:> I think the approach I've outlined intensifies what we are doing, but also recognizes that there is no, in my opinion, path forward to ground troops that would be in our interests.
<QUESTION: Hi, good morning. Secretary Clinton, you've been criticized by the RNC for your demeanor last night, that you were too serious, that you didn't smile enough. Can you react to that? And also you suggested that there is a double standard. Do you think that you're treated differently in this race because you're a woman?>
<CLINTON:> Well, I'm going to let all of you ponder that last question. I think there will be a lot of Ph.D. theses and popular journalism writing on that subject for years to come. I don't take my advice and I don't take anything seriously that comes from the RNC. We were talking about serious issues last night. I know the difference between what we have to do to fix the V.A., what we have to do to take the fight to ISIS, than just making political happy talk. And I had a very short window of time in that event last night to convey the seriousness with which I would approach the issues that concern our country. Donald Trump chose to talk about his deep admiration and support for Vladimir Putin. Maybe he did it with a smile and I guess the RNC would've liked that.
<QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary.>
<CLINTON:> Like the hat.
<QUESTION: Appreciate that.>
<CLINTON:> Is this a new look?
<QUESTION: No, its kind of an old look, now.>
<CLINTON:> Oh, you're bringing it back?
<QUESTION: I'm bringing it back.>
<CLINTON:> Went shopping in your closet? 
<QUESTION: You got it.>
<CLINTON:> Yeah. I do a lot of that.
<QUESTION: Last night, Mr. Trump suggested in some of his security briefings that briefers made a suggestion or an insinuation that they were not pleased -- the CIA was not pleased with the decisions that the administration and President Obama have made so far. Did you get that same impression in the briefings that you got? And can you comment otherwise on that suggestion from Mr. Trump?>
<CLINTON:> I think what he said was totally inappropriate and undisciplined. I would never comment on any aspect of an intelligence briefing that I received.
<QUESTION: (inaudible) different standard? And what does that mean for you going into the debate?>
<CLINTON:> That's a very fair question. I -- I have been somewhat heartened by the number of articles recently pointing out the quite disparate treatment of Trump and his campaign compared to ours. I don't understand the reasons for it. I find it frustrating, but its just part of the landscape that we live in and we just keep forging ahead. Look, I -- I think this is a really important moment for everybody in our country, as you have seen by the numbers of Republicans concerned about Trump coming forward and saying, ""This is not acceptable."" They are willing to put their names out there, people who've never endorsed a Democrat, people who've never endorsed before because they are so concerned about this man and how totally unqualified he is to be president and how totally temperamentally unfit he is to be commander in chief. So I know that he says outrageous things on a, you know, pretty regular basis. And I know that's part of the coverage and I know that it may be difficult to feel that you know exactly how to respond to some of his behavior. But we're on the brink of making a very critical decision for our country. And if I were not the candidate, if I were not the nominee, if I were just a concerned citizen, I'd be out here doing everything I could to sound the alarm about someone like Donald Trump getting anywhere near the White House. And I will continue to do that.
<UNKNOWN: Thanks, guys.>
<CLINTON:> Well, you could look on the map and find Aleppo.
<QUESTION: Madam Secretary (inaudible). (LAUGHTER)>
<CLINTON:> I love you, Andrea. You are indefatigable. You're my kind of woman, I'll tell you what. Look at this. OK. I know. Go ahead. I mean the sympathy vote, the whole thing. I love it.
<QUESTION: (inaudible)>
<CLINTON:> Yes.
<QUESTION: (inaudible)>
<CLINTON:> Matt Olsen, right? Right.
<QUESTION: (inaudible) Donald Trump.>
<CLINTON:> Right, right.
<QUESTION: (inaudible)>
<CLINTON:> No, that's not true.
<QUESTION: (inaudible)>
<CLINTON:> Well, you know, look, I mean the Republicans are just in a terrible dilemma trying to support a totally unqualified nominee. I have no sympathy for them. It's their nominee. But I am not going to tolerate them continuing to make misleading, inaccurate accusations and putting out misinformation about me. And here's the latest example. Matt Olsen, the very distinguished and effective former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, was so disturbed by what he has seen coming from the Trump campaign that he wrote an article that I guess came online in the last 48 hours, pulling from public sources, very clear statements by ISIS leaders, essentially throwing whatever support they have to Donald Trump. They have, as Matt Olsen pointed out, said they hoped that Allah delivers America to Trump. They have said that they hope that he is the president because it would give even more motivation to every jihadi, someone who has insulted Muslims; has insulted a Gold Star family of an incredibly heroic Captain Khan; someone who has said he doesn't want to let Muslims around the world even come to our country. That is a gift for ISIS, and that is what Matt Olsen, who knows more about this than the Republicans trying to somehow muddy the waters, very clearly stated. That's what I mean. And look, I'm not asking for any special treatment. I -- I know the road that I'm on. I've been on it for 25 years, and I just get up every day and keep moving forward. I love this country. I will serve it with my entire heart, mind and soul. I will do everything I can to protect America. And I will do everything I can to make sure Donald Trump is not president, for many reasons, but this latest information coming from a distinguished counterterrorism expert should put every American's mind in motion to try to figure out what everyone can do to prevent Trump from being the president.
<UNKNOWN: Thanks, everybody.>

<CLINTON:> Before they cast their votes early or on November 8th. So we will continue to highlight the differences and talk about what we want to do that's going to make life better for the families of America. <CROSSTALK>
<UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right here with the cameras.>
<CLINTON:> All right. And I'm sorry guys. I'm working on a feature.
<UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you talk a lot about the middleclass, you have throughout the campaign, I'm hoping that you can help define it for me. And I'm thinking both, like, numerically, where is the -- in terms of policy, tax policy, where do you put the middleclass? And then, also philosophically, what is the middleclass to you, what does it mean?>
<CLINTON:> Well, the middleclass is the social and economic engine of our country. It is in so many ways a reflection of the success of the United States from the very beginning, to create greater economic opportunity for people willing to work for it. And it has been one of the premier historic accomplishments of our country going back decades, if not longer. And the middleclass is a hard-to-define economic target. The way I talk about it is to say, we know what the median income in America is. But if you're living in high-cost areas, if you have kids you're trying to educate and send to college, if you face healthcare costs that are beyond the average, staying in and progressing up in the middleclass takes more money in some parts of America than it does in <INAUDIBLE> so my pledge has been, that I will not raise taxes on the middleclass, and I have defined it as I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year, because in high-cost places in America, that is a -- in many ways, a cut-off that makes sense. It's something that President Obama had adhered to. It's something my husband adhered to. Because when you look at the information and across the country, I mean, housing is so much more expensive in lots of places than other places. And you understand why we've set it at that. So, the middleclass is both real and aspirational, and I want to make sure that it remains strong and it gives people a sense of security and confidence and optimism about their futures. <CROSSTALK>
<UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Madam Secretary, how worried are you about third-party candidates in general, Gary Johnson in particular? Could he be a spoiler, and would he be qualified in your view to be president at all?>
<CLINTON:> Well, look, I am just going to keep running my campaign and do everything I can to encourage people to actually get out and vote. I think either Donald Trump or I will be the President of the United States. And so, people have to look carefully in making their decision about who to vote for, because it will be either him or me, and I am going to do everything I can to make sure it's me. <CROSSTALK> 
<UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Secretary Clinton, so Donald Trump today ->
<UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've got a number of Republican endorsements, but polls show the Republican voters are still solid behind Trump - are still behind Trump solidly as Democrats are behind you. Are you disappointed you have not gotten as much Republican voters support?>
<CLINTON:> I am thrilled of the amount of Republican voter support I've gotten. I really am. And from people who understand the stakes in this election and are real thought leaders with a lot of experience, so the 50 national security professionals who came out and said they could not support Donald Trump some months ago, I think spoke volumes about his lack of fitness and qualifications for the job. Business leaders from Mike Bloomberg to Meg Whitman and so many others who understand what it will take to have a competitive economy that works for everybody, not just those at the top, they've been on the front lines. And we have an increasing number of people who actually been Republican office holders, one current one as you know, Congressman Hanna from New York, to then yesterday, senator -- former Senator Warner from Virginia, who I had the great honor of working with when he chaired the Armed Services Committee. So, I'm really honored and proud to have the level of support and the message that it sends by people who understand what the next president is going to be facing and have said Donald Trump should not be anywhere near the Oval Office. <CROSSTALK>
<UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- your flight.>
<CLINTON:> Oh, is this your first flight?
<UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is my first flight. Yes.>
<CLINTON:> Welcome aboard.
<UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you very much. Very happy to be here. I appreciate it. Secretary Clinton, the Trump campaign is signalling that they are poised to get personal about your husband's past, about your past. How will you respond at the debates and what's your response today?>
<CLINTON:> He can run his campaign however he chooses. That's up to him. I'm going to keep talking about the stakes in this election. I'm going to keep talking about my agenda that will, I believe, increase growth, make it fairer, have it be lasting, deal with the real problems that families are confronting. What I want to do to keep America safe, and to provide the kind of steady, strong leadership that the country needs, and to bring people together, which is going to be one of the highest priorities that I will have when I'm fortunate enough to be elected president, if that's what turns out. So, you know, I'm not going to comment on how he runs his campaign. You'll be able to see, we have two more debates, what he says and what I say. <CROSSTALK>
<UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Actually, I wanted to ask you a few follow- up questions. (INAUDIBLE) go to Florida very late tonight, tomorrow, do you think that Donald Trump Cuba story resonates in particular in Florida? And you're not a huge fan of continuing the embargo, so like, who cares or he would have been (INAUDIBLE)>
<CLINTON:> Well, you know, look, we have laws in our country and the efforts that Trump was making to get into the Cuban markets with his business interests ahead of the laws of the United States, and the requirements that his businesses were operating under because of the sanction, shows that he put his personal and business interests ahead of the laws and the values and the policies of the United States of America. Now, I was a strong supporter of moving toward creating an opening with Cuba, when I was Secretary of State. I applauded President Obama's efforts, and I will continue those when I am president. But, Donald Trump knew what the law was and from everything we can tell by those investigative reporting that has been done, he deliberately wanted it. And why should it be surprising that somebody who is happy to give his tax returns to state agencies deciding whether he gets to have a casino but not with the American people? And, in fact, says it's smart not to pay taxes, while he at the same time criticizes and denigrates the United States of America. So, I think it's important for voters to see that this is someone who always puts himself first. And even in the Cuban-American community, there has been a change of opinion about what's the best way to bring freedom and democracy and human rights to Cuba, but there was also a very clear understanding of what our laws were and who they covered, which was clear, and unfortunately, it looks like he didn't pay attention to them, but why should we be surprised? <CROSSTALK>
<UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Secretary Clinton?>
<UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you have your hand up?>
<UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You simply want more women to run for and win office and high office, fill in the obligation when Trump brings up your husband's past to speak out against spouses indiscretions or past being brought into a campaign like this?>
<CLINTON:> No.
<UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Secretary Clinton?>
<UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One more right here.>
<UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donald Trump today invoked your husband's impeachment as evidence that he says the Clintons are, quote, ""distorted the past"" and his presidency would be, quote, ""be bright and very clean future."" Wondering if you have any response to that comparison?>
<CLINTON:> No. Look, he can say whatever he wants to say, as we well know, we have seen it in real-time over the last many months, and I'm going to keep running my campaign talking about what I think the American people are interested in, talking about how we're going to make a difference in their lives. I love the event. I had with Senator Sanders yesterday in New Hampshire. I loved my college calculator. I hope you all will write about it again because that's what I think people are looking for. It's how can we get our government working for you. How can we help you deal with the everyday challenges you face, and you know, this amazing college calculator that our team put together will really provide good information. And I want you to understand that is in line with what I want to do more of in the government. We need to use technology more. We need to get information out. We need to have, you know, people be able to access easily information about government programs, or costs, or whatever it is that's on their minds. So, you know, that's what I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be talking about how we make college tuition free for under $125,000 per family and debt-free for everybody else. I think that -- I think that's what people care about.
<UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who's your favorite world leader?>
<CLINTON:> Oh! Let me think! Look, I like a lot of the world leaders. One of my favorites is Angela Merkel, because I think she's been an extraordinary strong leader during difficult times in Europe, which has obvious implications for the rest of the world. Particularly our country. You know, her leadership and steadiness on the Euro crisis and her bravery in the face of the refugee crisis is something that I am impressed by, I've known her for a long time, she and I have known each other back in the 1990s, I spent a lot of time with her, and I hope I have the opportunity to work with her in the future, but we can talk about lots of different leaders if you want to.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-31"">
<CLINTON:> Wow, thank you so much! And hello, Kent State! <APPLAUSE> And happy Halloween, everybody. It is great to be back in Ohio, even if the World Series is making life very stressful for Cubs fans everywhere. <LAUGHTER> I want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction and for his service to our nation. I think every American should hear his story over the next eight days before they vote. I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program. In particular, let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown, such a great senator. <APPLAUSE> My dear friend and great congressman, Tim Ryan. <APPLAUSE> State Representative John Boccieri. <APPLAUSE> State Representative Kathleen Clyde. <APPLAUSE> And let me thank Kent Clark, the acapella group that sang during the pre-program. <APPLAUSE> My friends, we are about to enter the final week of this election, so I wanted to come back to Ohio, one of the most competitive and consequential battleground states in the country, to talk about what's at stake in this election. But let me start with this. I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new e-mail story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. <BOOING> That's a good question. And first of all, for those of you who are concerned about my using personal e-mail, I understand. And as I've said, I'm not making excuses. I've said it was a mistake and I regret it. And now they apparently want to look at e-mails of one of my staffers. And by all means, they should look at them. And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my e-mails for the last year. There is no case here. <APPLAUSE> And they said it wasn't even a close call. And I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this. Now what people are focused on is choosing the next president and commander in chief of the United States of America. <APPLAUSE> And did any of you see the debates? <APPLAUSE> Well, I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country. And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said. I am running against a man who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, then why are we making them? And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Imagine, imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East. And if you're telling yourself he'll surround himself with smart people who will stop these crazy ideas, remember this. When he was asked who he consults on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because, and I quote, I have a very good brain. <LAUGHTER> He says he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. No, he does not. <LAUGHTER> And, of course, the people Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin and Putin's allies. So in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future. <APPLAUSE> I started saying last June, I believe, that Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander in chief. <APPLAUSE> And I've got to tell you, I did not take any pleasure in saying that. I have known, I have known for years now, people who ran for president, Republicans and Democrats, and I have my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats, but I never doubted their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. That's as serious as it gets. So today I want to talk about national security because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all of these weighty decisions, and that should really convince anyone how high the stakes are in this election. I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next president: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life-and-death decisions about war and peace? How do you handle a crisis? And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? <APPLAUSE> We'll start with nuclear weapons. Now, I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fearmongering, but I don't think so, and in part because of what you just heard from Bruce Blair. When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should, and I quote, ""not have his finger on the button,"" then this is a topic that can't be avoided. And as I've said, Donald has repeatedly suggested more countries should have nuclear weapons. He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world, the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it, or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that can't be stopped. And when a few more countries go nuclear, their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well. One of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. And I am proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program. <APPLAUSE> But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump. Good luck, enjoy yourselves, folks, was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people. These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. To talk so casually, so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling. President Ronald Reagan once said, and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union, and he once said he feared, and this is a quote from President Reagan, ""some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us."" That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the atomic age. So what would he think about Donald Trump who says he wants to be, and quote, ""unpredictable"" about using the most powerful weapons ever produced? And here's the thing with nuclear weapons. As Bruce told you, when the president gives the order, that's it. There's no veto for Congress, no veto by the Joint Chiefs. The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire, and that can take as little as four minutes. That's why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal. And when you heard from Bruce Blair, his story is worth remembering. In 1973, Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana. His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the president ever gave the order. Then one night in October, as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East, the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war. Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world, Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty. They unlocked the safe, they took out the launch codes and the keys and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them. Then they waited for the final order from the president. Thankfully, it never came. But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump, he sees his hair-trigger temper and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night. As I've said many times, a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. <APPLAUSE> And that brings me to the second question I think voters should ask about both candidates: How do you handle a crisis? We've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation, when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, when he's challenged in a debate, when he sees a protester at a rally, when he's confronted with his own words, so imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. Imagine his advisers afraid to tell him what he doesn't want to hear, racing against his legendarily short attention span... <LAUGHTER> ... to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet. <APPLAUSE> And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. Now, thankfully, he's never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country, but there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself. Donald is a New Yorker and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruz's attacks in a debate. And he invoked the days after 9/11 when New Yorkers really came together to take care of each other. I couldn't agree more. That's why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9/11. After the world watched with horror as the twin towers fell, he called in to a New York TV station, and even on that horrible day when thousands of people lost their lives he couldn't stop himself from pointing out that now, because the towers had fallen, a building he owned was the tallest in lower Manhattan. What kind of person brags at a moment like that? I'll tell you, someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as commander in chief. <APPLAUSE> You know, for me, I take this very personally, my friends, because I was one of New York's senators, along with Chuck Schumer, on 9/11. He and I were on the ground the very next day meeting with the governor, the mayor, emergency officials. And I will never forget the site of ground zero. The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see. Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers. They had all lost friends. In a makeshift command center, we were briefed on the damage. And it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York, but to keep America safe. That's what I did for eight years as a senator. I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed. <APPLAUSE> And I think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that, because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted, they happen. I'll tell you a quick story. It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state, but before the inauguration, and I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room. And the new Obama national security team was on one side of the table and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side. And the Bush administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration. So even before we were sworn-in to do our jobs, we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision. It really matters what your experience has been, what your values are, whether you can be counted on to make that decision. You learn a lot about people in moments like that. And as I sat there with the pressure on, having to think through in my own head how we evaluated this intelligence, how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African-American president on the Mall in Washington... <APPLAUSE> ... we made the decision to go forward. Obviously, some of you might have been there. But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there. So you have to ask yourself, in a crisis, who would you trust? Who will listen to good advice, keep a level head and make the right call? Because that's the person you want as our president and commander in chief. <APPLAUSE> Now, let's get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us. Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? Now, this may seem like an easy question. If you got it on an exam, I think you'd be able to answer it. <LAUGHTER> But apparently, it's hard for Donald. He has picked fights with our friends. I mean, the president of Mexico, the British prime minister, the German chancellor, pretty much the entire nation of Japan. <LAUGHTER> And he even picked a fight with the Pope. <LAUGHTER> And at the same time, he is praising tyrants and dictators, like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong-un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership. He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tienanmen Square. <BOOING> Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia. He's called NATO, quote, ""obsolete."" Obsolete? NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. And it's based on something... <APPLAUSE> It's based on something called Article Five which says an attack on one is an attack on all. And Article Five has only been invoked one time when our allies came to our defense after 9/11. We still have NATO allies fighting side-by-side, working side-by-side with American troops in Afghanistan. They joined us in going after al- Qaida and bin Laden. Now, we're supposed to tell them we won't have their back? And by the way, right now our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe. They're hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere. And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops, they share the risks and burdens. Now they're moving into the Baltic states to deter Russian aggression. Treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City, hanging them out dry, would make our country and our world less safe. <APPLAUSE> And it would also play right into the hands of Russia and China which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken and fail. But maybe that's the point, because what's most striking about all of this, and I would argue most important for voters to consider, is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. As former secretary Madeline Albright put it, and I quote here, ""We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States."" Michael Morell, who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here, has said that Putin is manipulating Donald. Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB. He knows he can use flattery to get into Donald's head to make Donald the Kremlin's puppet. And it seems to be working. Donald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants, from Ukraine to Syria and beyond. He's even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama . <BOOING> And it gets worse. The U.S. intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government, which means Putin, is directing cyberattacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election. So ask yourself, why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected president? Could it be because of all the nice things Donald has said about him or the fact that he has promised to adopt pro- Kremlin policies? Or maybe because of the extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin? Now, since Donald won't release his tax returns, and don't hold your breath... <LAUGHTER> ... we don't know the full extent of his business relationships, but what we know is disturbing. And we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country, a foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election. That should scare everyone, Democrat, Republican and independent. And with the election just eight days away, this can't wait any longer. Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates. <APPLAUSE> The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election. Because when you step back and take it all in, it's no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying they will not vote for Donald Trump because he would be, in their words, the most reckless president in American history. And it's no surprise that not a single former president, secretary of state or national security adviser from either party has endorsed him. <APPLAUSE> And it's no surprise that Bob Gates, Bob Gates who served eight presidents over 50 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, has said Trump is, and I quote, ""beyond repair, stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform, unqualified and unfit to be commander in chief,"" unquote. <APPLAUSE> So I hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead and how we want to secure the safety of our country, our children and our grandchildren and who's best prepared to do that, because, make no mistake, that really is what's on the ballot this year. It's not just my name and Donald Trump's name, it's our future, our security, our values. It's who we are as a country. Donald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. But the good news is there's another vision for America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unifying. <APPLAUSE> And it is big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not tearing each other down. <APPLAUSE> It is a vision that says, as I believe in my heart, a vision that says we are stronger together. Millions of people across our country are standing up and saying we believe in America that is great because it is good. That's Democrats, Republicans, independents, because we believe in an America where women are respected... <APPLAUSE> ... an America where veterans are honored, parents are supported, workers are paid fairly... <APPLAUSE> ... an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong... <APPLAUSE> ... an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, where the American dream is big enough for everyone. This goes way beyond politics and partisanship. We're really talking about what it means to be an American in the 21st century, about the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls, our kids and grandkids. It turns out if you dig deep enough through all the mud of politics, eventually you hit something hard and true, a foundation of fundamental values that unite us as Americans... <APPLAUSE> ... basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency. That is something to defend and build on. And in the end, that is what this election is all about. And here in Ohio, you can make the difference. Early voting has already begun, so now is the time. <APPLAUSE> Every phone call you make, every door you knock on moves us forward. You can go to HillaryClinton.com and volunteer. You can text ""JOIN"" to 47246 to do the same. You know, sometimes if you've studied history, you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time. This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States. <APPLAUSE> And it truly is in your hands, as it should be. So when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I hope you'll be able to say I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America, a place where our future will be created and charted by people who have confidence that the best days of America are still ahead of us, particularly young people, who I believe absolutely should help make that future. <APPLAUSE> So let's come together, let us make clear that we're going to stand up for an America that we believe in because that America believes in us. And we're going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate! Thank you!","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-31"">
<CLINTON:> Thank you. 
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> Thank you so much. Wow. It is great to be back in Cincinnati. <APPLAUSE> What a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river. I am grateful to all of you. I am thrilled to be here with my dear friends Mark and Gabby, and with all of you. Because, there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes. <APPLAUSE> Are you ready to work hard in this election and win it? <APPLAUSE> Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate? <APPLAUSE> You know, I've known Ted a long time. He is a champion for workers and families. He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages. And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done, breaking through the gridlock in Washington. <APPLAUSE> And this is important, unlike his opponent, Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE> I also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials, including my friend, the secretary of State, Alison Lundergan Grimes, from across the river, in Kentucky. <APPLAUSE> And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today. I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work. To do everything they can to help save lives in America. <APPLAUSE> You know, as Gabby says, everyday when she goes out, fight, fight, fight. And fight she does. She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries. And we do it together, to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children, our fellow men and women, our country. <APPLAUSE> And, Gabby and Mark know something very important. There is a big majority of Americans -- including a majority of gun owners -- to stand behind and achieve common sense gun safety measures. And... <APPLAUSE> ... I am looking forward to working with them as their partner. You know, you go through life, you go through the campaigns. There's ups and there're downs. And you know, my mother, who had a really difficult life. She told me something that has stayed with me, and certainly has come in handy in this campaign. Everybody gets knocked down, what matters is whether you get back up. <APPLAUSE> And throughout this campaign, I have stayed focused on one thing, you. Your lives, your families, the problems that keep you up at night. Because that's really what this election is all about. It's not about the noise and the distractions. It's about what kind of country we want for our kids. And what kind of president can help get us there. I -- I -- you know, I -- I have so much that I want to do with you, on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America. And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends on what happens in this election. <APPLAUSE> Now, earlier -- earlier today -- earlier today I was up at Kent State -- a great university -- and I told them about some of the reasons why I think it's really important to get everybody out to vote in this election. But I started by saying, you know, there's this new e-mail story about, you know, why in the world the FBI... <BOOING> ... would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrong doing, with just days to go. That's a really good question. But I want you to know, look, I've said repeatedly. On -- I -- you know, I made a mistake. I'm not making any excuses. But I will tell you this, if they want to look at some more e-mails of one of my staffers, by all means, go ahead, look at them. And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my e-mails last year. Right? <APPLAUSE> It wasn't even a close call, and I think most people have moved on. They're looking and focused on, OK. Who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief? <APPLAUSE> Did any of you see -- did any of you see the debates? Any of you see the debates?
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> I -- I got a little bit of a chance. You know, I did stand there for four-and-a-half hours with Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job. <APPLAUSE> But -- but I did occasionally get the chance to, you know, ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service, my plans for our country, what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do. And then weigh that against my opponent, what he's done and said. I -- I am running against someone who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, then why are we making them? He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. He's mentioned Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Now if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas remember this. When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult. Because, and I quote, ""I have a very good brain."" <LAUGHTER> He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. <BOOING> No Donald, you don't. And of course, the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men who's activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin and their allies. So in these last days, lets not get distracted from the real choice in this election. Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief. <APPLAUSE> I have to tell you, that -- it does not give me any pleasure saying that. It's not a small thing. I -- I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president, both Republicans and Democrats. And look I've had my disagreements with Republicans, I might have disagreed on policies or principles. But I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office. Donald Trump is different. And that's why there is so much at stake in this election. He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand. And that was over the greatest of challenges, the challenge posed by slavery. And we fought a Civil War. But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today. The kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together. I will tell you this. I want to bring, not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents. People who will vote for me and people who vote against me together. <APPLAUSE> Because I have a very different vision of America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive. It's big hearted, not small minded. <APPLAUSE> It is about lifting people up, not putting them down. It's a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart. We are stronger together. And... <APPLAUSE> ... America is great because America is good, never forget that. Yes, we have our flaws, of course, we're only humans. But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom, is unlike any other place in the history of the world. So, we want an America where women are respected... <APPLAUSE> ... where our veterans are honored... <APPLAUSE> ... where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly. And we believe in an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong... <APPLAUSE> ... an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, and the American dream is big enough for everybody. So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher. When I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck. It was a very big crowd and it was primarily students. And you know, I thought to myself, well I'm not going to give a rah-rah speech, because I really want to talk about what this means to national security. And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys, a launch officer. And, he came out for me along with more than 30 launch officers and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys. <APPLAUSE> And, even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother him. Good luck, enjoy yourselves folks, is what he had to stay about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he even knows that a single -- a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people. You know, that is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step in saying that Donald Trump should and I quote, ""Not have his finger on the button."" And when it comes to handling a crisis, we've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he's challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protester at a rally, when he's confronted by his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. <BOOING> Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. I hope you'll think about that when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world. And in who's hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren. And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing, and a president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America. <APPLAUSE> You know, as Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed by guns, thousands more are injured. It's an average of 90 people a day dying. Here in Ohio, more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes. We have seen movie-goers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, club-goers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. And we've seen far too many young African-American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men. <APPLAUSE> And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others. I've had the great honor of getting to know their mothers. Who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement. But here's what I want to say, if anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do in the 2nd Amendment. People who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey wait a minute, this can't go on. We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loop hole, close the online loop hole. <APPLAUSE> And we know, here in Ohio, a majority of gun owners support these common sense steps to prevent gun violence. Because they know we can respect the 2nd Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time. And we need to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period. <APPLAUSE> And look, there is -- there is a very clear difference. Donald Trump won't stand up to the gun lobby, he's sold out to them. In fact, the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group, more than $7 million in Ohio alone. And in return, Donald Trump has promised to repeal President Obama's actions to strengthen criminal background checks. Donald says, guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol. He's even said on his very first day in office he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms. <BOOING> How can anyone think our schools will be safer with more guns? So I have stood up to the gun lobby for years -- which is why they are running all these ads against me -- and I will stand up to them as president. <APPLAUSE> I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for responsible solutions to pass common sense reforms. Because, we've got to keep guns out of the wrong hands, and help save lives. I will also get up everyday in the White House working my heart out for you. Whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people. To get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, that's how I was raised. I was raised to believe, that if you work hard -- and I believe in hard work -- you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. <APPLAUSE> And I will never, ever quit on you. When I tell you I'm going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life, I don't care what the political or other barriers are, we're going to find a way over, under, around or through until we get it done. <APPLAUSE> I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life. And I'm not stopping now. <APPLAUSE> So just remember, when our opponents go low, we go high. <APPLAUSE> We're not going to be distracted. We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters. And everything all of you can do, between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count. Now the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple, they've announced it. Their strategy is get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, and get people of color to stay home. <BOOING> It's all part of his scorched earth campaign. But actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it, and it goes against everything we stand for. So if you're as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run, the things he has said. Insulting, not just women but immigrants, Latinos, African- Americans, prisoners of war, Muslims, veterans, the military, I mean the list goes on and on. It's almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does. <APPLAUSE> So, you know the best way to stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout in history. <APPLAUSE> We need more Americans to vote, and I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote. Because we're already seeing record turnout, 23 million people have already voted in this election, and more than 1 million of them are right here in Ohio. <APPLAUSE> There is no doubt. If we vote, we win. So... <APPLAUSE> ... please if you haven't voted early, please do so. And please get your friends and your family, everybody you know to vote. Take people to vote with you. Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there. Make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun. And you can go to Iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location. Because make no mistake, whatever issue you care about -- I've only mentioned a few tonight -- but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot. Now maybe my name and my opponents name, but where we stand on these issues, what we've done in the past, what we have said we want to do in the future, that is all on the ballot. The future of our economy is at stake. Of our education system is at stake. Fighting climate change and clean renewable energy jobs are at stake. <APPLAUSE> LGBT equality is at stake. <APPLAUSE> Equal pay for women is at stake. <APPLAUSE> Actually, in the end, the American dream itself is at stake. So I want you to think about how you'll feel on November 9th. Happy? <APPLAUSE> I think that's the right answer. <APPLAUSE> But just suppose -- just suppose you go to bed early -- suppose you go to bed early. Maybe you were too busy to vote, or maybe you didn't make calls, or knocked on doors. I want you to imagine, so you get up early on the morning of the 9th, and you log on to news to find out, hey what's going on, or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio and you hear. <BOOING> I want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us. Because I prefer for us to be motivated by what we're for, not what we're against. <APPLAUSE> But I also think it's prudent to imagine what could happen if we don't do our part. And when, in the future, somebody asks you, maybe your kids or your grandkids, what did you do when everything was on the line? I want you to be able to say, I voted for a better, fairer, stronger America. <APPLAUSE> Let's go out and in these next eight days do everything we can to make it clear, we're going after the kind of future that includes everybody. We're going to build this economy. New jobs, rising rages, we're going to make college affordable, and help you pay down your student debt. We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids. So if we build that future together, we will be able to say we were part of making sure that America's best days are still ahead of us. <APPLAUSE> And we will prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you all.","The Grammar Lab"

<CLINTON:> Hello Dade City. <APPLAUSE> Wow. <APPLAUSE> I am so excited about being here, thank you all for this really warm, wonderful welcome. <APPLAUSE> And I -- I think on behalf of all of us, I wanna thank Alisha Machado for that introduction and for sharing... <APPLAUSE> Sharing her story with us. Alisha will be voting for the very first time in this election. <APPLAUSE> And I am very grateful for her support. I'm also delighted that we're joined today by your great Senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace. <APPLAUSE> I also wanna thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox <ph>, Chairman of the Greater Pasco <ph>, Chamber of Commerce Michael Ledbetter <ph>, who is the Pasco <ph> County Democratic Executive Committee Chair and his wife Beverly. <APPLAUSE> And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elkton for his pledge of allegiance and thanks to all the elected officials, here. <APPLAUSE> And I especially wanna thank all of you for not just joining us, but helping us to get out the vote in this last week. <APPLAUSE> It's almost hard to believe, isn't it? There are only seven days left in this election. <APPLAUSE> So are you ready to vote? <APPLAUSE> Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days? <APPLAUSE> I hope, too, that you are ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate. <APPLAUSE> Patrick, whose been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families, and I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE> Now, somebody asked me the other day ""why do you keep coming back to Florida?"" just look around folks. I mean... <APPLAUSE> It is - it's a beautiful place and I have lots of friends, but it's also really important in this election. Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world. <APPLAUSE> And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days, thinking about what's at stake in this election. Because honestly, I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes. <APPLAUSE> One week from today, we will be choosing or next president and commander-in-chief of the United States. <APPLAUSE> I don't - I don't think the choice could be any clearer. You know, I have spent my career fighting for children and families. I have served in the United States Senate, served on the senate armed services committee; I was in the situation room when we bought Osama Bin Laden to justice. <APPLAUSE> I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike. I am ready to serve, if you give me the great honor of being your president. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> Now, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent. And you know, maybe for you, if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons. When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how causally he talks about nuclear weapons, he said ""well then why are we making them?""
<CLINTON:> And I have to tell you, yesterday I was in Ohio and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one our officers in charge of watching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president. And what he told the crowd, it was a big crowd at Kent State University; I think every voter should hear. Basically, his name was Bruce Blair, he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal, there is no veto. And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say ""we need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons. And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump because he does not have the temperament to be our Commander in Chief and handle those responsibilities. <APPLAUSE> So, when you think about voting - early voting this week, voting next Tuesday - responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot. So is immigration. Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working... <BOOING> ...raising their families as he has suggested he will do? I don't think so. I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploited by employers... <APPLAUSE> ...by employers like Donald Trump who refuse to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less. I don't think that's right. <APPLAUSE> Now, maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him. Somebody who'll question the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prisoner of war. We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform. <APPLAUSE> Or maybe for some of you, it's what he said about a judge born in Indiana who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University. And so Trump said, ""Well, we can't trust him because his parents were born in Mexico."" <BOOING> Now, Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House called... <BOOING> Well, but wait a minute. He called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge the definition of a racist comment. <APPLAUSE> And then Trump went on to attack a gold start family whose son, Capitan Kahn, died defending our country simply because that family was Muslim. <BOOING> And then let's not forget, Trump spent years - years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced. <BOOING> Honestly, if this were something new, I - I think we'd all be asking ourselves, ""Well, what - what does he have against President Obama? Or what does he have against me?"" But this is not new. I know I'm reaching out to Republicans and Independents, as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans. <APPLAUSE> And here's what I want you tell - I want you to tell your Republican friends in 1987 Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan. He said, ""Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world."" So, this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama, literally better than anybody I guess. And when you think about it, what he said at the convention, I alone can fix it runs counter to who we are as Americans. We work together. So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president. But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to women and girls because - <APPLAUSE> You know, any of you see the debates?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<CLINTON:> You know, I stood next to Donald for four and half hours for those three debates proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States. And during those debates, you know, Donald always used to say: What have you been doing for 30 years? And I always found that kind of odd because he could Google it and find out. And so, you know, I've been a lawyer, I've been a First Lady, and I've been a Senator. And I've been Secretary of State. <APPLAUSE> I've been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer. And for my entire life, I've been a woman. And when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he's been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women. And I got to tell you, some of what we've learned - some of this stuff is very upsetting.
<AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes.>
<CLINTON:> I would frankly rather be here talking about nearly anything else. Like how we're going to create more good jobs and get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top. How we're going to make college affordable for every single family. <APPLAUSE> Because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000 you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university. <APPLAUSE> And if you're above that, it will be debt free, and we help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it. <APPLAUSE> But I can't just talk about all the good things we want to do because people are making up their minds. This is a consequential choice. So, we've got to talk about something that frankly is painful.
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> Because it matters. We can't just wish it away, and you know, a lot of his supporters don't like to hear this. I don't blame them. If I was supporting him, I wouldn't want to hear it either, to be honest. But I got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school, and I learned it in Sunday school, you know, it's not OK to insult people. It's not OK.
<AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's right.>
<CLINTON:> And look at what he does; he calls women ugly, disgusting, nasty all the time. <BOOING> He calls women pigs, rates bodies on a scale from one to ten. We just heard from Alicia, she was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant. Well, he said she put on some weight. And it made him angry, so he called her Miss Piggy, called her Miss Housekeeping because she's a beautiful Latina. <BOOING> He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise. <BOOING> Now, you know, he also said, ""This is somebody who likes to eat."" Well, I have to say, who doesn't like to eat? <APPLAUSE> I mean, really. Can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe? <APPLAUSE> But you've got to ask, why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And I'll tell you who, a bully. That's who. <APPLAUSE> And thankfully Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down. She knows that Donald Trump... <APPLAUSE> Donald Trump doesn't get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends. <APPLAUSE> But what about our girls?
<AUDIENCE: No (ph)!>
<CLINTON:> What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence, their sense of self worth? If you've got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys?
<AUDIENCE: No (ph)!>
<CLINTON:> This is not someone we - we want them looking up to.
<AUDIENCE: No (ph) we (ph) don't!>
<CLINTON:> You know, not so long ago I was the mother of a teenage girl. And you know, every day I tried to make sure she knew that she was smart and she was capable. And I'm doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Yes! Yes!>
<CLINTON:> Because let's be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite. They don't look right, they're not thin enough, they don't act right. No one will like then unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy or whatever the criticism might be, right? And I remember when Chelsea was a teenager I would wait on the second floor of the White House, in the long hall that's there, for her to come home from school. And sometimes we only had a few minutes together. But before she'd run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out kind of how were the - how was the day. You know, we'd talk about what was on her mind. And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent.
<AUDIENCE: That's right.>
<CLINTON:> Because we parents - and I know there are a lot of parents here today. We work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence. To send them out into the world believing in their own value.
<AUDIENCE: That's right.>
<CLINTON:> And it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them.
<AUDIENCE: Yes (ph).>
<CLINTON:> And we want them to be strong. We don't want them to feel bad about themselves.
<AUDIENCE: Right (ph).>
<CLINTON:> And we've got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy. Not negative, not tearing people down... <APPLAUSE> ... lifting people up. And respecting women. In fact, all of us should respect each other in our country. And... <APPLAUSE> So when <ph> I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission. I want them to know they're loved, they're cared for, they're respected. I want them to develop a good work ethic. I believe in hard work. And I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world. But that's what I want for every child. 
<AUDIENCE: Right (ph).>
<CLINTON:> I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families. It will be the mission of my presidency, I will get up everyday in the White House trying to figure out how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges, so that people living here in Pasco (ph) County can get ahead and stay ahead. (APPLAUSE) So I know there's work to be done, we can't do it with just words alone. We've gotta do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified and oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women I'm not gonna repeat it. But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about, grabbing women, mistreating women. And I have to tell you since that tape came out, 12 women have come forward to say what he said on that tape is what he did to me. And then, we heard his response. What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting him. He said he -- he couldn't possibly have said those things because the women weren't attractive enough to assault.
<AUDIENCE BOOS>
<CLINTON:> Look at her, he said about one woman, I don't think so. About another, he said she wouldn't be my first choice. He's also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at his beauty pageants and he would barge in on women while they were getting dressed. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<CLINTON:> He said he did that -- he said he did that to inspect them, that was his word. And he said, I sort of got away with things like that and sure enough, contestants have come forward to say yes, that's exactly what he did to us. Now, as bad as that is, he didn't just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant. He's also been accused of doing this at the Miss Teen USA pageant. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<CLINTON:> Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing. Some of them were just 15 years old. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<CLINTON:> We cannot hide from this. We've got to be willing to face it, this man wants to be president of the United States of America and... <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<CLINTON:> ...our wonderful First Lady Michelle Obama spoke for many of us... <APPLAUSE> When she said Donald Trump's words had shaken her to her core. For a lot of women, who've gone through something like this in your lives, that's brought back painful memories. And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it's been shocking to see this. He tried to explain it away as locker room talk. Well, I'll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, not in our locker rooms. That does not happen. <APPLAUSE> But I guess the bottom line is, he things belittling women makes him a bigger man. And I don't think there's a women anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like. He doesn't see us as full human beings, with our own dreams, our own purposes, our own capabilities. And he has shown that clearly throughout this campaign. Well, he is very wrong. He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country. He has shown us who he is. Let us, on Tuesday, show him who we are. <APPLAUSE> We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and our grandchildren what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said. He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table he gets angry. <BOOING> Instead of supporting women who're out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder. Well, I have a message for him. We're gonna fight for affordable child care. <APPLAUSE> We are gonna fight for equal pay for all people. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna fight for paid family leave. We're gonna fight to make sure everybody gets rising wages in America. And that's important because so many people are still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid. And that's especially true for minimum wage workers who two thirds of whom are women. So, we've got work to do my friends. I'm excited because I know we can do this. And I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be because instead of Donald Trump's dangerous and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful, and unifying. <APPLAUSE> But I can't do any of this without your help. Early voting has already begun. Almost 26 million Americans have already voted. And that includes four million right here in Florida. <APPLAUSE> Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together and voting on all the issues that they care about. It may be my name and Donald's name on the ballot, but everything you care about - our security, our economy, bringing our country together, the environment... <APPLAUSE> ...clean water and clear air. Here in Dade City you can vote everyday from now until November 5th from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. In fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center - just a few minutes' drive away - you can go there right after this rally and vote because we need everybody to stand up in this election. If you've got a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today. Don't wait to send it back. Talk to your friends and family, and your neighbors, your coworkers. And you know Donald Trump's strategy's pretty simple. He says he wants to suppress young people from voting, women from voting, people of color from voting. I mean that's a lot of people. By showing up with the biggest turnout ever, we will send him and everybody a message that that's not who we are. <APPLAUSE> Now, I know here in this - this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump, and here's what I want to ask you. I want you to talk with them, ask them what they care about, ask them what kind of future they want for our country. Because Donald Trump's economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. I have said I want the wealthy to pay their fair share, and I will not raise taxes anybody making less than $250,000 a year. <APPLAUSE> So there could not be, no matter what you cared about, a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump. And I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days. We are signing people up for volunteer shifts, making calls, knocking on doors. It really matters, turnout matters. Please go to HillaryClinton.com to see how you can get involved. And here's what -- here's what I want to leave you with, you know, I feel like so many of you -- that our country is great, but we can make it greater. And the main reason America is great, is because American is good. We are a big hearted, generous people; not a small kinded people. We know that if everybody works together, we will get further together, than if we separate people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity we've heard too much about in this campaign. But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lies in the balance. And, for America, this is one of these make or break elections, it really is in your hands. And I hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November the 9th. Are we going forward together, or are we going to be pulled backwards by someone who wants to bully us? <APPLAUSE> And I hope, I hope you will think about how together, we can make a difference. I want to be your partner, as well as your president. I want us to create the best possible future for our children and out grandchildren. That is what I will work my heart out to do, and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America, where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you all.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-01"">
<CLINTON:> Wow! <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> Thank you so much! <APPLAUSE> And thank you for being out here on this beautiful night. It is great to be back with all of you. On Sunday, I had the great privilege of speaking to the congregation at New Mount Olive Baptist Church. <APPLAUSE> And I couldn't leave town without stopping at Betty's for some soul food. <APPLAUSE> And it's wonderful to be here with so many of my friends and people I admire. I want to thank Congressman Alcee Hastings who just really came out here and revved everybody up. <APPLAUSE> I want to thank the one, the only, Congressman John Lewis, an icon in the civil rights movement. <APPLAUSE> My friend, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz... <APPLAUSE> Congressman Ted Deutch. <APPLAUSE> And I have to tell you, I am really excited and very hopeful that you will send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! <APPLAUSE> So let me thank all the elected officials who are here, because this is a big deal. There are only now seven days left in the most important election of our lifetimes. We cannot take anything, anybody, anywhere for granted. Are you ready to work hard and win this election? <APPLAUSE> Well, that is exactly the right answer because we need to do everything we possibly can between now and the time the polls close one week from tonight, because any issue you care about -- anything -- is at stake. I get sometimes a little overwhelmed of the fact that I love this country and I think we are great. <APPLAUSE> And I think <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> We're not going backwards, we're going forward! <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> focus on what's important. Don't get distracted, don't get diverted. Focus on <inaudible> create. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> let's stay focused on one thing, on you, on your lives, your families, the problems that keep you up at night. And that's what I'm doing now because I know the day after the election that's what really counts. <APPLAUSE> Ask yourself, what kind of president and commander in chief do we need to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top? <APPLAUSE> Who can keep us safe and lead the world with intelligence and steadiness and strength? <APPLAUSE> Who can begin to heal the divides that have been exacerbated between us and bring Americans together again? Well, I'll tell you what, Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president of the United States. <APPLAUSE> You know, I don't say that about everybody. I have known a lot of the people who ran for president on both sides, Republicans and Democrats. I disagreed with them, don't get me wrong, but I never thought they were unfit to serve. Donald Trump is different. He has proven himself unfit. And what he is doing with his conspiracy theories, with his insulting, with his demeaning and degrading millions of Americans proves he should not be allowed anywhere near the White House. <APPLAUSE> So on the one hand, you've got to feel kind of sorry about the kind of campaign he's running, don't you? I mean, he starts by insulting immigrants, he moves on to insult all Latinos, he insults African Americans, he insults Muslims, he insults people with disabilities, he insults POWs, he then insults women <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> By the time you add up all the people he's insulted, that's more than half the population of the United States. <APPLAUSE> But here's the good news. The good news is there is another vision for America that's on the ballot. <APPLAUSE> Instead of dark and divisive, it is hopeful and inclusive. It's big-hearted, not small-minded. It's about lifting people up, not tearing each other down. <APPLAUSE> It is a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together, there is nothing we can't do <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> And we believe in an America that is great because it is good. We believe in an America where women are respected... <APPLAUSE> ... where veterans are honored... <APPLAUSE> ... where parents are supported, where workers are paid fairly. And we believe in an America of second chances, where people who have served their debt to society get a real chance to rebuild their lives... <APPLAUSE> ... so we can end the school-to-prison pipeline and build a cradle-to-college pipeline instead. <APPLAUSE> And we believe in an America that will lead the world in the fight against climate change... <APPLAUSE> ... and create millions of clean-energy jobs. We believe in an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong. <APPLAUSE> And we believe in an America that believes in the world and lives up to our values, an America where women finally get equal pay for the work they do. <APPLAUSE> We believe in an America where we will raise the national minimum wage so no one working full time will still be in poverty. <APPLAUSE> We believe in an America where we will defeat terrorists because we will work with our allies in order to put together the coalition that can do that. <APPLAUSE> We believe in an America where we know the difference between our allies and our adversaries. <APPLAUSE> And we believe in an America where we're finally do something about the violence of gun epidemics that kill 33,000 people a year. <APPLAUSE> We believe in an America where every young person can afford to go to college and not go into debt. <APPLAUSE> We believe in an America where we're going to help people who already have student debt pay it back faster, more cheaply <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> We believe in an America where we're going to provide quality, affordable health care to every person, and that includes bringing down the cost of prescription drugs and guaranteeing the security <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> Social Security is a solemn promise. We'll not privatize it, we will not turn it over to Wall Street like my opponent wants to do. <APPLAUSE> We believe in an America where people making less than $250,000 should not have an increase in their federal income taxes, but the wealthy should pay their fair share. <APPLAUSE> And we believe in an America where we grow the economy from the middle up and the bottom up, not the discredited trickle-down economics that Donald Trump has been advocating for. And, you know, by the way, we believe in an America where if somebody claims he's worth $10 billion he ought to pay some federal income tax. <APPLAUSE> Did any of you see the debates?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<CLINTON:> So, you know, I spent four-and-a-half hours <inaudible> watching Donald Trump, which proves conclusively I have the stamina to do this job. <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> So one of the things I said <inaudible> I just -- when I learned him and studied him and realized <inaudible> it just sort of stunned me. Standing next to a guy who flies around in a blue jet, who flies around in a helicopter, he has his name on those, he has his name on buildings, and actually one half of the working undocumented immigrants in America pay more in federal income tax than he does. <APPLAUSE> You live in an America where we're going to finally have comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. <APPLAUSE> We believe in an America where women are treated with respect. <APPLAUSE> And as I was in Pasco County earlier today talking about what's at stake in this election, I was introduced by a former Miss Universe pageant winner, Alicia Machado, who Donald Trump has insulted and denigrated. And really, oh, if you're Miss Universe you look pretty good, right? <APPLAUSE> And Donald Trump called her Miss Piggy, insulted her heritage, called his Miss Housekeeping because she's a Latina. Well, I was proud of her. She doesn't let such a small person get her down. <APPLAUSE> But I've got to say that I listened to what he said and how he talks about women and what he has bragged about doing to women. I want all the girls in America to know you are valuable, you should feel good about yourselves <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> And I want to say to all the young boys show respect because that shows you you're a real man and you <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> So, you know, literally, I mean, this is so much fun and it's really late, but I could be here all night <inaudible> election. <APPLAUSE> But I think you already know because you've been out here and you've been willing to be here with me because we know that we've got to turn out the vote. <APPLAUSE> And what means is that every one of you who can should vote early. How many of you have already voted? <APPLAUSE> And it doesn't surprise me because four million people in Florida have already voted. <APPLAUSE> But there are millions more that we've got to get to go out and vote, which is what I hope we will do. Talk to your friends, your family members, your coworkers. It is pretty easy to vote early in Florida. There are lots of different places in this county and every other neighboring county for you to go to. And it's important to tell people who got ballots in the mail, fill them out and send them in because we need everybody to step up. And remember, there's no state where it's more important. You know what happened in 2000, right? I was with Al Gore in Miami and he can tell you better than anyone every vote counts, especially here in Broward County. <APPLAUSE> And, you know, this is not complicated. If people who support our positive, inclusive, unifying vision vote, we win. <APPLAUSE> And we will make history on November the 8th. <APPLAUSE> So if you've already voted, come work with us, make some of the calls. We're making millions of calls, knocking on thousands, hundreds of thousands of doors to encourage everybody to be sure to vote. And, you know, you can vote right near here at the African- American... <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> ... but there are dozens of other sites. And all sites in Broward County are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Every day until November the 6th. So if you don't know where you're supposed to vote, that's easy, too. You can go to IwillVote.com and that will tell you the nearest early-voting location to where you live. And I want you to also do me another favor. If you know anybody who says they're thinking of voting from Trump, I want you to stage an intervention. <APPLAUSE> And I want you to talk to this person because unless they're a billionaire who avoided paying taxes for 20 years and lost a billion dollars running casinos, they don't have anything to gain from Donald Trump. In fact, we do have so much to lose. Every single issue we care about may not be actually listed on the ballot, but make no mistake it's on there. And talk to your friend and your coworker and say, no, really, you may be angry about something, but anger is not a plan. <APPLAUSE> Don't be used, don't be exploited. Stand up for what we can do together because that's what this election ultimately comes down to. It's about our future, it's about who we are as a country. And I promise you this, if you give me the great honor of serving as your president, I will wake up every day in that White House trying to figure out what I can do <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> America's best days are still ahead of us <inaudible> dark, pessimistic vision. It's not true and it's not who we are as Americans. So at least stand up and we say no, we're rejecting that, we're not going back, we are going to move with confidence in the future forward into the kind of potential that makes it possible for every single person to live up to his or her God-given potential, then we're going to grow the future we want together and we're going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate.","The Grammar Lab"

<CLINTON:> It is great to be here. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> I -- I am very happy to be in the home of the Steelers. <APPLAUSE> And I really appreciate having my two escorts, Mel Blount and Franco Harris. <APPLAUSE> I am very grateful to have this chance to be in Pittsburgh so close to this election. Now, I know the Steelers have a big on Sunday against Baltimore. <APPLAUSE> Let's hear it for Coach Tomlin and the team. <APPLAUSE> His wonderful wife, Kiya, is here and I'm very proud to have the support of Dan Rooney and Pat Rooney and the entire Rooney family. <APPLAUSE> Dan was a great ambassador to Ireland when I was secretary of State, and wherever he goes, he's a great ambassador for Pittsburgh. So I thank Dan and I thank Jim Rooney, who was so helpful in putting this together, and everyone from the Steelers family. Now, you've just heard two terrific speeches, haven't you? <APPLAUSE> I can't tell you how excited I am to be back here in Pittsburgh with one of your own, somebody who has made it, but never forgot where he came from, someone who I really admire because of the way he's done his business. And it's an absolute honor, Mark, to have your support in this campaign. <APPLAUSE> And I'll -- I'll have more to say about my friend Katie McGinty, but boy, I hope you're gonna send her to Washington. <APPLAUSE> I also -- I want to recognize my friend and former colleague Senator Bob Casey, who is here. <APPLAUSE> Pittsburgh mayor, Bill Peduto is here. <APPLAUSE> Allegheny County executive, Rich Fitzgerald, who is here. <APPLAUSE> And -- and two great labor leaders who are also here, the president of the American Federation of Teachers Randi Weingarten is here. <APPLAUSE> And the president of the United Steel Workers, Leo Gerard, is here. <APPLAUSE> It's great to have all of these strong supporters out in these last four days. That's all that's left in what may be the most important election of our lifetimes. So are you ready to vote, Pittsburgh?
<AUDIENCE: Yes! (APPLAUSE)>
<CLINTON:> Are you ready to volunteer for these last four days, to get out to vote <ph>? <APPLAUSE> Are you ready to elect Katie McGinty to the United States Senate? <APPLAUSE> I'll tell you, I've known Katie, she's a real fighter and she will be the kind of independent voice that Pennsylvania families deserve. And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE> And now let me ask you, are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief? <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> Wow. I'll tell you...
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! >
<CLINTON:> I think this is one of the best places for a crowd event ever. <APPLAUSE> Folks -- folks here get all fired up and energized. And... <APPLAUSE> I have to ask you, did -- did any of you see the debates?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<CLINTON:> Well, I spent four and half-hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have stamina to be the next president. <APPLAUSE> But, you know, he said so many -- so many things in those debates... <LAUGHTER> ... you know, when you debate in front of, you know, 60, 70, 80 million plus people, you gotta -- you gotta have a sense of preparation, readiness, calmness, composure, and I'll tell you some of what I heard coming from my opponent, it was really hard not to go, what did you say? <APPLAUSE> You know, he kept -- he kept saying things like well, what have you done for 30 years and, well, we know what he's done for 30 years and I mean, back in the '70s, he started with discriminating against African-Americans and Latinos by refusing to rent them apartments in New York. <BOOING> He has a long history of insulting people. It did not just start in the campaign. You can go back and -- and find what he said about all kinds of folks, and one of the things I discovered in preparing for the debates which I was kind of surprised by, is that he took out a full page in 1987 to criticize President Reagan, so he is an equal opportunity insulter. <LAUGHTER> You know, but I did choose a different path from him. I've spent my career fighting for kids and families and I'm proud that I have. <APPLAUSE> I helped to start something called the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady. <APPLAUSE> It covers eight million kids and I have to tell you that traveling around Pennsylvania -- really anywhere in the country -- I meet people who have been affected by the kinds of changes that we can do that give more folks a chance to get ahead. I'm all about making sure the American dream is big enough for everybody. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to knock down the barriers that stand in the way and, you know, if you don't have your health, it's pretty hard to get ahead, right? And so, I meet families who tell me about what that meant and it makes me very grateful. And I was a senator from New York on 9/11... <APPLAUSE> ... and I spent my eight years in the Senate helping to rebuild New York, keep us safer at home, and to provide health care to our brave first responders, our firefighters, our police, our EMTs who ran toward danger. <APPLAUSE> And as your secretary of State, I traveled to 112 countries, negotiated cease-fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons... <APPLAUSE> ... stood up for human rights, and women's rights, and workers' rights, and LGBT rights around the world. <APPLAUSE> Now, I -- I really believe that if you want to get things done that'll help people you start by listening to people, bringing them together, and I know that is not very exciting, I admit. And I do feel kind of sorry for the press covering me because what are they going to say for the 100th time? She was listening to people. <LAUGHTER> I get that, but everything I've done started there and then you bring people together, you put them around the table. They don't all agree with each other, and then you work to find common ground. That's what I did in the senate and as secretary of State. I could've never gotten anything done if I hadn't worked with Republicans... <APPLAUSE> ... and others who had different points of view. And I want you to know if you elect me on Tuesday that is the kind of president I will be. Listening... <APPLAUSE> ... learning, finding common ground. <APPLAUSE> And from the very first day of this campaign, I've been putting forward my ideas about how to help you and your families get ahead and I truly believe you deserve a candidate you can vote for, not just someone to vote against. <APPLAUSE> And so, you can go to my website, Tim Kaine and I wrote a book called ""Stronger Together"" because I want you to know what the agenda is and I want you to hold me accountable. When I come back to Pittsburgh, which I hope to do on a regular basis...<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> ... I want people to say, ""Hey, you know, I saw where you wanted to do more on infrastructure. How's that going? How many new jobs do we have? What kinds of opportunities do we have with clean, renewable energy jobs? What about raising the national minimum wage?"" <APPLAUSE> Now, one way or another, America is going to have a new president on January 20th, right? And people say all the time that they want change. Well, we will get change, change is inevitable, that is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to have. <APPLAUSE> And -- and here's where I think the choice could not be clearer. Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better America? Or are we going to fear each other and the future, hunker down against each other? I don't think that will lead to anything positive. And what I hope we will do in this election and in these remaining four days, is to think about the kind of country we want, imagine what we can do together. Every time I come into Pittsburgh now, because I started driving through Pittsburgh decades ago because my dad was from Scranton and we drove through Pennsylvania every year. <APPLAUSE> We took different routes and we went to different places. And I -- with my own eyes -- have seen the ups and the downs of this great city. And now, when I drive in, what do I see? I see a positive, optimistic, confident city making progressive, moving forward. <APPLAUSE> And I don't think you do anything in life unless you kind of imagine what it will look like. And then you get to work to do it. That's how Mark has built these great companies, right here in Pittsburgh when he was a young guy and working hard for everything he had. He got a chance to start imagining and then he got a chance to start acting and producing results. Well, that's the way it works. That's the way it works with the Steelers, right? I mean people imagine what the team can be like, they plan. The coaches, they work hard. The players, like Mel and Franco, they practice, they plan. You don't just say, hey, just get out on the field, do whatever you want. <LAUGHTER> That's not the way it works, my friends. And so what I'm hoping is that we will imagine two different Americas. Just for the sake of this exercise, imagine it's Donald Trump standing in front of the Capitol. <BOOING> And we already know a lot about him. Someone who demeans women, mocks people with disabilities, insults African Americans and Latinos and demonizes immigrants and Muslims and pits people against each other instead of pulling us together. And think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone... <BOOING> ... with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him. Imagine how easily it could be that Donald Trump would feel insulted and start a real war -- not just a Twitter war -- at 3:00 in the morning. Imagine what it would mean for our economy to have someone who built his career exploiting workers, stiffing small businesses. Now, you heard earlier from Andrew Tesoro. He designed a building for Donald Trump. Trump told him he loved it, it was at one of his golf courses and then Trump would not pay the bill. Now, Andrew didn't have the resources to sue the Trump organization. So Trump just walked away from what was owed. This is someone who personally signed -- not some executive -- he personally signed a contract with a union-busting firm to keep workers at one of his hotels from being able to organize and bargain collectively.<BOOING>
<CLINTON:> And just yesterday, Donald Trump was told he was breaking the law by not negotiating with his hotel workers in Las Vegas. And we know -- and the steelworkers sure know -- he chose to build two of his buildings with Chinese steel and aluminum instead of supporting America's steel industry and American steelworkers. <BOOING> Everywhere he goes, he leaves people behind. You know, one of my goals as president is to encourage more companies to do what Mark did with profit-sharing. If any of you were with us when Mark endorsed me, Tim Kaine and I were here, in Pittsburgh and he talked about how he had shared the profits of his company, including the profits he gained when he sold his companies. I think you told me Mark, you made 300 millionaires at your first company. <APPLAUSE> Look, we've got to have a strong private sector, we need business to be creating more jobs. I really like the kind of jobs and business that Mark does, because what he is to worry about and take care the people who helped made him successful in the first place. <APPLAUSE> Now, imagine having a president who owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and other foreign entities that he doesn't tell us about. Ask yourself, so if he's sitting across the table negotiating with people from those countries, is he going to put his own financial interests ahead of America's interests? I can tell you this, when I'm sitting across the table from the Russians or anyone else, I know who I'm representing. The American people and our interests. <APPLAUSE> Now, my friends, we got some good news this morning, our economy created 161,000 jobs last month.
<CLINTON:> That is... <APPLAUSE> That is 73 straight months of job growth. <APPLAUSE> And I believe that our economy is poised to really take off and thrive, but we need to make sure the economy is working for everyone not just those at the top and that is my pledge. I believe in growth from the middle out and the bottom up. When the middle class thrives, America thrives. <APPLAUSE> Donald Trump believes something different, he wants an economy that works for him. That's why he wants to give the biggest tax breaks in history to the super wealthy and big corporations. His own family would get a $4 billion tax break, now... <BOOING> ... figure that out. We know he hasn't paid taxes, right? If it turns out that he's as rich as he claims, it would be trickle down economics on steroids. The wealthy would be paying lower tax rates than ever. His plan -- and this is what I want you to hear -- so, he's taking care of himself, he's taking care of his family, he's taking care of the super wealthy and corporations, his plan would actually raise taxes on 26 million low-income and middle class people. <BOOING> He would hit especially hard -- 51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up. <BOOING> That means that 316,000 working families in Pennsylvania would pay more under Donald's plan. Honestly, I don't know how he lives with himself. Doesn't he see -- doesn't he see what we see? The millions of moms and dads struggling to make ends meet, balance the demands of work and family? Or does he just not care? Remember, this is a man who said pregnancy is an inconvenience for an employer. <BOOING> He has said, and I quote, ""Putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing."" <BOOING> Well, I see things differently. When I say we need to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top, I mean everyone. Families are facing a lot of pressures. In many families, women are contributing to the income of their families or they are the sole -- the sole income in the family. <APPLAUSE> More people than ever are working gigs on the side just to make extra money or to make ends meet and for working families, the cost of everything is going up from childcare to prescription drugs, to college education. And I think we all know, somebody who's working two minimum wage jobs and trying to raise their families at the same time. It's hard being good workers and good parents. And we know young people who want to start a small business the way Mark did it, when he got going and maybe they want to buy a first home or they just got married and they're trying to get ahead in life, but student debt is holding them back. And I want us to know that I will do everything I can to help ease the costs of middle class and working and poor families so that more people... <APPLAUSE> ... can do better.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> And right now, so many of the people -- so many of the people who are doing the toughest, most important jobs in our country are getting paid the least. And a lot of them are women and people of color, right? Childcare workers trying to take care of our kids... <APPLAUSE> ... nurses who work the night shift and spend more time with their patients than the doctors do, the home health aides who keep our seniors independent and healthy. <APPLAUSE> There are so many jobs of value to our society where the paychecks don't reflect how important they are. So I will do everything I can to get incomes rising for hardworking people. Whether you work in steel, whether you work in a factory, whether you're a machinist, a nurse, a teacher, a firefighter, a police office, whatever you are, you deserve to be part of a growing, thriving, middle-class economy. <APPLAUSE> And so that's why -- that's why we're going to raise the national minimum wage... <APPLAUSE> ... and we're going to join every other advanced economy and make sure we've got paid family and medical leave so you can take care of the people you love. <APPLAUSE> And here it is, 2016. Don't you think it's finally time to guarantee equal pay for women? <APPLAUSE> Well, I got to tell you, this is not a woman's issue, it's a family issue. If you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, you want her to be paid equally because that goes to your family's bottom line. Now, I've gotten sort of used to the fact, that when I talk about equal pay, or paid family leave, or affordable child care, Donald Trump and his supporters say I'm playing the woman card. Well, I'll tell you what. If fighting for those kids and family issues is playing the women's card, you know what I say, deal me in. <APPLAUSE> We are going to invest in our people, especially our young people. We don't have anybody to waste or leave behind. We can't leave any talent on the sidelines. And we've got to make sure we fight against discrimination. <APPLAUSE> We've got to work in communities where factories have closed and nothing has come in to replace it, like so many places in central and western PA. And we're going to make the biggest investment in good- paying jobs since World War II. There's a lot of good work to be done in this country, and that work will put people in jobs here in America that cannot be exported. They've got to be done right here. <APPLAUSE> So, my friends, we're going to make our economy stronger for decades, we're going to make America the 21st Century clean energy superpower... <APPLAUSE> ... we're going to produce enough renewable energy to power every home. We're going to make it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs to get the credit they need to grow. And we're going to make it possible again to say and believe it that in America, if you can dream it, you can build it. <APPLAUSE> And part of that dream is making sure people get the education and the skills they need. So here's what I want to do. Starting in pre-school, I want to better prepare every kid to do well in real school. Right? <APPLAUSE> I want every kid to have good schools and good teachers in every ZIP code in America, not just some.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> I want us to bring back technical education to high school, and once again... <APPLAUSE> ... lift up those good paying, necessary jobs that don't require a four-year college degree. <APPLAUSE> I want us to do more with our community colleges and more apprenticeship programs by unions and businesses to help prepare people. <APPLAUSE> And I am tired of meeting young people that can't either start or finish college because they can't afford it. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free if you make less than $125,000 a year. <APPLAUSE> And for people who are... <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> You know I make lists all the time. <LAUGHTER> I make lists of my lists. <LAUGHTER> But I have a list about what we're going to do, and it's because it all comes down to this, I love our country and I believe in the American people. And I know there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together. <APPLAUSE> So, as you head to the polls, as you talk to your friends and neighbors who might still be deciding who to vote for, please ask them to search their heart about what kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids. <APPLAUSE> It is not as important that they think about voting for me as it is they think about voting for themselves. <APPLAUSE> Every issue we care about is on the ballot on Tuesday. And I know that if we have a big win on Tuesday, we will have a big wind behind our backs going into the government in January. <APPLAUSE> So tell everybody, please, to vote and that you can make the difference going to the polls on Tuesday, November 8th. If you don't know where to vote, go to iwillvote.com to confirm your voting location or to find out how to send in an absentee ballot. We are on track right now to having the biggest turn out in American history. <APPLAUSE> People in states where they have early voting have already set a record. We have 31 million people who've already voted. <APPLAUSE> And if you know anybody here in Pittsburgh or in western PA who's thinking about voting for Trump, please stage an intervention before it's too late. <APPLAUSE> I mean, really, just sit down with them and ask them what they care about. And if they say they're just frustrated or angry, say you understand, but anger's not a plan. <APPLAUSE> We've got work to do. We're going to roll up our sleeves and we're going to do it together.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> And if you can give us any time -- if you can give us any time to volunteer, go to hillaryclinton.com to sign up or text JOIN, J-O-I-N, at 47246 because, believe me, I don't want any of us -- not me and not you -- to wake up on Wednesday and think, ""If we'd only done a little bit more, things would have turned out differently."" Sometimes the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time. This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States. It is in your hands. <APPLAUSE> And when your kids and your grandkids ask what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you'll be able to say, ""I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America..."" <APPLAUSE> ... where we build <ph> walls. We don't build walls, we build bridges. And where we build the future that we want. And where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate."" <APPLAUSE> Thank you all. God bless you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-04"">
<CLINTON:> Thank you. I'll tell you, I am so glad to be back in Michigan. <CHEERS> And that introduction, I'm just still vibrating from it. I thank my longtime friend, Reverend Wendell Anthony, for giving us some of the best lines that we've had in the whole campaign. Thank you, Wendell. <CHEERS> You know, there's something special about this place, and some of you may have recognized the song that was playing that when I came in, an amazing anthem sung by the talented Andra Day, called ""Rise Up."" <CHEERS> And that is what Detroit is doing. You are rising up. And that is exactly what we're going to do in America. We're going to rise up and make sure the American dream is big enough for everyone. <CHEERS> I'm looking forward to working with the great team you have here in Detroit and in Michigan. I want to thank your senators, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters. <CHEERS> I want to thank your members of Congress, Congressman John Conyers, Sandy Levin, Congressman Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell. I want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Mike Duggan. Thank you. <CHEERS> Wayne County executive Warren Evans, Sheriff Bennie Napoleon, the president of the UAW, Dennis Williams. <CHEERS> Longtime friends and former colleagues of mine, former Senator Carl Levin and his wife Barbara are here. And to all who are present today, I was delighted that my friend and my supporter, Mark Cuban could be here because he's not only a real billionaire... <LAUGHTER> ... he's actually shared his profits with his employees. <CHEERS> Now are you ready to vote on Tuesday? <CHEERS> Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote? <CHEERS> Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in- chief? <CHEERS> Did any of you see the three debates that we had? Well, I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president. <CHEERS> He kept saying a lot of unusual things, didn't he? And you know, there's a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates, and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States. <CHEERS> And I did practice my composure. People said to me, well, how did you do that? The things he was saying. And then that second debate, when he was following you around and lurching over you. I said, well, I did practice. And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me. So I was ready. But he would say, well, what have you done for 30 years? And you know, I don't want to brag. <CHEERS> But I do think, I do think it matters what you've done, and especially what you've done that maybe improves somebody else's life, right? And one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what we've been doing. For example, as first lady I helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers 8 million kids. <CHEERS> And these are families that, you know, they are not poor families, they are working people, but they don't make enough money and they don't work for somebody who provides insurance. And so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the healthcare they should have had. I met a woman whose baby daughter, when she was born, was diagnosed as totally deaf. And the doctor said, you know, we're sorry, there's really nothing we can do for her. But this mother, like many mothers I know, did not take that for an answer, right? She got on the Internet, she began to research, and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter, but they were expensive and she and her husband didn't have that kind of money and they didn't have insurance. She was at her doctor's office and just so distraught, and the doctor said, well, there's this new thing called the Children's Health Insurance Program. Maybe you should look into it. Turned out she was eligible. She signed up. She started getting her daughter the best healthcare that every child in this country should be able to have, by the way. <CHEERS> And when I was in North Carolina, I heard about her and got to meet her. But more than that, I met her daughter, who talked to me and who just graduated from college, because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have. <CHEERS> I'll tell you what. That is how I judge my last 30 years. Have I done something to help somebody else? I am well aware of the blessings that I have had, and I want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward, make it possible for more families, more kids to have the chance to live up to their own God-given potential. <CHEERS> And I was a senator in New York on 9/11, so I know what can happen, the evil and the hatred of terrorism. I saw it, and I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get healthcare for the brave first responders who ran toward danger, not away from it. Our police, our firefighters, our EMTs. And I'll tell you who else we got covered. We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools, and I see one right out there, who knows exactly what I'm talking about. <CHEERS> All across the city people were leaving their jobsites and rushing toward danger. That was America at its best, and don't ever forget what we are capable of being, who we are. We are not afraid. We are brave, courageous people who will do our best if given the chance. <CHEERS> And as your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, negotiated cease-fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and workers' rights and LGBT rights. <CHEERS> I'm telling you this because I want you to know that I will do everything I can. If I am honored to be your president, I will get up every day in that White House and I will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to have the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have. <CHEERS> I want you to have a candidate you can vote for, not just someone to vote against. That's why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues, not insults. <CHEERS> Because if you really take a look at what's at stake in this election, it is a choice between two very different visions for America. I've got to say, when I hear my opponent talk about America, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. It is so dark, so divisive, so hateful. That is not the America that I believe in. I believe that we should have a confident, optimistic, inclusive vision of where we're going and how we're going to get there. <CHEERS> I love our country and I believe in the American people, and I think there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them. \ <CHEERS> See, we believe in an America that is bighearted, not small minded. We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part. <CHEERS> And we believe America is great because America is good. Never forget that. If we lift each other up and not tear each other down, we can go even further. And I believe with all my heart. That's why the slogan of my campaign sums it up, that we are stronger together. <CHEERS> And so, come next January 20th, America is going to have a new president. <CHEERS> I know that a lot of people say that they want change. Well, let me tell you this. Change is inevitable. There will be change. The question is what kind of change are we going to have. <CHEERS> Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better country? Or are we going to fear the future and each other? I sure hope not. That is not the America that I believe we are. So here's what I want to ask you to do. I want you to talk to your friends and your family, your neighbors. Michigan is one of these states that doesn't have early voting. I've been all over the country, going to states that are already voting. In fact, about 31 <million> to 32 million people have already voted in those states. But Michigan votes on Tuesday. <CHEERS> And I imagine, I imagine there are some of you who know people who say they're going to vote for Donald Trump, right? <BOOS> I know. I understand that. I mean, I would hope you'd try to stage an intervention before it's too late. <CHEERS> But maybe you can ask them with you to imagine, imagine January 20th, 2017, and imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol. <BOOS> Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled. Who insults African-Americans and Latinos and Muslims. <BOOS> Who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively. <BOOS> Now the truth is, we really don't have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done, both in his career and in this campaign, tells you what could happen. You know, Michelle Obama, who says so many wise and wonderful things... <CHEERS> She said the presidency doesn't change who you are. It reveals who you are. And I think we've seen who Donald Trump is. Maya Angelou, another great American, Maya Angelou said, when someone shows you who he is, believe him the first time. <CHEERS> And if my opponent were to win, we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself. Just last year he said again it wouldn't have mattered if we'd rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt. <BOOS> What is he talking about? I'm proud that President Obama saved the auto industry. <CHEERS> And I'm even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry just had its best year ever. <CHEERS> If Donald wins the election, we have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States. <BOOS> We are a country founded our religious freedom. That runs contrary to our Constitution. We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of the black people are all about crime and poverty and despair. <BOOS> He has no idea about the strength of the black church in the vibrancy of black-owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities. <CHEERS> He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field. <CHEERS> I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony, don't you? <CHEERS> Yesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named May Brown Wiggins. Decades ago she was a hard-working nurse in New York City. She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent, but Donald Trump and his father Fred turned her away. You see, whenever African-Americans tried to rent Trump apartments, their application was marked with a C, C for colored. <BOOS> And that didn't sit very well with May, so she went to the authorities, and eventually the Department of Justice sued the Trumps for housing discrimination. <CHEERS> And although they settled, they wouldn't change. So the government had to take them back to court. That's a pattern. This is what happens time and time again with my opponent. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the federal housing department. If he doesn't respect all Americans now, how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future? <CHEERS> He has such a casual disregard of our Constitution. He doesn't seem to understand that the rule of law, that we really are a nation of laws, not men. <CHEERS> Here's the latest example. There is a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City. It was called the Central Park five. Maybe some of you have heard of it. There were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. They were wrongfully convicted, and they were in prison, where they spent years. Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids. And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence, as someone else confessed to that terrible crime, Trump actually said they should still be in prison. <BOOS> It doesn't matter if you are innocent. If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up. <LAUGHTER, CHEERS> No wonder he admires Vladimir Putin, because that's exactly what Putin does to his people. <CHEERS> So we can't trust him with our Constitution. We can't trust him to obey the rule of law. He has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. So let me paint you a different picture. Here's what we're going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night. <CHEERS> We have three big, three big challenges. Number one, we've got to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. <CHEERS> Number two, we've got to keep our country safe and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence for peace and prosperity. <CHEERS> And number three, we've got to bring our country together. We've got to overcome these divides. We have to heal our nation. And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges. <CHEERS> I have said repeatedly that we're going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back, it can lead to holding other people back. We can't accept as normal what we're seeing across our country because of his campaign. A church in Mississippi was burned this week. Someone painted ""Vote Trump"" on the side and then set it on fire. <BOOS> We can't let that happen. What happened in Flint, Michigan, should not be normal or acceptable. <CHEERS, APPLAUSE> Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water. Those are basics. And we've got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children. And it's important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody, that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II. Infrastructure. Advanced manufacturing. Clean, renewable energy technology. <CHEERS> Some people say we can't do that. Well, I'm telling you they are wrong. They are wrong. We have the best workers, the most productive workers. We're going to give them more to work on, more products to produce. <CHEERS> And we're going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities. <CHEERS> I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America. That means we're going to dismantle the so-called school to prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle to college pipeline. <CHEERS> We're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school, with good teachers, no matter what ZIP Code that child lives in. <CHEERS> And I want to start with our youngest kids, with prekindergarten program. And then I want to be able to partner with our teachers. We've got to have high expectations and get results in helping our children. And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them. <CHEERS> It will be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other. I believe we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law, and that's what we're going to work for. <CHEERS> We're also going to take commonsense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives. <CHEERS> This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent. Have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now? Really. We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place. <CHEERS> And while we create more safe communities, we want to invest in those communities. I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic presidents have done, one named Clinton, one named Obama. <CHEERS> And I want to be a really strong partner. I'll compete a little with them, but I want to be a real strong partner with Detroit and other cities that are on the way back up, to make sure you get the investment and the support, the housing and the jobs that you need. But we also have to make sure our economy is fairer. That's why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage because people who work full-time should not be left in poverty. <CHEERS> And isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women? <CHEERS> This is not a woman's issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a daughter or a sister who works, it's your issue, it's a family issue. And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare, paid family leave, equal pay for women, the other side accuses me of playing the woman's card. I'll tell you what. If standing up for equal pay is playing the woman's card, then deal me in. <CHEERS> And one of the other, one of the other big challenges we're going to take on, I am so excited about this. You know, I'm really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues. And what we decided after it was over is how we can work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate. <CHEERS> So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university, you will go tuition free if your family makes less than $125,000 a year. <CHEERS> And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you don't go into debt. <CHEERS> For people who already have student debt, we're going to help you pay it down and pay it off, to get out from under it. <CHEERS> And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country. This is just some of what we are offering in this campaign because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election. Now I had a friend say to me the other day, you know, people are just frustrated and angry. I get that. I understand that. We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in '08 and '09. Millions of people lost their jobs. Millions lost their homes. Family wealth was wiped out. That is a trauma, and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that. I get it. But I learned a long time ago from my late mother, anger is not a plan, all right? Be angry, vent about it, and then roll up your sleeves and get to work. <CHEERS> That's what I will do. That's why we put this all down. It's on our website, HillaryClinton.com. It's in a book that Tim Kaine and I put out called ""Stronger Together,"" because not only do I want you to know what I will try to do as your president, I want you to hold me accountable. I want you... <CHEERS> I want you, when I come back to Detroit, which I will do, when I travel around Michigan, which I will do, I want you to say, well, how's it going getting those new jobs started? How much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable? I believe in making lists. Maybe it's a woman's thing. <CHEERS> My husband said to me one time, you have lists of your lists. Well, I do, because I want to know what we're going to get done and how we can make progress together. And ultimately this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids, and in my case now my grandkids. Are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all? Are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal? <CHEERS> I believe we can do this together. My opponent at his convention said ""I alone can fix it."" Well, no. Nobody alone does anything. When our founders met in Philadelphia, it wasn't one person creating our country. It was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy. And then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers rights and women's rights and LGBT rights. <CHEERS> None of them, none of them were won by one person alone. The American labor movement didn't happen to get somebody one day say, I alone make it happen. It took millions of people in every one of these movements, marching and speaking out and sitting in. Barack Obama wasn't put into the White House by one person alone. It took everybody working and organizing and, yes, voting. That is how progress happens in America. <CHEERS> So really, it all comes down to you, my friends. You have to vote. Our progress is on the line. Everything that has happened up until this point is on the line. I'm ready to defend and build on the progress that we've made. I'm proud I was a member of President Obama's cabinet. I'm proud that he and I are friends. <CHEERS> But he knows and I know that American leadership, American presidents, it's like running a relay. You do your very best and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you had it off to doesn't drop to the ground. Or doesn't turn around and run back the way we came from, which is what my opponent is promising to do. <CHEERS> Now I've told the president that when he hands off the baton, he's going to have to bend over. He's a lot taller than I am. But I'm excited about what we can do. I know this is been a tough campaign. I've got people coming up to me saying they've got migraines they never had before. They have stomachaches that they don't know what they're going to do with. I get it. It has been in many ways a really tough campaign. But I'll tell you what. Michigan, you can make the difference. <CHEERS> All I'm asking you is, talk to your friends, talk to your family, talk to your coworkers, talk to everybody. If you have time to volunteer, go to HillaryClinton.com to volunteer, or text join47246 because when your children -- and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today. <CHEERS> When your children or grandchildren ask what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I want you to be able to say, I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America. <CHEERS> An America where we build bridges, not walls. <CHEERS> And where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Let's get to work. Thank you, Detroit. Thank you, Michigan. God bless you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-05"">
<CLINTON:> Thank you! Thank you so much! <APPLAUSE> Hello, Pembroke Pines! <APPLAUSE> Hello, Florida! <APPLAUSE> I am thrilled to be here. And boy, is this a hardy group. Rain or shine, you're ready. <APPLAUSE> I love -- I just looked over here, I saw a man who's changed his sign from ""I will vote"" to ""I have voted."" <APPLAUSE> You know, I am thrilled to be here with all of you. And I want to start by thanking Sybrina Fulton for that introduction. <APPLAUSE> I have to tell you, on a very personal note, one of the privileges of this campaign over the last year-and-a-half has been getting to know Sybrina and all the mothers of the movement. They are some of the bravest people you'll ever meet. They have taken the heartbreak and the anguish of losing their children to either gun violence or encounters with the police, and they've turned it into action. The Trayvon Martin Foundation that Sybrina founded to honor her son is part of the agenda, part of her mission. I'm very grateful to her for her commitment to make America a fairer, safer, better place. Thank you, Sybrina. <APPLAUSE> Now, we've got a bunch of great folks here with me I want to have stand up. And I hope that you will send him to work with me in the Senate, Congressman Patrick Murphy. <APPLAUSE> Also with us, Congressman Ted Deutch... <APPLAUSE> ... Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz... <APPLAUSE> ... Congressman Alcee Hastings... <APPLAUSE> ... the mayor of Pembroke Pines, Frank Ortis... <APPLAUSE> ... the vice mayor of Broward County, Barbara Sharief... <APPLAUSE> ... Broward County school board member Patti Good... <APPLAUSE> ... Mayor Phil Levine all the way from Miami Beach. <APPLAUSE> And I especially want to thank my friend of so many years, I was trying to think about this as we were driving, I don't know when we first met, but we were both really, really young... <LAUGHTER> ... Randi Weingarten. <APPLAUSE> And along with thanking Randi, the president of the AFT, let me thank all the educators, all the teachers. <APPLAUSE> I think it's about time we stopped scapegoating teachers and start supporting teachers. <APPLAUSE> Now, every day in this campaign is exciting. And being here with all of you, the last Saturday before Election Day, really gets me geared up. We are seeing tremendous momentum, large numbers of people turning out, breaking records in a lot of places. Now, just in case you didn't notice last night, I've got to say I was with Jay Z and Beyonce. <APPLAUSE> They were amazing. You can go online and watch it. It was the most extraordinary show. You know, when a famous entertainer says, hey, I want to support you, help get out the vote, that is such a gift. But the thought that went into what they did last night, my personal favorite part was Beyonce had her backup singers and dancers in pantsuits. I mean... <APPLAUSE> But what was really touching to me is both of them talked about what this election means for their daughter and for all of our daughters and our sons, every single child. <APPLAUSE> So I've got to ask you, are you ready?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<CLINTON:> How many of you have already voted? <APPLAUSE> OK. So that means you've got time to get everybody else to get out and vote, right? <APPLAUSE> Now, did any of you see the debates?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<CLINTON:> I spent four-and-a-half hours standing next to Donald Trump on that stage... <BOOING> ... proving once and for all that I have the stamina to be president of the United States. <APPLAUSE> Now, you know, he kept saying things like, well, what have you done for 30 years? And I'm thinking to myself, Donald, you don't want to go there. <LAUGHTER> I mean, I would have been happy to spend all four-and-a-half hours talking about what I did compared to what he's done for the last 30 years. <APPLAUSE> As your first lady, I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program which insures 8 million kids a year. <APPLAUSE> As senator, I worked to rebuild New York City and make our country safer and get our first responders the health care they needed. <APPLAUSE> As your secretary of state, I traveled to 112 countries, I've stood up for human rights, women's rights, worker rights and LGBT rights. <APPLAUSE> I have spent my career fighting for kids and families. And if you elect me, that's what I'll keep doing. <APPLAUSE> Now, my friends, you are a hardy bunch to stand out here in the rain. I don't think I need to tell you all of the wrong things about Donald Trump. But here's what I want you to remember: I want to be the president for everybody, everybody who agrees with me, people who don't agree with me, people who vote for me, people who don't vote for me. <APPLAUSE> So let's get out, let's vote for the future. Let's vote for what we want for our country and our children and our grandchildren. God bless you!","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-06"">
<CLINTON:> I -- I am -- I am so, so touched and so grateful to be here in Manchester with all of you. <APPLAUSE> And particularly with Mr. Khan. <APPLAUSE> As -- as he was speaking, I saw several of you holding up your Constitutions. <APPLAUSE> And he reminded us all of the fundamental values that set us apart as Americans. He and his family exemplify the values that make America great. And in a race that has been marked by ugly suspicion and insults, and attacks of all kinds against immigrants, and Muslims, and so many others, Mr. Khan, I think reminded all of us that we are Americans. His son was an American who gave his life for our country. We cherish the Constitution and we will defend it. <APPLAUSE> In fact, when a president is sworn in on inauguration day, that's the oath that a new president swears to -- to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The first words I ever heard from Mr. Khan were about his son's courageous final moments serving our country in Iraq. He told the other troops in his unit to get back from a suspicious vehicle approaching their position. But he went forward. He took 10 steps toward danger before that car exploded. After his death, he was awarded both the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. And here's what Mr. Khan said... <APPLAUSE> ... that really struck a chord with me. And as the story he just told us of the mother telling him about her son being bullied, these are words that I would hope that all Americans, and particularly young Americans would hear and heed. Mr. Khan said ""We still wonder what made him take those 10 steps. Maybe that's the point where all the values, all the service to country, all the things he learned in this country kicked it. It was those values that made him take those ten steps. And those ten steps"", Mr. Khan went on to say, ""told us"" -- meaning he and his wife and his family -- ""told us we did not make a mistake in moving to this country."" <APPLAUSE> In fact, I think we should all be grateful that this remarkable family decided to make America their home. We should be grateful for everyone who looks at America and sees a beacon of hope worth defending. <APPLAUSE> This means so much -- this means so much to me, because like all of you, I love our country. <APPLAUSE> And I believe with all my heart that our best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together. I also believe, as Mr. Khan and were talking before we came on, that we will have some work to do to bring about healing and reconciliation after this election. We have to begin listening to one another and respecting one another. <APPLAUSE> Because our core values are being tested in this election. But when I meet people -- when I have a chance to hear from them about what they want for themselves and their families, my faith in our future has never been stronger. This election is a moment of reckoning. It is a choice between division or unity; between strong, steady leadership, or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk. <APPLAUSE> And so, my friends, this is one of these elections that really is a crossroads election in our country. I'm grateful to be joined tonight by so many wonderful people. There's a big overflow -- there are several overflows and I hope they can all hear my voice. <APPLAUSE> I want to thank James Taylor for that wonderful performance. <APPLAUSE> So many of his songs are a part of the soundtrack for American and it's wonderful that he could be here with us, along with his wife, Kim. <APPLAUSE> I'm thrilled to be with your next Senator, Maggie Hassan. <APPLAUSE> Maggie will bring a wealth of experience to Washington. She will bring the skills that enabled her to work across the aisle in the legislature and with the legislature. And we need that kind of common sense, problem-solving approach -- that independent voice that New Hampshire so deserves to have. So I hope and trust you will send Maggie to the Senate on Tuesday. <APPLAUSE> And I hope you will send Colin Van Ostern to the governorship. <APPLAUSE> Colin will build on Maggie's record of accomplishment. And I think about all of the jobs that have been created in this state, how college has been made more affordable, how you've taken on the epidemic of addiction. You're doing it the New Hampshire way and both Maggie and Colin represent that. <APPLAUSE> I sure think Washington needs more of that. And I want you, also, to know how important it is to send Congresswoman Annie Kuster and Congresswoman Carol Shae-Porter to Washington, as well. <APPLAUSE> Both Annie and Carol will bring the same attitude about rolling up their sleeves and getting to work for you that we really need in the Congress right now. And another great member of the Senate who's been up here campaigning for Maggie and talking about what will make the Senate work better is the senator from Rhode Island, Sheldon Whitehouse, who's here with us. <APPLAUSE> And finally -- finally, I want to just recognize a New Hampshire native, who is now the Attorney General of Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Heeley. <APPLAUSE> Now, elections are, of course, a choice -- a choice between the people who are running. But much more than that, they are a choice about what we want to do in our country -- what kind of country we want. And they are often premised the visions -- the views of the candidates. And what I've tried to do in this campaign is to lay out an agenda -- what a novel idea. <LAUGHTER> I actually... <APPLAUSE> I actually want you to know what I will try do if I'm so honored as to become your president. <APPLAUSE> And my -- my running-mate, Tim Kaine, and I got together and we -- we put out a book called ""Stronger Together"" which has all of our policies in there. It's -- yes, I see somebody holding it up back there -- because we don't only want you to know what we plan to do; we want you to hold us accountable. When I come back to New Hampshire, I want you to ask, how's that college affordability plan going? What are we doing about getting the cost of prescription down? How are we managing the economy so that it produces more good jobs for everybody, not just those at the top? I want -- I want us to have an ongoing discussion about how we are all going to contribute to making our country all it should be. I really believe that America's best years are still ahead of us if we all do our part. <APPLAUSE> And I -- I think it's fair to say, after all the months of this campaign, my opponent has a very dark and divisive view of our country. Sometimes when I hear him speak, I honestly don't recognize the country that he is talking about. Sometimes I'm not sure he recognizes the country he's talking about. <APPLAUSE> Did any of you see the debates? Did you all see the debates? <APPLAUSE> Well, I did spend four-and-a-half hours next to Donald Trump in those debates, proving, conclusively, I have the stamina to do this <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> But...
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> But it's also... <APPLAUSE> But I -- I think it's -- it's -- it's also important that we believe in a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted, united America, right? <APPLAUSE> Where everyone has a place; where everyone is included; where people who are willing to work hard can get ahead and stay ahead; where we recognize the importance of the American dream and we believe, and we will ensure, it is big enough for everyone, not just a few. <APPLAUSE> So I -- I really believe that, although my name and my opponent's name may be on the ballot come Tuesday, what's really on the ballot is what kind of country we want for our children and our grandchildren. <APPLAUSE> What's really on the ballot is every single issue we care about. Our Constitution set up a system of government that has stood the test of time. It can sometimes be frustrating, provide challenges -- we know that. But here we are, the longest-lasting democracy in the history of the world. That is to be cherished and nurtured; not demeaned, not degraded. <APPLAUSE> Now, if you believe that our brave men and women in uniform, like Captain Khan, deserve a commander-in-chief who knows what needs to be done, then you have to vote. Don't leave it to chance. Don't leave it to others. Use your voice and your vote because my opponent actually said more countries should have nuclear weapons. <BOOING> And when a journalist asked him about using nuclear weapons, he said ""Well, why do we make them?"" I wonder if he even realizes he's talking about nuclear war. The other day in Ohio, I was at Kent State University and I was introduced by a man named Bruce Blair. He had been in the Air Force decades ago and he was a launch officer in our nuclear program, which meant that he sat in a bunker during his watch time, in case the president -- whoever the president was -- were to order a nuclear attack. And Bruce Blair knows there is no appeal from a president's order to launch a nuclear attack. There is no veto by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or anybody else. If a president orders a nuclear attack, there's about a four-minute window before it happens. I had never met Mr. Blair before. He's gone on to have a very distinguished career in security studies. But as he was watching this campaign and reflecting on the service he did as a young man, he realized he could never support Donald Trump. And he called other launch officers -- sometimes called missileers -- and asked them what they were thinking. And to a person, they said ""This is unacceptable. This is actually scary."" So several dozens of them wrote a letter saying that they know what the awesome responsibility is that a president of the United States holds and they could never support Donald Trump to be our president and commander-in-chief. <APPLAUSE> And if you -- if you believe, like I do, that our economy grows and America thrives when the middle class grows and thrives, then you have to vote too. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II -- jobs and infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing, and clean energy, small business jobs. I want to be the best small business president we've ever had... <APPLAUSE> ... to enable more people to get started and grow their businesses. In contrast, my opponent built his fortune on the backs of small business owners. But I'm the daughter of a small businessman and I am just so glad my dad never got a contract from Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE> Because so many who did were stiffed. But I want to make sure that we have easier access to capital, less red tape, more tax relief for people willing to take the risk of going in to small businesses. I also think it's imperative that we make our economy fairer. And that means I do support raising the national minimum wage. <APPLAUSE> Because, as I said, I believe in work. That's how I was raised. And I think we can do better for people who work full-time and still are mired in poverty. We want to get back to having ladders of opportunity. If you work in America, you ought to be able to get ahead in America and we're going to make that happen again. <APPLAUSE> And we've got to start recognizing that families need more support. And that's why I want to make child care affordable, instead of costing as much as tuition. <APPLAUSE> And it is time that we had paid family leave so that you can take care of the most important obligations that you have. <APPLAUSE> And it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work. <APPLAUSE> And you know, this is not just a woman's issue. This is a family issue. If you have a mother, a wife, sister, or daughter, this is your issue. And this is an issue worth voting on, because it's time we made it fair for working women. <APPLAUSE> And if you believe all of our kids should have the chance to thrive in good schools, with good teachers, no matter what zip code they live in, then you have to vote, because we've got to make public education work for everyone. <APPLAUSE> And I think we need some water. Yes -- do we have some water that we can get here? If we -- if we have some water, that would be a big help. Okay, great. Now, look, I -- I think, when it comes to education, we do need to have high-quality, affordable, pre-kindergarten in every community. I also believe we need to bring back technical and vocational education into our high schools. <APPLAUSE> Because a four-year college degree should not be the only path to a good job and a middle-class life in New Hampshire or in America. <APPLAUSE> And for anyone who does want to go to college, we are going to make it affordable. <APPLAUSE> Now, after the primary was over -- and I have to say, you all cleaned my clock in the primary. I know. <LAUGHTER> But it was a great primary because it was about ideas and issues, not insults. And I'm proud of the race that Senator Sanders and I ran. <APPLAUSE> And -- and when it was over -- when it was over, we got together and we sat down, and we said how can we work to deal with a lot of the issues that we were both concerned about in the primary. And we've put together a plan -- public colleges and universities should be tuition free for everyone who makes less than $125,000 a year. <APPLAUSE> And it should be debt-free for everyone else. We have to treat it like an investment. <APPLAUSE> And Bernie and I were just in North Carolina campaigning together. And it's so exciting, because we know that not only do we have make college affordable, we also have to help the millions of Americans who are already struggling with student debt to ease that burden, get those interest rates down, make it so you never have to pay more than you can afford. <APPLAUSE> So, you see, working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now. And -- and it will be our mission together, doing everything we can to help all our kids and every American have the chance to live up to their god-given potential. I am taking very seriously the obligation that I feel to reach out to all Americans. I'm asking for the support, not just of Democrats, but also Republicans and independents in this election. <APPLAUSE> I want to be the president for all Americans -- those who vote for me and those who do not vote for me, because we have to heal this country, and that's going to take everyone. <APPLAUSE> We have to remember how to disagree without being so disagreeable. <APPLAUSE> And you know, it is unusual for somebody running for president to say that what we need more of in our country is love and kindness, but we really do -- toward one another, toward people different from ourselves. <APPLAUSE> We all have a role in building a better, stronger, fairer America and I am very honored to have gotten the kind of support I have received from republicans here in New Hampshire. And I really am very grateful for the recent statement by former Senator, Gordon Humphrey, about what's at stake in this election. <APPLAUSE> So -- you know, we can't do any of this work unless we're successful on Tuesday. It really all starts then. Our future is in our hands. And anyone who says they're going to stay on the sidelines, or it doesn't matter, really doesn't understand what's at stake in this election. We've got to get every American eligible to vote, registered to vote. And here in New Hampshire, you've got same- day registration, so you can all get out and vote. <APPLAUSE> We've got to get everyone to believe that this election is about you. It is about you -- your dreams, your aspirations, your hopes, your family, your community. I have never felt more strongly about what we can do together. I am confident and I am optimistic about the future we can make together. If you don't know where you're supposed to vote, you can go to Iwillvote.com. They will tell you there. You can still volunteer. We have been knocking on hundreds of thousands of doors. I bet some of yours, right? And some of you did the knocking. <APPLAUSE> But we are -- we are not taking anyone, or anything, or anyplace for granted. So if you want to volunteer, you can go to HillaryClinton.com, or text JOIN, 47246. It really comes down, as far as I'm concerned, for me personally, to my grandchildren, because I feel very blessed that I have had opportunities in our country because of my family and because of what others had done to prepare the path for me, going back to our founding. And I really want each and every one of us to think for a moment about how we would feel on November 9th if we were not successful. When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you're able to say you voted -- you voted for a better, stronger, fairer America. <APPLAUSE> An America where we build bridges, not walls. <APPLAUSE> An America where we prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate. Let's go vote, New Hampshire. Thank you. God bless you.","The Grammar Lab"

<CLINTON:> Oh, my goodness. Thank you! <APPLAUSE> Thank you all so much. <APPLAUSE> It is great to be back in Cleveland. I am thrilled to see all of you. I have to really thank LeBron, what he does on the basketball court you all know, it makes him so special, it makes him a champion. <APPLAUSE> But I am just as impressed, as I have told him, about what he does off the court. <APPLAUSE> Because what he does off the court is to care for every child as though that child were his own. He has been so committed through the LeBron family, the LeBron James Family Foundation. He's using the national platform he earned to advocate for children everywhere, especially right here in Ohio. <APPLAUSE> And it was an extra-special treat to have J.R. Smith here as well. <APPLAUSE> I can't tell you how exciting it is for me to have LeBron and J.R. part of the team that's going to take us to the White House starting on Tuesday. <APPLAUSE> I also have to thank a lot of the elected officials that I've worked with that I have such high regard for. Let me thank your senator, Sherrod Brown. <APPLAUSE> Let me thank your amazing, absolutely indefatigable congresswoman, Marcia Fudge. <APPLAUSE> Let me thank your county executive Armond Budish. <APPLAUSE> And let me thank and hope you will vote for your former governor, Ted Strickland, to be your next senator. <APPLAUSE> I want to thank the D.J. Steph Floss for his musical performance. <APPLAUSE> And I want to thank a very special young man, Yusef Salaam, who was out here. <APPLAUSE> A young man who has turned what was a very bitter and unjust experience into an opportunity to try to help lift others up. Now, I was thrilled to be here on Friday night with Jay Z and Beyonce. <APPLAUSE> Beyonce even had her dancers in blue pantsuits, which I love. <APPLAUSE> But what was most important was how Beyonce and Jay Z talked about what this election means for their daughter and for all of our daughters and sons. And that's why I am so grateful to them as well as to LeBron because this election really is about the future and it's about your kids and grandkids and every child in this country that we hope will have their own shot at the American dream. They may not all become champion basketball players, but everybody should have the right to go as far as their hard work and talent will take them in America. <APPLAUSE> So let me ask you this, are you ready to vote? <APPLAUSE> Are you ready to volunteer for the next few days? <APPLAUSE> Are you ready to choose our next president? <APPLAUSE> Well, I think by now you know the choice could not be any clearer. It really is a choice between division or unity, between an economy that works for everyone or one that is stacked for those at the top, between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon. And as you think about this choice, I want you to know where I am coming from, because what I want to do as your president is really to build on and continue what I've done my entire life, fighting for kids and families... <APPLAUSE> ... standing up for our country. If you elect me on Tuesday, that's what I will do every day as your president. Because from the start, our campaign has been focused on you. You know, I have now spoken in front of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people in small groups and big events. And what I try to do while I'm up here speaking is to really look at the faces of the people in front of me because I don't know your dreams, I don't know your struggles, but I want so much to convey to you that I will be on your side, I will fight for you, fight for your families, fight for your futures. <APPLAUSE> I want us to do all we can to help you get ahead and stay ahead. And my vision is very different from my opponent's. Look, we know, we know enough about what he says and what he's done. You don't need to go through the litany of all the people he's insulted and demeaned. But the bottom line is, his vision of America is so dark and divisive. It's not the America that I see as I travel around our country. I want us to have a vision that is hopeful, optimistic and unified about what we can do together to make sure America's best years are ahead of us. <APPLAUSE> I love our country and I believe in our people. And I will never ever quit on you... <APPLAUSE> ... no matter what. Now, that is not to say we don't have our challenges. Of course we do, we're just human beings. But boy, we have so many assets, we have so many opportunities. And never forget, America is great because America is good. <APPLAUSE> And if we act like that, we lift each other up instead of tearing each other down. We can be even greater. We've come through some tough economic times and lots is changing in our country. There are powerful forces inside and outside of America that do threaten to pull us apart. And we've arrived at a moment of reckoning in this election. Our core values as Americans are being tested. I think of all the people I've met across the country in this campaign, I've heard some really, really sad stories. You know, when you run for president, at least for me, the moments that stand out are about somebody grabbing my hand. I'll be in a coffee shop or maybe shaking hands on a rope line and somebody will grab my hand and they will share a really personal feeling or experience with me. A lot of times it's about problems or troubles in their families. And I feel like they are entrusting me with this really important piece of their lives. I walk away from that motivated, but I also walk away confident. My faith in our future has never been stronger. And I know if we come together, not just to win the election, that's just the beginning, but then to work together, there is something for every one of us to do in our own lives, our families, our neighborhoods and communities. I want an America where everyone has a place, where everyone's included. And, you know, I know there's a lot of frustration and even anger in this election season. I see it, I hear it, sometimes, you know, I'm the subject of it. I get it. But anger is not a plan. Anger is not going to get us new jobs with rising incomes... <APPLAUSE> ... that will create a strong, thriving middle class. I believe that we're going to grow this economy. We're going to grow it from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. <APPLAUSE> That is what my opponent offers. And it might work for him, right? It might. But it's not going to work for the vast majority of working Americans. That's why I want us to have a big infrastructure jobs program. That is so much work to be done, good, honest, honorable... <APPLAUSE> ... dignified work, our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our tunnels, our water systems. And these are jobs that can't be exported. They've got to be done right here in Cleveland... <APPLAUSE> ... in Youngstown, in Dayton, in Akron, in Columbus and Cincinnati. And we're going to bring back advanced manufacturing to Ohio and elsewhere in our country. Now, some people when I say this, they kind of, you know, look at me like, well, that's not going to happen. It is going to happen. And I'll tell you, two of my strongest allies are going to be Sherrod Brown and Marcia Fudge and I hope Ted Strickland when he gets to Washington. <APPLAUSE> People say to me all the time, well, how are you going to get anything done? Won't there be gridlock? There will only be gridlock if people that are elected to represent you don't want to help you. It's not complicated, my friends. If they want to keep helping the wealthy, the powerful and the well-connected, yeah, then we're going to have gridlock, because I want jobs with rising incomes, I want people having a better shot at the future. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to have more clean, renewable-energy jobs to combat climate change and put Americans to work. <APPLAUSE> And I want to be the best president small business has ever had because that's where most of the new jobs will come from. <APPLAUSE> And once we get these new jobs and we start producing more things in America, I want people to buy those things in America. <APPLAUSE> You know, any of you see the debates? <APPLAUSE> You know, in that last debate, I pointed out that Donald Trump has bought Chinese steel to build his last two buildings, all the while he's been running around Ohio talking about what a great advocate he's going to be for working people. <BOOING> He didn't have to buy Chinese steel, he didn't have to help employ Chinese steelworkers. He could have bought good American steel made by American steelworkers. <APPLAUSE> So don't just watch what we say, watch what we've done for the last 30 years and whose side we've bet on. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to make this economy fairer. Look, I really believe in hard work. That's how I was raised, that's the kind of family I came from. So I think everybody has to work. Everybody who can needs to work. But I do think we need to raise the national minimum wage... <APPLAUSE> ... because if you work full time you shouldn't still be in poverty. And I also think if you're working you ought to get paid fairly, which is why we need to guarantee equal pay for women's work. <APPLAUSE> And, you know, this is not a woman's issue, this is a family issue. Because if you've got a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter working, you don't want her shortchanged.
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<CLINTON:> And we need to start recognizing that a lot of the costs that families are facing now are really burdensome. I want to get child care affordable, right? <APPLAUSE> Do you know, in a lot of states right now, good child care costs as much or more than in-state college tuition. That's crazy. Who could afford that? And I want us to have paid family leave so if you get sick or your spouse is sick... <APPLAUSE> ... or your parent is sick or your child is sick or you bring a newborn home. Now, you know, I don't think these are luxuries anymore. I think these are all about rebuilding the American middle class. I believe it's all about respecting work, providing enough jobs for people to have a good future, getting incomes rising, making it work for everybody. And I have said I will pay for everything I'm proposing without adding a penny to the national debt, right? <APPLAUSE> And that is in very start contrast to my opponent, because what I've said is I am not raising taxes on the middle class. Anybody making less than $250,000 a year is not going to have any tax increase while I am president. <APPLAUSE> But I am going where the money is and the money is with the wealthy and corporations because they've done really well in the last 15 years. And they should pay their fair share to support our country. <APPLAUSE> And again, people say to me, well, how are you ever going to get that through Congress? Well, I'll tell you, I think it's pretty simple. I'm going to look at all the people, all the people who would be helped by everything I've just said, the new jobs and the rest of it, and I'm going to compare it to the very few people in every congressional district who would have their taxes raised. And I'm going to say, whose side are you on, Mr. or Madam Congresswoman? Are you supporting the five people in your district who will have their taxes raised or are you supporting the 500,000 people who will be benefited by what we're going to do together? <APPLAUSE> And another big barrier that we've got to knock down is making college affordable for every single person. <APPLAUSE> It's outrageous. I meet people across America who couldn't afford to start college, could not afford to stay and never graduated and still have debt. They don't have a degree, but they've got debt. That's crazy and I see some people pointing to themselves. I've got to tell you, look, I believe that education is an investment. That's why I want good schools with good teachers in every ZIP Code in America. <APPLAUSE> That's why I want to get more technical education back into high schools because I think there are a lot of great jobs waiting to be done by people who have the skills from high school or community college... <APPLAUSE> ... or apprenticeship programs. I'm going to do everything I can to lift up and honor hard work. When somebody can make something, when somebody is a machinist or a tool and dye maker or a carpenter or even a computer coder, that may not at all require a four-year college education. And it's about time we honored all work in America and made all work pay for everybody. <APPLAUSE> But for people who want to go to college, we're going to make it easier. I want every public college and university to be tuition-free for families making less than $125,000 a year... <APPLAUSE> ... and debt-free for everybody else because this should be seen as an investment. And if you are struggling with student debt, we've got a plan to ease that burden, get the costs down, get the interest rates down, get it paid off much faster. You see, I really believe that every single person should be able to go as far as you're willing to work for it and not have your dreams dashed while you're a child or a teenager or a young adult. Elections are about the future, so let's lift up the young people of America! <APPLAUSE> And that includes let's dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-college pipeline. <APPLAUSE> We have a lot of work to do. I've laid out a full agenda. Tim Kaine, my running mate, and I, we've written a book called ""Stronger Together."" And in it it tells you everything we want to try to do. And I've got to tell you, I think it's important you know what we want to do. It shouldn't just be an election about words, it should be about plans and policies so that you can judge and say, what will help me? Like, for example, on college, you can go to my website, HillaryClinton.com, right now, HillaryClinton.com/calculator and you can see how much money you and your family would save under my plan. And I want to be real specific. I want to rebuild confidence in what we can do together. It's not good for anybody that our democracy and our country are viewed so suspiciously, without confidence. That is how we govern ourselves, so we have to work together. But I can't do any of this if you don't vote. <APPLAUSE> Now, so far, 1.6 million people in Ohio have voted. <APPLAUSE> But we've got work to do. So, please, you've got to get out, you've got to get to the polls, you've got to take people to the polls. Nobody should sit this one out. You can go to IwillVote.com to find out what your polling place is. Or you can volunteer to help us these next few days. You can text ""JOIN,"" J-O-I-N, to 47246. And I'm really ready to get to work for you. This is about what we can do together. <APPLAUSE> It's about the kind of future we can create and build. And it is an opportunity for all of us to be invested in a better, fairer, stronger America. I want us to do this together. I really do believe my slogan, ""Stronger Together."" <APPLAUSE> So I hope Ohio will turn out in the biggest-recorded vote in history on Tuesday. <APPLAUSE> And we will together prove once and for all that love trumps hate! Thank you all very much!","The Grammar Lab"

<CLINTON:> Hello, Pittsburgh! <APPLAUSE> Whoa! Hello, back there.
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> Thank you. Thank you. Wow. <APPLAUSE><APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> It's great to be here at this extraordinary time in our country's history at this great university. <APPLAUSE> To have a chance on a beautiful day to lift our sights, to think about what we are capable of doing together, the kind of future that we can create if we search for and find common ground. And it is thrilling to have traveled across our country to see the hopefulness. To talk about the positive changes that are occurring, to really see America at its best. And tomorrow each and every one of you gets to make a decision as to whether or not first you will vote, because in Pennsylvania it is all about Election Day. <APPLAUSE> Other places around the country have been voting for weeks, and what you will vote for. I am here to ask you to vote for yourselves, vote for your families, vote for your futures. Vote on the issue that matter to you because they are on the ballot, not just my name and my opponent's name. <APPLAUSE> I want to thank Tom Colicchio for coming out here. He is in the middle of opening up another one of his great restaurants. But he said he has these two small kids and he just had to come and be apart of lifting up this election and creating the kind of commitment that will bring a record-breaking number Americans to vote. We are on the path to see more Americans vote than we have ever seen in our history. <APPLAUSE> I am hoping that you wont just come out and vote. Obviously I hope you vote for me, but I also hope -- I hope that you will send Katie McGinty to the United States Senate. <APPLAUSE> We've got some great elected officials here and I want to recognize Congressmen Mike Doyle. <APPLAUSE> County executive Rich Fitzgerald. From Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peitersen. <APPLAUSE> From Braddock PA, Mayor John Fetterman. <APPLAUSE> But mostly I am here to say thanks. Thanks for taking time out to think about what's the stakes are -- I love you all too, absolutely. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> So for those who are still making up your minds or thinking maybe its not worth voting at all, let me just say, the choice in this election could not be clearer. It really is between division or unity. Between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon. Between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and an economy that is set up and run for those at top. Now I have spent my public career fighting for kids and families and standing up for our country. And if you give me the privilege of your vote tomorrow that is what I will do every single day of my presidency. <APPLAUSE> I will get up in the White House and I will think about what I can do that day to knock down barriers to create opportunities so that you have the chance to fulfill your own dreams. You see, I believe America's best days are still ahead of us.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> Now, that doesn't mean we do have to work for it, because we do. That doesn't mean we can just expect it to happen as kind of a birthright. But I really believe that. I would not have work for 18 months, traveled across our country, fought as hard as I have about what we need to do and how to do it together, proudly stand up and defend the legacy of President Obama which has... <APPLAUSE> ... given our country progress in the right direction, if I did not believe with all my heart that we could do this. Right? <APPLAUSE> We can do this! <APPLAUSE> We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. <APPLAUSE> And our core values are being tested in this election. And I know that people are frustrated. A lot of people feel left out and left behind. There's fear even anger in our country. But I've got to say anger is not a plan my friends. If we're going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems, then we've got to start talking to each other again. <APPLAUSE> And we have to get good ideas wherever they come from. Last night I was in Manchester, New Hampshire and I was with Khizr Khan whose son Captain Khan was killed while serving in Iraq. You might remember him from the Democratic Convention. He was not a man to be on the stage of a political convention. But when he heard my opponent say what he said about Muslims and he looked at the flag that had been draped on his son's coffin, he felt compelled to speak out. He spoke powerfully about what America means to him, and how we have to defend our values and our Constitution. As he said last night, his son, serving in the United States Army with his unit saw something suspicious, moved toward it to check it out, telling his men to stay behind. And when the car exploded, he lost his life <inaudible> the Bronze Star and the Purple <inaudible>. But as Mr. Khan said when you listen to all of the people that my opponent has insulted and denigrated, would there be a place in Donald Trump's America for Captain Khan? The Khan family gives me hope because they truly believe in the values of <inaudible> of ours. And they have stood up, holding the Constitution as he did at the <inaudible> to say people around the world, cherish this Constitution, believe in our values <inaudible> for billions of people we will never, ever let that go. And we will <inaudible> someone rip it away in the kind of negative divisive, hateful campaign that we have seen <inaudible> in this election. <APPLAUSE> Sometimes when I hear my opponent speak, I don't recognize <inaudible>. It doesn't mean we don't have problems and challenges. It doesn't mean that <inaudible> to do more to help our country get better economic opportunities. Of course we do. <inaudible> I believe we could <inaudible>. I love our country. <inaudible> the American people. I know what we are capable of. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> throughout our history generations of Americans have risen together to meet the test of their time. They defended Democracy, built the greatest middle class the world has <inaudible>, marched for civil rights, for workers' rights <inaudible>, rights for people with disabilities.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> <inaudible> we face the test <inaudible>. Will we be coming together as a nation <inaudible> further apart? Will we set goals that all of us <inaudible> meet? Will we turn on each other and pit one group of Americans <ph> against another? Now, our names will be on the ballot tomorrow, but those values and <inaudible> you care about will be <ph> there too. What kind of country do we want? And I particularly think about this for young people as I look at <inaudible> so many <inaudible> Americans who deserve the same opportunities and the <inaudible> many of us were given. <APPLAUSE> We will make sure they are available, because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving America, it comes down to a couple of key <inaudible>. If you believe that America thrives when the middle <inaudible>, then you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II; jobs in infrastructure, small business, clean energy, advanced manufacturing. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna actually deliver on that, unlike my opponent, who makes his products mostly overseas <inaudible> Chinese steel and aluminum <inaudible> made by American steel workers right here in Pennsylvania. <BOOING> <inaudible> in American and we're especially going to invest in communities that are left out <inaudible> stand up for the <inaudible> across America. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> economy as I do, then the national <inaudible> because nobody who works <inaudible> be in poverty. <APPLAUSE> And we're gonna do more to support working families with affordable childcare <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> I've got to tell you. This <inaudible> the biggest applause ever because <inaudible> know it's not fair, but it's also <inaudible> working, you don't want <inaudible> do you?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<CLINTON:> When I talk about equal pay and all these other family <inaudible> my opponent says I'm playing the woman's card. Well, you know what I <inaudible> deal me in. <APPLAUSE> You know, if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP code they <inaudible> you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> If <inaudible> that we can make college <inaudible> for every young <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> <AUDIO GAP>
<CLINTON:> And after it was over, he and I got together and we came up with this plan. Public colleges and universities should be tuition free for everyone who makes less than $125,000 a year. <APPLAUSE> And it should be debt-free for everyone else. I don't think you should go into this massive debt to get your education. It's good for you, it's good for your families, it's good for our country. And we're going to make it affordable for everyone. <APPLAUSE> And for the millions of Americans already struggling with student debt, we're going to ease that burden. We're going to get those interest rates down. We're going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income. Not tied to a six, eight, ten percent interest rate. <APPLAUSE> And you're never going to have to pay more than you can afford. <APPLAUSE> You see, I think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about. And I think the agenda we've put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope. You see, working for children and families has been the cause of my life but it's never been more important than it is right now. So this has to be our mission together. Doing all we can to help every American, especially every young American and especially every child to have the chance to live up to your God-given potential. Because when it's all said and done, that's what matters most. Have you helped somebody else? Have you reached out and tried to ease somebody's burden? We do it individually. My mother got through a neglected, abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness. Her own parents didn't want her, her grandparents didn't want her. But that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat. <APPLAUSE> And when she was 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody's home, she was just relieved that she had a place to live and that she could support herself. But the mother of that home understood my mom wanted to go to high school. So she said, ""Dorothy, if you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school. You'll have to come right back because we'll need you, but you can do it."" Now look, that sounds harsh to our ears, telling a 14-year-old, ""OK, you can go to high school but you've got to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it."" But to my mother it was a blessing.
<CLINTON:> So when I think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we have had -- and I'm speaking for myself. My mother gave me the resilience, the grit, the get up and go. She told me everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up. <APPLAUSE> And we had a lot of Americans knocked down because of the Great Recession, didn't we? Millions of jobs were lost, millions of homes were lost. Family wealth was wiped out, savings accounts, 401<k>s, everything that people had worked so hard for. Well, we've dug ourselves out of the hole, now we've got to get up. And we've got to make sure we don't leave anybody behind. I see this man standing here with a sign, coal miners for Hillary, and I'll tell you, sir... <APPLAUSE> I know how hard times are and as I have said and you can take it to the bank, I will not forget you and I will do everything I can to help people who have given so much, worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country. We are not gonna forget any American! <APPLAUSE> But I can't do any of this without your help tomorrow. This election is going to really set the course of our country. There's no doubt in my mind. Tonight, I'll be in Philadelphia with President Obama and Michelle. <APPLAUSE> And I so appreciate how hard they have worked for me, but it's not for me. It's for us. You know, when President Obama came into office, put yourself in his shoes, this young, dynamic, first African- American elected to become president of the United States. <APPLAUSE> And what does he find? He finds the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, that's what he finds. Wow, those were hard, hard times. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didn't go even deeper into the ditch we were in. <APPLAUSE> But make no mistake, there were reasons we ended up in that ditch, it didn't happen by accident. We had huge tax cuts on the wealthy. The administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened. They ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened. Elections have consequences for everything we care about, and that's why we've got to have each and every one of you put down your stake in our future. If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait. <APPLAUSE> In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours. And there have been reporters and others going up and down the line, asking people, all kinds Americans, not one type, all types. Why are you here? Because my future depends on it, they say.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> So tomorrow is the election, but that is just the beginning. We have to heal this country. We have to bring people together, listen and respect each other. Now, I know it's unusual for somebody running for president to say this, I started saying this months ago because I literally was meeting people who were scared by what they were hearing in the election. You know, I've known a lot of the Republicans who've run for president, been elected president in recent history. I didn't agree with them on everything. Obviously, we had our differences. But I didn't doubt that they were fit to serve as president. This election's different. This person is temperamentally unqualified, experientially unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief. And so many people know that. <APPLAUSE> So I think we do need some more love and kindness. Right? <APPLAUSE> We have got to rise above all of this hate-filled rhetoric, all of these insults and scapegoating and finger-pointing and insulting. I want to be the president for all Americans, not just some. I want to be the president for Democrats, Republicans and independents. <APPLAUSE> I want to be the president for those who vote for me and those who vote against me. I want to represent everybody. <APPLAUSE> Because I know we have a role to play in building a better future. So it starts tomorrow. If you don't know where to vote, go to iwillvote.com. You can get all the information you need. The polls will be open from seven A.M. to eight P.M. We are on track, as I said, to have a huge turnout. But we can only do that if all of you make up your minds, you bring your friends, everybody you know to make sure your voices are heard. This is a historic election and we're going to do everything we can not only to win, but then immediately to get to work. And I especially... <APPLAUSE> I especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next 24 hours, go to Hillaryclinton.com, text join JOIN, J-O-I-N, to 47246. Stop by one of our offices, we would love to see you. Because when your kids and your grandkids ask you in the future what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America where we build bridges, not walls. <APPLAUSE> And where we finally <inaudible> for all that love trumps hate!
<AUDIENCE: Love trumps hate!>

<CLINTON:> Hello Grand Valley. 
<CROWD: Hillary. Hillary. Hillary.>
<CLINTON:> Thank you. Thank you.
<CROWD: Hillary. Hillary. Hillary.>
<CLINTON:> It is great to be back in western Michigan. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Are there any Lakers here? <APPLAUSE> Oh, my gosh. I am so thrilled to be here. I want to thank the president of this great university, Tom Haas, the faculty, the staff, the students. I want to thank Brandon Dillon, the Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party ... <APPLAUSE> ... and I especially really want to thank you for sending Debbie Stabenow to the United States Senate. <APPLAUSE> I have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with Debbie, gotten to know her, become a friend of hers, and I am so excited at the possibility that I'll be able to work with her again. But I want you to know this - and I really, really hope you'll tell folks, because there is no more dedicated, effective member of the United States Senate than Debbie Stabenow. <APPLAUSE> She fights for all of you every day, but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face. And she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking. And don't we need more of that in Washington where people actually talk and listen to each other. So it's wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by Debbie. Are you ready to vote tomorrow, Michigan? <APPLAUSE> Are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow? That is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow. <APPLAUSE> The choice in this election could not be clearer. And I know that for many people, you've gone back and forth, you've thought about what to do, and I really respect that. But let me say this. Let me say this. This election is basically between division and unity in our country. <APPLAUSE> It's between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk. It is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top. And I want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about. Because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot, those issues, and those values, are on the ballot as well. And as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election. I have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades, and people who ran for president. I was privileged to know as a college student, Gerald Ford. <APPLAUSE> In fact, I had an internship with the House Republican Conference Committee, which he headed, after my junior year in college. So when I say I've gotten to know a lot of our presidents, and people who've run for president, it goes back a ways. And here's what I want you to understand. I didn't agree with everything they did or said. Even the Democrats. We had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle, but I never doubted, I never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commander-in-chief. <APPLAUSE> That's why this election is so different. And it's why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me, and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party. <APPLAUSE> Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election. <APPLAUSE> I was at Kent State, in Ohio, last week and I was introduced by a gentleman by the name of Bruce Blair. And Mr. Blair had served in the Air Force, he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer. That meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed. And his job - imagine the responsibility. A young Air Force officer in his twenties, waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons. And Bruce Blair explained that there is no appeal from a president's order to do that. The joint chiefs of our military forces can't say, ""No, don't do it."" There's no veto from Congress or anyone else. And the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes. So after watching this election Mr. Blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing. And several dozen of them - I'd never met them before - several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief. <APPLAUSE> The awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something I want you to think about between now and the time you vote. Because I will pledge to you that I will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency. <APPLAUSE>
<CROWD: Hillary. Hillary. Hillary.>
<CLINTON:> I also want to pose to you a contrast in visions. Did any of you see the debates? First of all, I did stand for four and a half hours with Donald Trump on the stage, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president. <APPLAUSE> But I have to say, in addition to that, there were so many things that he said that of course I sometimes was surprised by. But the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for America. Now I have to tell you, I know we've got problems. I've spent 18 months traveling around our country talking to - by now - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people, hearing what's on people's minds. We've got challenges but America's always had challenges. And since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together? <APPLAUSE> I often didn't recognize the country that Donald Trump was describing. Because from my perspective, looking back at our history, we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. And you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America that will set the stage for an even better future. <APPLAUSE> And I want to say especially to the students who are here - I really believe that America's best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together. <APPLAUSE> Make no mistake. Our core values are being tested in this election. But my faith in our future has never been stronger. Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was introduced by Mr. Khizr Khan. <APPLAUSE> Some of you know or remember that his son, Captain Khan, serving in the United States Army, was killed serving in Iraq. And like at the Democratic Convention this summer, he spoke powerfully about what America means to him. And how we have to defend our values and our Constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world. People look at us with yearning. They see that we are a beacon of freedom, hope and opportunity for people, right here, at home. <APPLAUSE> When I heard Mr. Khan speak at the convention, and I heard him again last night, I was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country. He said that when he started hearing Donald Trump speak, and all of the things he said about so many people, not only Muslims but African-Americans and Latinos and POWs and women and so many people - when he heard it he couldn't help but think as he walked around his house - he has a room where his son's medals - he got the Bronze Star, he got the Purple Heart - the flag that was draped on his coffin - is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in. And he thought to himself, ""Would there be any room for my son in Donald Trump's America?"" Think about that for a minute. Because every single one of us has something to contribute. To this great country. We are already great but we can be greater. And we will be greater ... <APPLAUSE> I love our country and I believe in the American people, and I know there is nothing we can't do when we make up our minds. Throughout our history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy. They built the greatest middle class the world has ever known. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights and union rights, for LGBT rights, rights for people with disabilities ... <APPLAUSE> ... and now we've got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the challenges of our time. We've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. <APPLAUSE> If you believe, as I do, that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow. <APPLAUSE> We are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. <APPLAUSE> These are jobs we need doing in American and these are jobs that cannot be exported. They've got to be done right here in Michigan and across our country. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing. I am not one of these folks who think, ""We just can't make it in America anymore."" And I'll tell you why. Because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan, we can lead the world in precision machining, in 3-D printing. We're not competing for low-wage jobs, we're competing with Germany for high manufacturing, high- skilled jobs. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to have clean, renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change. As you heard, my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas. And as I pointed out in the last debate, he buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of good American steel, made by American steel workers. <BOOING> He's gone all over this country, and he's gone all over Michigan, talking about how he's gonna really get more jobs and he's going to bring back what used to be there. Well I'll tell you what. Look at his record, don't just listen to his rhetoric. <APPLAUSE> Because I have a different idea. We're going to invest in America again. And for everybody who is frustrated, and anxious, and maybe even angry because they feel left out, left behind, that America's not working the way it should - I understand that. I understand that. I represented upstate New York for eight years, and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories, picking up and moving out. But I also realized that anger is not a plan. You've got to come together and figure out what is it we're gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people. <APPLAUSE> And I'll just tell you that I believe that we've got to defend the American worker's right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna get incomes rising here in western Michigan and across this state. And we're also gonna do more to help small business. My dad was a small businessman. He worked really hard. He ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies, and I would from time to time help him out. You take a silkscreen, you put it down on the long table, you pour the paint in, you do the squeegee, you pick it up - it wasn't automated, we were the automaters - and you'd go all the way down to one table, you'd go to the other table. So I know how hard people in small business work. And I also know something else. Donald Trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills. And I have said, ""I am sure glad my dad never got a contract from Donald Trump, because we could not have afforded that."" <APPLAUSE> But it's not just enough to grow the economy. We have to make it fairer. And if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote. I think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job. I believe in hard work. That's how I was raised. But I also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldn't still be in poverty at the end of the year. And I'm gonna raise the national minimum wage. And one of the things I've heard all over America, especially from young families, really from all families but particularly young families, is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected - like where do you find affordable quality childcare? In lots of states, it's more expensive than college tuition. We're gonna get the cost of childcare down. We're going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or you're sick you won't lose your job. <APPLAUSE> I saw the folks over there holding up the Tim Kaine sign and I really appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. I got to tell you - Tim and I were in Pittsburgh last month, with a big crowd, and we couldn't get everybody in, like today, so Tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby, probably about three years old. And he stopped to talk to her and she said, ""I came here because I wanted to tell you, and to tell Hillary Clinton, what happened to me."" She said that ""I had my baby, it was a hard labor and delivery and I needed some time off. And I called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so I won't be in for - I think she said two weeks - and they said, ""OK. You're fired."" That is legal in America, still. And what that does is to say that - wait a minute, do we really value children? Do we really value families? And we've got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today's America. <APPLAUSE> And then finally, I think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work. <APPLAUSE> And you know I gotta say - this always gets a huge round of applause, as you can tell - but this is not just a woman's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter, who's in the work force, you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family. <APPLAUSE> Just about everything I've said so far my opponent disagrees with. And whenever I talk about affordable childcare, and paid family leave, and equal pay - he says I'm playing the woman's card and you know what I say, if that's the case? Then deal me in. <APPLAUSE> And here's what else I want you to know. It's fair to ask, ""How are you going to pay for that?"" That's not only fair, that's necessary to ask. Because I want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as I expect you're a good steward of your family budget. I have proposed a very simple formula. I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year. <APPLAUSE> And for small businesses, we're gonna cut your taxes because I know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief. So instead, we're going where the money is, to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations. <APPLAUSE> And that is in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has proposed. His whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations. That is trickle-down economics on steroids. I profoundly disagree. I think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down. <APPLAUSE> When you think about it, Donald hasn't paid anything for 20 years. He's paid zero to support our military, our vets, Pell grants for students here at Grand Valley, our highways - and I am still pondering, I am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year. Especially when you're running casinos. I do not understand that. But that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he's not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting. And that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them. So, we'll still wonder. But what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs, not create jobs. And we can't afford that. We need to keep building. We have recovered from the worst financial crash since the Great Depression but we're not where we need to be yet. The last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down. And depriving people of the jobs that we want to create. <APPLAUSE> And if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> And if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote. I've got to say I am proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign about ideas and issues, not insults. And when it was over, we actually got together. What a novel idea. We wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared. SO Bernie and I worked on this plan together. Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than a $125,000 a year. And they should be debt-free for everyone else because nobody should go into debt. And if you have gone into debt, if you're among the millions of Americans who are struggling - as I see some hands pointing in the air - paying back your student debt, we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off. <APPLAUSE> It makes no sense at all. We have interest rates that are really low right now. Buy a car for what, 1 or 2 percent. You can buy a house for 3,4 percent. There are so many people who are paying 8, 10, 12, higher - 8, 10, 12 percent interest - how much? Twelve point seven. Fourteen point one. I got to tell you friends. That is outrageous. The federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college. <APPLAUSE> I can't wait to roll up my sleeves with Debbie and Bernie and we're gonna get to work right after this election if I am fortunate enough to win. <APPLAUSE> Look. Working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now. And that has to be our mission together. Doing all we can to help every American, and especially every young American and every child in America to have the chance to live up to their God-given potential. I will wake up every single day in the White House trying to figure out what I can do to make that a reality for you. <APPLAUSE> So after tomorrow the work will begin, and one of the highest priorities that I feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together. A lot of people say we've got to heal our country, or as the Bible says repair the breach. Because we have so much divisiveness right now. We've got to start listening to each other. Respecting each other. I know it is unusual, I admit, for somebody running for president, especially the day before an election, but I've been saying this for months. To say that we need more of two things right now. We need more love and kindness in America. <APPLAUSE> I don't know about you, I don't know about you but I bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe, I hope, we've all extended one. I am standing here today because my mother, who was abandoned by her parents, rejected by her grandparents, went to work at the age of 14 as a maid, and a babysitter, was extended kindness. Not by those who should have loved her, but by others. The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, who began bringing extra food. The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school. She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents' home and she got this job. And that woman said, ""I know you want to go to high school. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school, but you'll have to come back because we'll need you in the late afternoon."" Now that may sound harsh to say to a 14-year old but to my mother it was a gift. I tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others. And ... <APPLAUSE> There's a version of the golden rule in every major religion. And it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down. The question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up? And for people in our country who feel like they've been knocked down and nobody cares, nobody's paying attention, here's what I want you to know. If you give me the honor of being your president I'm gonna do everything I can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together. <APPLAUSE> Because I want to be a president for all Americans. <APPLAUSE> Democrats, Republicans, Independents. Not just the people who support me, everybody in this country. Because I believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future. So let's take that first step tomorrow. If you don't know where you're supposed to vote go to iwillvote.com - you can get all the information you need. If you want to help us bringing out the vote here in western Michigan in the last 24, 36 hours, you can still sign up to volunteer. Go to hillaryclinton.com. Or you can text join247246 or stop by one of our offices. We would be really excited to see you, because when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you'll be able to say that you voted for a better, stronger, fairer America. <APPLAUSE> An America where we build bridges, not walls. <APPLAUSE> And an America where we prove that yes, love trumps hate. Thank you all so much.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-07"">
<CLINTON:> Hello, Philadelphia! <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> Oh, thank you! I am so grateful to be here tonight to spend this time with all of you here in this historic spot. And to all the volunteers, the activists, the union organizers of the hard hats I see in the audience tonight... <APPLAUSE> ... thank you for coming out for one last rally before Election Day tomorrow. <APPLAUSE> And personally, I am so happy to be finishing this campaign with my husband and my daughter by my side. We've been traveling across the country separately trying to cover as much ground as possible and talk to as many voters as we can. But I'm really glad that we're all together tonight in Philadelphia with you. <APPLAUSE> And how great was it to have Jon Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen with us? <APPLAUSE> But in addition to all of that, what is so special for me is that we have our amazing president and first lady with us, because for now nearly eight years they have served our nation with grace, strength, brilliance and a whole lot of cool. <APPLAUSE> And they have shown us again and again, as Michelle said right here in Philadelphia back at our convention, when others go low, we go high.
<AUDIENCE: We go high! (APPLAUSE)>
<CLINTON:> I'm pretty sure, as they said tonight, that the best way to thank them is to do something really important tomorrow, to vote, every single one of you and every person you know. Because as the president just pointed out, there is a clear choice in this election, a choice between division or unity, between an economy that works for everyone or only those at the top, between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk. So make no mistakes, our core values are being tested in this election. We know enough about my opponent, we know who he is. The real question for us is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children. I'm proud that I had the chance to serve in President Obama's Cabinet. <APPLAUSE> And I am proud that I could watch the extraordinary service of our first lady. And one thing I know is that, like them, I love America and I know you do, too. <APPLAUSE> We love this country, we love what it stands for, not that we are blind to its flaws, its problems, its challenges. But I believe with all my heart that America's best days are still ahead of us... <APPLAUSE> ... if we reach for them together. We choose to believe in a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America, an America where everyone has a place, everyone's included, everyone has a chance to live up to their own God-given potential. <APPLAUSE> There have been so many memorable moments in this election, for me, and most of them revolve around the people that I've had the privilege of meeting. And last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I had the honor to be introduced by Khizr Khan, whose son, Captain Khan, was killed serving our country in Iraq. <APPLAUSE> Just as he did here at our convention, Mr. Khan again reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our Constitution. You remember the story of Captain Khan, the son of immigrants himself, brought here as a young child, who grew up to join the United States Army. And on that fateful day with his unit, he saw a suspicious car and he moved toward it to try to determine whether it was a danger or not, telling his men to stay back. The car was rigged, the bomb went off and he died protecting his men. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. And what Mr. Khan said last night is something I want us all to remember. He said, after the many derogatory and insulting comments that we've heard from Donald Trump, would his son, would Captain Khan have a place in Donald Trump's America? That's an important question for all of us, because we don't want to shrink the vision of this great country, we want to keep expanding it so that everyone -- everyone -- has a place to pursue your dreams, your aspirations, the future that you want to create for yourselves and everyone else. <APPLAUSE> Think about that when you go to the polls tomorrow. Think about how throughout our history generations of Americans just like us have come together to meet the tests of their time. And yes, as President Obama said, it started right here in Philadelphia when representatives from 13 unruly colonies came together to launch the greatest experiment the world has ever seen. Our parents and grandparents defended that democracy. They built the great American middle class. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights and women's rights, for LGBT rights and rights for people with disabilities. <APPLAUSE> And tomorrow we face the test of our time. What will we vote for, not just against? What will we decide is on the ballot? Because although my name and my opponent's name may be on the ballot, every issue you care about is on that ballot. If you believe that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> If you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP Code they live in, then you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> If you believe college should be more affordable, you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> If you believe we must reform our criminal justice system so everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law, you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> If you believe we need to protect our kids and pass common sense gun safety reforms, you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> If you believe we must raise the minimum wage and finally guarantee equal pay for women, then you need to vote. <APPLAUSE> Now, you know, every time I say that last part about equal pay for women, my opponent accuses me of playing the women's card. Well, you know what I say? If that's playing the women's card, then deal me in.
<AUDIENCE: Deal me in! (APPLAUSE)>
<CLINTON:> So it is not just my name or Donald Trump's name on the ballot tomorrow. Every issue you care about is at stake. And that is just the beginning because we have to bridge the divides in our country. I regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became.
<AUDIENCE: Not your fault. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)>
<CLINTON:> And by the way, did any of you see those debates? <APPLAUSE> Well, I stood next to Donald Trump for four-and-a-half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief. <APPLAUSE> But I have to say...
<AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!>
<CLINTON:> I have to say that there were so many really troubling things that my opponent has said, but probably the most horrifying was at the end of the last debate. After he has insulted everyone, more than half the population by the way, immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, POWs, Muslims, women, he then launches an attack on our democracy, refusing to say whether or not he would accept the outcome of the election. Well, let's show tomorrow there will be no question about the outcome of this election. <APPLAUSE> But I also want you to know I will be a president for all Americans... <APPLAUSE> ... Democrats, Republicans, independents, not just the people who support me in this election, everyone, because I believe we all have a role to play in building a better, fairer, stronger America, building on the progress that we have enjoyed under President Barack Obama over the last eight years. <APPLAUSE> I am not going to let anybody rip away the progress we've made and turn the clock back, sending us back in time where people are free to question the foundation of our country, what our Founders here did. You know, they did not agree on everything in case you haven't remembered. There were lots of contentious arguments, but they saw a higher purpose and they came together. That's what I want us to do. And we can take the first step tomorrow. Please, make a plan to vote. Pennsylvania, it all happens tomorrow. <APPLAUSE> If you text the word ""PLAN,"" P-L-A-N, to 47246, we will walk you through where to vote, when to vote, how to get there. You can do that right now. And please, tell your friends, your family, your neighbors. And you can go to IWillVote.com and get all the information you need. Every person who lives in Philadelphia lives within five blocks of your polling place. That's it, just five blocks. And the polls open at 7 a.m. and they close at 8 p.m. And remember, if you're in line at 8 p.m. they have to let you vote. <APPLAUSE> And so we need your help. In these last hours, we need your help knocking on doors and making phone calls, helping to turn people out, maybe helping people who need assistance to get to the polls. You can still volunteer by going to HillaryClinton.com, because none of us -- none of us -- want to wake up on Wednesday morning and wish we had done more. Years from today when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I want you to be able to say that you did vote, you voted for an inclusive, big-hearted, open-minded country future that will make sure that we all keep moving together, because I do believe we are stronger together. <APPLAUSE> And you voted for an America where we build bridges, not walls. <APPLAUSE> And maybe most importantly, you voted in great numbers to demonstrate conclusively, once and for all that, yes, love trumps hate. Let's get out and vote, Philadelphia, tomorrow! <APPLAUSE> Let's make history together. Thank you and God bless you!","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-08"">
<CLINTON:> Thank you all. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Well, I've got to tell you, this is sure worth staying up for. <APPLAUSE> It is so great to be here in Raleigh, here at North Carolina State. <APPLAUSE> And I cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to Lady Gaga. <APPLAUSE> One of the most inventive, creative and passionate performers, whose range goes from A to Z and beyond. And I was watching on the screen not only her perform, but all of you jumping and singing and waving. It was great. <APPLAUSE> Because you know what? That's what I want for America, and the young people of America -- the joy, the passion, the... <APPLAUSE> And you know, our long-term friend Jon Bon Jovi was with us. <APPLAUSE> He was with us up in Philadelphia where he and Bruce Springsteen sang. <APPLAUSE> And Jon said ""Well, hey, I want to go down to Raleigh"" and so here he is. <APPLAUSE> And you know, between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow, we are going to be living on a prayer. <APPLAUSE> I was really impressed when everybody's hand went up saying you'd already voted. Well, go find somebody else who hasn't voted, OK? <APPLAUSE> Bring out your friends, your roommates, strangers on the street. <LAUGHTER> Just stop and talk to them about what's at stake in this election because North Carolina is key. And it's not only important for our election. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper as your next governor? <APPLAUSE> Well, I sure hope so. I sure hope so and I hope you're ready to elect Linda Coleman your lieutenant governor. <APPLAUSE> And how about Dan Blue III for state treasurer? <APPLAUSE> And I really, really hope you will send Deborah Ross to Washington. <APPLAUSE> Now, we are all fired up. When we were with the president and Michelle in Philadelphia... <APPLAUSE> ... you know, the president was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is and of course it is. I -- I really believe it's the most important election of our lifetimes because we've never had a clearer choice. Never. <APPLAUSE> It is a choice between division or unity, between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything. <APPLAUSE> It's a choice between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and it... <APPLAUSE> ... it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as Americans. What I saw before I came in and what I see now is a sense of potential, of joy. There is no reason, my friends, why America's best days are not ahead of us if we... <APPLAUSE> ... reach for them together. <APPLAUSE> We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. <APPLAUSE> Our core values -- our core values are being tested in this election. But my faith in our future has never been stronger. I love our country and I believe in the American people. And I know if we bring everyone together, we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves. <APPLAUSE> You know, one of the -- one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country as I have in this campaign is meeting remarkable people. People who stand up against the odds. People who, like my late mother, people who understand that everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up. Whether you believe you can keep going. <APPLAUSE> Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man, Khizr Khan who's son Captain Khan was killed serving our country in Iraq. <APPLAUSE> You may remember Mr. Khan's speech at the Democratic Convention., and... <APPLAUSE> Again, last night, he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our Constitution. The story of Captain Khan is one of courage in the face of danger. He was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle. He told his men to stay back. He moved toward the vehicle to check it out and the bomb went off. He lost his life, but everyone else in his unit survived. He was awarded the Bronze Star. <APPLAUSE> And this intensely personal tragedy that the Khan family experiences, becoming a Gold Star family, was one that they thought about, grieved over in the privacy of their home. Until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in America and who wasn't. The categories of people, starting with immigrants, including African-Americans and Latinos and POWs and Muslims. The list went on and on. And it created in Mr. Khan a sense of despair because he asked himself: Would his son have a place in Donald Trump's America, someone who paid the ultimate price in serving our country? Well, we can answer that question tomorrow, resoundingly, yes, absolutely. <APPLAUSE> Think about -- think about how generations of Americans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their time. Our parents, our grandparents, our great-grandparents defended democracy. They built the great American middle class. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights and women's rights, for <inaudible> and the rights of people with disabilities. And tomorrow we face the test of our time. So, remember, it's not just my name or Donald Trump's name on the ballot. It's the kind of country we want. It's every issue anyone cares about. So if you believe America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow. If you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean energy, small business, then you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> If you believe we need more fairness in our economy, to raise the minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty, then you have to vote. If you believe we need to do more to support working families with affordable child care, paid leave and equal pay for women, then you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> And remember, when my opponent says every time I talk about these issues that I'm playing the woman's card, well, you know what I say deal me in. <APPLAUSE> And if you believe -- if you believe all kids deserve good schools with good teachers, no matter what ZIP code they live in, you have to vote. And if you believe college should be more affordable, you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> Bernie Sanders and I worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free... <APPLAUSE> ... if you earn less than $125,000, and debt-free for everybody else. <APPLAUSE> And for the millions of Americans struggling with student debt, we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off. <APPLAUSE> If you believe in science and that we've got to address climate change, you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> If you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so... <APPLAUSE> ... then you have to vote. And if you believe -- if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws... <APPLAUSE> ... well then, you know -- you know, North Carolina, you've got to vote to get rid of HB2. <APPLAUSE> Now, this is so energizing. We could -- we could keep going with a long list. <APPLAUSE> But here's what -- here's what else I want you to know. Good thing this election didn't land during exams. That's all I can say. <APPLAUSE> Look, tomorrow -- tomorrow night, this election will end, but I want you to understand our work together will be just beginning. <APPLAUSE> We have to bridge the divides in this country. As the Bible says, we have to repair the breaches. We've got to be willing to start listening to each other again, respecting each other again. <APPLAUSE> And I -- I want to thank Gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting... <APPLAUSE> So, I want you to know and I want you to spread the word, I do want to be president for all Americans, not just some, not just the people who support me and vote for me. I want to be president for everyone.

<date:""2016-11-09"">
<KAINE: My wife, Anne, and I are so proud of Hillary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) I'm proud of Hillary Clinton because she has been and is a great history maker in every thing that she has done as a civil rights lawyer and first lady of Arkansas and first lady of this country and senator and secretary of state.>
<KAINE: She has made history. In a nation that is good at so many things, but that has made it uniquely difficult for women to be elected to federal office, she became the first major party nominee as a woman to be president and last night won the popular vote of Americans for the president. (APPLAUSE) That is an amazing accomplishment. It is an amazing accomplishment. I'm proud of Hillary Clinton because in the words of Langston Hughes, she's ""held fast to dreams."" She was inspired at a young age to an epiphany that if families and children do well, that's the best barometer of whether society does well. In everything she's done, she's focused on that. We know she would have made history as a president in one sense, but we never have had a president who's made their whole career about the empowerment of families and children. And I was as excited about that in the Oval Office as I was excited to have my friend Hillary there and make history as the first woman president. I'm excited and proud of Hillary because she has built such a wonderful team. There is a... (APPLAUSE) There's a beautiful and kind of comical parable in the New Testament about a vineyard owner who hires people to work and says I'm going to pay you this for a full day. Then he hires people at noon, I'm going to pay you the same thing for the half day. Then he hires people one hours work, I'm going to pay you the same. And those who started earlier in the day said hold on, we don't like this, that you're treating everybody who came late just as well as you're treating us. I'm going to tell you something, here's what I've come to know so well about Hillary. The team that she has assembled over the years of people that are so deeply loyal to her because she's so deeply loyal to them is inspiring. But I've seen that same degree of loyalty and compassion and sensitivity extended to the most recent folks who have joined the team, the folks who came to the vineyard with just one hour to go. Her loyalty and compassion of Hillary and Bill to people, if you're with you you're with you. And that is just something so remarkable. And finally, I'm proud of Hillary because she loves this country. (APPLAUSE) Nobody -- nobody had to wonder about Hillary Clinton, whether she would accept an outcome of an election in our beautiful democracy. Nobody had to ask that question. Nobody had to doubt it. She knows our country for what it is. She knows the system that we have and its warts and blemishes. She's deeply in love with it and accepts it. She's been in battles before where if it didn't go her way she accepted it, but then woke up the next day and battled again for the dreams that she's held fast to. And that love of country is something that I think is obvious to everybody, obvious to everyone. I want to thank Hillary Clinton for asking Anne and I to join this wild ride. We -- about a week before she asked if I would be her running mate, Anne and I went up to Westchester and we sat down with Hillary and Bill and with Chelsea and Mark and with Charlotte and Aiden for about three hours of conversation to try to determine whether we would be the right people to be on the ticket. And when we got in the car to head back to the airport after the three hour discussion, I said to Anne, ""Honey, I don't know whether we're going to be on this ticket or not, but I do know this, we're going to remember that three hours for the rest of our life."" And now, we've -- we'll remember 105 days that we've had with this fantastic couple of public servants and all of you for the rest of our life. I'll just say this. Hillary and I know well the wisdom and the words of William Faulkner. He said, ""They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yet."" (APPLAUSE) ""They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yet,"" because we know that the work remains. We know that the dreams of empowering families and children remain. And in that work, that important work that we have to do as a nation, it is so comforting even at a tough time to know that Hillary Clinton is somebody until her very last breath is going to be battling for the values that make this nation great and the values that we care so deeply about.>
<KAINE: So now, please join me in welcoming Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton. (APPLAUSE)>
<CLINTON:> Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. <APPLAUSE> Very rowdy group. Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so very much for being here and I love you all, too. Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country. But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together, this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life. <APPLAUSE> I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person or even one election, it was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted. We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them. <APPLAUSE> Now -- and let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years but all the time. So let's do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear; making our economy work for everyone not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams.
<CLINTON:> We've spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone -- for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. For everyone. <APPLAUSE> So now, our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will. I am so grateful to stand with all of you. I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. <APPLAUSE> It has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy representing Virginia in the Senate. <APPLAUSE> To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude. <APPLAUSE> We -- we thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world. And to Bill and Chelsea, Mark, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most -- even four-month-old Aidan who traveled with his mom. I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country. <APPLAUSE> You poured your hearts into this campaign. For some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns. Some of you, it was your first campaign. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted. <APPLAUSE> And to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook, even in secret, private Facebook sites... <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> ... I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward. <APPLAUSE> To everyone who sent in contributions as small at $5 and kept us going, thank you. Thank you from all of us. And to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have, as Tim said, spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I've had successes and I've had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too. This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it.<APPLAUSE>
<CLINTON:> It is -- it is worth it. <APPLAUSE> And so we need -- we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives. And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. <APPLAUSE> Now, I -- I know -- I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. <APPLAUSE> And -- and to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams. Finally... <APPLAUSE> Finally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American. And I still believe as deeply as I ever have that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us. <APPLAUSE> Because, you know -- you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that. You know, scripture tells us, ""Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap if we do not lose heart."" So my friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do. I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-07-22"">
<PENCE: (OFF-MIKE) to this country, who will make America great again. (APPLAUSE) I give you the next president of the United States of America, Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. We had an amazing convention. That was one of the best. I think it was one of the best ever. In terms -- in terms of enthusiasm, in terms of I think what it represents, getting our word out. Ivanka was incredible last night. She did an incredible job. <APPLAUSE> And so many of the speakers were so amazing and ground-setting. I mean, really ground-setting. We were -- it was just something very, very special. We're even getting good marks on television. Can you believe this? <APPLAUSE> Hard to believe. Oh, they'll change. Don't worry. <LAUGHTER> But it has been -- it has been just an incredible four days. I want to thank the people of Cleveland and the people of Ohio. <APPLAUSE> Because it's -- I mean, what -- what they've done. You know, we read two, three weeks ago, ""this is going to be horrible; we're going to have riots; we're going to have problems."" Everything was a problem, a problem. This was probably one of the most peaceful, one of the most beautiful, one of the most love-filled conventions in the history of conventions. <APPLAUSE> And when they talk about unity, I want to tell you, that was unity. That was unity. Right? I saw you last night. That was unity. That was amazing. And the party has just come together. The party has come together. And the few people that aren't there, it's OK. You know. You've got to understand. I ran as an outsider. I didn't want anybody. Now, I have guys like Mike Pence. I mean, this isn't supposed to happen. <APPLAUSE> See, now if I don't win, I'm going to blame Mike, right? We have to blame Mike. <LAUGHTER> But we want to thank a number of people because, in particular, and we're going to leave out some because that always happens and it's very sad. The set -- I'm a real estate guy -- I build buildings. I build things. I want to tell you, that was the most beautiful set I think I've ever seen, not only for conventions, but for anything. <APPLAUSE> And the folks that worked on that, especially the carpenters, the electricians. You know, we forget about -- we forget about this stuff. Those sheet-rockers were up there. They did a heck of a job. I said, ""You're going to wrap that sheet rock?"" And he said, ""Yeah, Mr. Trump, we just cut it."" I said, ""I know what you do, but you don't see it very much."" We have our chairman from New York I see right over there -- my man, my leader. Right? We're going to win New York. We're going to try and win New York. <APPLAUSE> You know, if we win New York, it's over. Right? It's over. Thank you, Chairman. I really appreciate it.
<TRUMP:> So, a few of the people. Harold Hamm is here. Where is Harold? He's around here -- look at Harold here. Oh, boy. You talk about money. Oy, yoy, yoy. You know, Barry Switzer, the great football coach, won a Super Bowl, won a national championship. And I guess he's Harold's best friend, or one of them. So he came up to my office and he's sitting there and says, ""You know Mr. Trump, Harold is one of the great energy tycoons, but more importantly from our standpoint, one of the people that really understands energy better than anybody else."" You know we hired these consultants, they don't know what they're doing. If they were any good, they'd be worth $10 billion, OK? But Harold is one of the really knowledgeable people in energy. And Barry Switzer -- and he's a tough cookie and a good guy, but a tough cookie. He said, ""You know Mr. Trump, that Harold Hamm, he's my friend, but these other companies they go out and they spend millions of dollars looking for oil. That guy takes a straw, puts in the ground and oil pours out of it."" That's the kind of a guy we want telling us about energy, right? <APPLAUSE> Harold, and you made a great speech the other night, great to have you. We want the real players right? We don't want the consultants, we don't want the guys that he hires, we want him. So, Harold, great that you're here, I didn't know you'd be here. I appreciate it. And your speech was terrific, by the way. We also have, and I think very important, Jeff Sessions, who may or may not be here, still but I want to tell you he was the first one. <APPLAUSE> Mike, he was right at the beginning. And he's so highly respected and honestly Ted Cruz has so much respect for Jeff Sessions, and everybody knew that Jeff Sessions was going to be with Ted Cruz during the campaign. And Jeff said, ""You know, I've never seen anything like what's happening. You've got a movement going on."" And he was really the first big, big player -- U.S. senator, highly respected by everybody, one of the really smart people and low key. I like that, everyone once and a while, you know that low key genius. <LAUGHTER> ""Well, Donald, I don't know if I'd do it that way, why don't you try doing it this way?"" I say that's genius. <LAUGHTER> Every once and a while we have people like that right? But Jeff Sessions was there right at the beginning, and it was a huge upset, because when Jeff came on, everybody thought he was going to just routinely be with Ted. And frankly he's never endorsed anybody before. You know, he's not an endorser. This is -- he's called a tough endorsement. And he went out and he endorsed me, and that was a fantastic thing. And he's been a great help ever since. So Jeff Sessions, I appreciate it. <APPLAUSE> Jeff Larson's around here someplace -- where's Jeff Larson? He's around here someplace. What a job Jeff did. Reince, of course, where's my superstar? <APPLAUSE> I think he's probably on a plane flying to our next meeting. This guy works so hard. You know I said yesterday in front of a small group, because we're raising money like it's crazy what's going on -- and you know the nice thing? First of all, I put in over $60 million. Last month, I think I put in $3.8 million. But we're raising money also for the Republican Party, which is very important. <APPLAUSE> And -- and the beautiful thing -- I can't guarantee these figures, but I heard yesterday alone was like $3.5 million from small donors. The average donation was just over $50. And we're raising tremendous amount of money from the small donors. To me, that's more important in a sense. I mean Harold can write his checks but Harold's only one vote, right? These other people give you $50, but they vote by the millions, that's what we want. To hell with Harold, right? <APPLAUSE> But -- but we have, you know, just tremendous numbers of people coming in, and we're really building up a war chest that's going to be great. And I'm continuing to fund my campaign, large portions of it. And in fact, I thought I gave $2 million last month, and they said ""No, you actually gave $3.8."" I said ""Oh."" It's always good when you don't even know what you gave, and it doesn't matter. <LAUGHTER> You know it's nice when they say you gave $3.8 instead of two, and I don't even get angry at anybody, right? <LAUGHTER> But I'm over $60 million, because I said I was going to fund the primaries. And I didn't know this was going to happen, so I guess we just keep going along, right? But I'll tell you, it's an honor, it's an honor. And I -- and I've said this, a lot of the television people have come up to me, and a lot of the -- actually, one very highly respected writer called up and I've told this story a few times, but I said -- he said, ""What you've done is incredible."" And this was actually in September. They called it the ""summer of Trump."" And he said, ""What you've done is incredible."" I said ""Nothing's incredible unless I win."" And I wasn't talking about the primaries. He said ""No, no, no. what you've done is incredible. It's been the summer of Trump, it's down in the history books, there's never been anything like it."" Bill O'Reilly said it's the greatest single political phenomena he's ever seen in his life. A couple of weeks ago, did you see that?<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Yeah. And Brit Hume said it, and I'm not so sure if Brit Hume likes me, but he said it. So -- but I like him. So what happened is they said that. I said no, no, no, you don't understand. I don't care. I don't do anything unless I win, and I'm not talking about the primaries. I mean, the whole thing -- because otherwise, what have we done? What have we done? Then I got a call from somebody else a month ago saying the same thing. But now, it was the summer of Trump. It was the autumn of Trump. It was the Christmas of Trump. It was everything. And it's really of you because it's a movement. What we have going is a movement. I was just on the cover of Time again this week. Time Magazine's like, eh, OK. <LAUGHTER> You know, I think I was on the cover of Time Magazine twice in my life and like six times in the last number of months. So you tell me, which is more important, real estate or politic, OK? That's -- that's the way -- is that true, Harold? Because I have six for politics and I have two for real estate or whatever they put me on for. But it's been -- it's been amazing. But I said, look, it really to me matters. They said no, no, no, believe me, what you've done is in the history books. There's never been anything like it. Then I won the primaries. They said the same thing. This is crazy, now you're really in the history -- I said no, it doesn't matter. unless we beat Hillary Clinton, and I mean beat her badly. <APPLAUSE> I will consider it -- and I shouldn't say this, because you know what? If it doesn't work out, I could say, well, I did a good job. So I'm hurting myself by saying this. If I don't win, meaning that final stage, beat 17 people -- because actually 17 including, but it was actually 17 because there was one that we don't even talk about who joined who left very quickly. One statement, he was gone, OK? <LAUGHTER> And then don't forget Hillary had a couple of guys who dropped out and Bernie was tough, Bernie was tough. We're going to get a lot of the Bernie voters, by the way. <APPLAUSE> Because they didn't treat Bernie right. They didn't treat him right. I mean, I don't know Bernie. I don't -- you know, I don't know him, I've never met him. But they didn't treat him right, honestly. And what happened -- he ran a very, very good campaign. And Hillary's people just swamped him. You're looking at Debra Wasserman Schultz. I'll take <inaudible> Reince over her any day in terms of competence. Forget it. <APPLAUSE> Not for being nice or any of those things. Who cares? I will take Reince in terms of competence over her -- believe me -- any day. Any day. You see what she's done to that party. So I will tell you that I think we're going to get a lot of his voters because of the trade issue. Because they understand, but because of the trade issue. I think we're going to get a lot of their voters. So I have to thank Reince. I want to thank Steve King. Where's Steve King? That's our local -- where's Steve? Where? Thank you, Steve. I want to thank some of our security guys. First of all, the Secret Service is unbelievable. Unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> They've been hit a little bit over the last couple of years. Let me tell you, these guys are fantastic. I'm the best thing that ever happened to the Secret Service. <LAUGHTER> Because I go around, Mark and all these guys, I go around saying how great they are. They are great. These are great, great people, OK? <APPLAUSE> So I want to thank the Secret Service. I want to thank the police of Cleveland, the Cleveland Police Department. The mayor, I want to thank. I want to thank your police chief. He is amazing. I don't know if he's here. But boy, he has done some job working -- working with all of the folks from law enforcement. And you heard last night, we're going to be protecting the law enforcement. They are doing some job. So we're going to be protecting them. I want to thank Eddie Dick <ph>. Where's Eddie? Is Eddied here? I want to thank Kevin Schroeder <ph>, Keith Schiller. Become famous. He's becoming more famous than me. I have to thank -- and again, your police chief has done a fantastic job in Cleveland, done a fantastic -- and we have <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> In terms of some of the folks, David Gilbert. Where's David? David around some place? Joe Roman <ph>, Chris Conner <ph>, Chris Kelly. These people are all here. Don't bother, you don't have to come up and speak. <LAUGHTER> Beth Mooney <ph>. Where's Brian Jack? Brian Jack. Boy, Brian. Brian. What a job you did, Brian.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> OK. That's all. Now, you can leave, go to the next location, Brian. <APPLAUSE> Go to the next location. Hillary's trying the to pick her vice president as fast as possible, because she wants to take away a little of the success that we had at this convention. This convention has been a success. You know, people, if you turn on television, you turn on some of the dishonest media, you'll see that oh, wow, this happened and that happened. What happened? You know, somebody got booed the hell out of a place by thousands and thousands of people. <APPLAUSE> There wasn't one person in the room -- not one. And then they said, ""There may not be unity."" Unity? There wasn't one person in the room who was -- including the Texas delegation, right? Honestly, he may have ruined his political career. I feel so badly. I feel so badly. <APPLAUSE> And, you know, he'll come and endorse over the next little while, he'll come and endorse, because he has no choice. But I don't want his endorsement. What difference does it make? I don't want his endorsement. I have such great endorse -- I don't want his endorsement. Just -- Ted, stay home, relax, enjoy yourself. <LAUGHTER> Just a couple of things. I knew his speech, they gave me his speech, I saw exactly what his speech was, because when you go up to speak, you have to give your speech, you know? We don't want surprises, right? So they gave it. They came to me and said ""It's a boring speech, Mr. Trump. Nothing good, nothing bad. He congratulates you on the victory, and here's the speech."" Well, he got up, and of the first two sentences, he added a sentence. In other words, he got up and he added a sentence, which could have been viewed as a nasty thing in terms of what he said, because he was implying something which is wrong, but that's OK. So he took his speech -- and you're bound by the speech, just like you're bound by the pledge, right? <APPLAUSE> You're bound by the pledge. So Ted Cruz took his speech that was done, was on the teleprompter, said hello, then made a statement that wasn't on the speech, and then went back to his speech. See, to me, that's dishonorable. To me, not signing a pledge is dishonorable. OK? It's dishonorable, but not a nice thing to do. And I talk this way, because we're all together. We created one of the most successful conventions in the history of conventions. <APPLAUSE> And the television ratings for this convention were through the roof. I get a kick out of CNN. ""I don't know if this is a successful convention. I don't know."" In the meantime, all they talk about is Trump and the convention, are right? And I have to tell you, Melania did a great job. What a great speech. What a great speech. <APPLAUSE> What a great speech. And the presentation is still being talked about. What a beautiful speech. Ivanka last night, unbelievable, unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> Unbelievable, to have that kind of an introduction. And Tiffany, who's never done it, the biggest group she's ever been in front of is probably 22 people in a classroom. <LAUGHTER> Tiffany was amazing. And Eric and Don. <APPLAUSE> I just don't want them running for political office, because somebody's got to stay behind and run the business. I mean, you know, we can't go crazy. <LAUGHTER> But I get a kick, because the ratings on television are through the roof. And nobody's going to watch -- look, I'll -- this has nothing to do with politics, but maybe it has a little to do. Nobody's going to watch this next convention coming. Who the -- who's going to -- I'm going to have a hard time watching her final speech. Number one, I know her too well. Number two, boring, it's boring. <LAUGHTER> Very boring. Oh, how about that final speech? And our final speech, our final speech. <APPLAUSE> Now, it wasn't my fault, but I think it went like an hour and 25 minutes, and the networks didn't know what to do, because they had all of their programming, big programming -- the local news is a very big factor on television. You never, ever move your local news. They all moved it. <LAUGHTER> They said, the heck with the local news, Mike, they said we're moving it. And Kimmel and Fallon and the shows, they all went back a long way, because they weren't going to miss this convention. I love that, you know? I love it. I knew I said, oh, wow, I'm supposed to be off. Let's keep going, but it wasn't my fault. <LAUGHTER> What happened -- what happened was the applause was so long and so crazy. <APPLAUSE> It really was. I mean, if you look, the speech was fine, but the applause were longer than the speech.
<TRUMP:> So it was -- it was amazing. There was great love in that room. Honestly, that was all about unity. And we may be missing a couple of people. We may be missing just a couple of people. Two other things, two other things, just to finish with Ted. Because I like Ted. He's fine. Again, I don't want his endorsement. If he gives it, I will not accept it. Just so you understand. If he gives it, I will -- I will not accept. It won't matter. Honestly, he should have done it because nobody cares. And he would have been in better shape for four years from now if he's going to -- I don't think -- I don't see him winning anyway, frankly. But if he did, it's fine. Although maybe I'll set up a super-PAC if he decides to run. <APPLAUSE> Are you allowed to set up a super-PAC, Mike, if you are the president, to fight somebody? But -- but there were two things that he said yesterday were lies. Ready? I didn't start anything with the wife. A PAC, which he's very friendly with, released a cover story on my wife, who was a tremendously successful and elegant model. And she was on the cover of GQ magazine. I think it was GQ, right? GQ magazine is not exactly Penthouse. But she was on the cover of GQ magazine, an artsy picture. But you know, she was a model, really successful. She didn't need to marry me. She was making a lot of money, believe me. <LAUGHTER> In fact, I had to work hard to get her to marry me. It wasn't that easy. <LAUGHTER> It's true. <APPLAUSE> It's so true. You think I'm kidding. So -- so they released this picture which was, you know, to the people of the state of Utah. I love Utah. I love the people of Utah. But that's not where you want to necessarily send a risque picture. Everybody in Utah got a picture. And I don't think they showed that it was GQ. I don't even think they showed. They took the GQ off. They just had -- they cut all the stuff out so they didn't see it was a magazine cover from, you know, a reasonably respected magazine. And it was Melania Trump. Now, and I'm saying this just to clear it up, because that's a -- ""he took <inaudible>."" I didn't do anything. Then when I saw somebody tweeted a picture of Melania, and a picture of Heidi, who I think, by the way, is a very nice woman and a very beautiful woman. I have to tell you, I think Heidi Cruz is a great person. I think it's the best thing he'd got going, and his kids, if you want to know the truth. <APPLAUSE> In a certain way, although he's got good intellect, but he doesn't know how to use it. And he was a good debater, but he didn't do well in the debates against me, according to every poll. I mean, every poll, you know, he's this great debater, except he lost in every single poll and every single debate. So that takes care of the Heidi thing. Because Heidi's a terrific woman, but they sent out -- now, he said, ""That was a PAC; we had nothing to do."" Folks, a lot of us are political people, right? We're not babies. His people were on the PAC. So he said, ""We had nothing to do; we had..."" Now, probably you could trace it down with e-mails, but they're pretty smart. They don't even send -- probably just phone calls. But look, it was a PAC with many of his friends. It was a Cruz super-PAC. I think he even said, ""Well, it wasn't really meant for us."" It was a Cruz PAC. It was his people. OK, so they sent out the first picture. Please remember that. Number two, his father. I don't know his father. I met him once. I think he's a lovely guy. I think he's a lovely guy. All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the National Enquirer there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast. Now, Ted never denied that it was his father. Instead, he said, ""Donald Trump"" -- I had nothing to do with it. This was a magazine that, frankly, in many respects, should be very respected. They got O.J. They got Edwards. I mean, if that was the New York Times, they would have gotten Pulitzer Prizes for their reporting. I've always said, why didn't the National Enquirer get the Pulitzer Prize for Edwards and O.J. Simpson and all of these things? But anyway, so they have a picture, an old picture, having breakfast with Lee Harvey Oswald. Now, nothing -- I'm not saying anything. They said -- and here's how the press takes that story. So this had nothing to do with me, except I might have pointed it out, but it had nothing to do with me. I have no control over anything. I might have pointed it out. But they never denied. Did anybody ever deny that it was the father? They're not saying, ""Oh, that wasn't really my father."" It's a little hard to do, because it looks like him.<LAUGHTER>
<TRUMP:> So, here's the story. The press takes that, and they say, ""Donald Trump and his conspiracy theories; he went out and said his father was with Lee Harvey Oswald, and he assassinated the president."" What did I do? So two things. Those were the two points. So in those two points, he said about the endorsement -- and I just had it cleared up. I think I'm doing the right thing in doing it, but I have to do it. Number one, the Heidi thing you understand now. Number two, I know nothing about his father. I know nothing about Lee Harvey Oswald. But there was a picture on the front page of the National Inquirer, which does have credibility, and they're not going to do pictures like that because they get sued for a lot of money if things are wrong, OK, a lot of money. And there was a picture. And that's the only thing I know. So now, they use the two things as the reason he won't support. Let me tell you something. We, if for no other reason, if people really dislike me, and I don't think they do any more after the four days. Hey look, if I have kids that like me that much, how bad can I be, right, right? <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> And they love their daddy. I was a good father. But I have smart children and good children. And I'm getting a lot of credit. I think they were the star of the convention. Mike, I think they saved us. I think they saved us, Mike. But no, my children were really -- and they're saying, people are saying that, they were the star -- the real stars of the convention. Everyone of them -- they were -- I was so proud of them. I mean, it was such a great thing. But to finish, this was an amazing period of time. This was an amazing convention. I just heard a number -- is Dan Scavino there? Come up, Dan, for a second. I just -- Dan Scavino. You might have seen him on Twitter and Facebook. You know what he is? He's a Facebook, Twitter junky. This guy -- that was the first time I've seen him look up in seven months. He's always looking down. <LAUGHTER> Nobody knows Facebook and Twitter and that stuff better than Dan. Why don't you give just a quick report because I hear the numbers are astronomical. Where do you hear these -- you know, we're dealing in a modern age. I hate to do this. A lot of people saying what's Facebook, what's -- unfortunately, we're dealing in a modern age. How about giving a quick -- you want to hear this? Wait until you hear the numbers. You won't even believe them. Go ahead.
<SCAVINO: Thank you, President Trump. This -- this is... (APPLAUSE) I've got to -- I have to tell you, #trumptrain. Is everybody out there? The Trump train is all here, right? (APPLAUSE) This is surreal for everybody that's part of the campaign. Twitter last night exploded. Facebook exploded. Instagram exploded. Did everybody see the videos on Mr. Trump's Twitter account, Instagram account, Facebook account? I mean, tens of millions of views. We had over 85 million views on just those videos in a four to five-day period, all right? Almost half a million new followers on Facebook. Mr. Trump hit 10 million followers on Twitter.>
<TRUMP:> Ten million. <APPLAUSE>
<SCAVINO: This -- this will never be done again. It's impossible to be done again with this man right here. It's absolutely impossible with his platforms. A total of 22.5 million followers between Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, 22.5 million. (APPLAUSE) I don't know how you do this every day. This is insane. Impressions on Twitter per month, over one billion impressions on Twitter. (APPLAUSE) And similar, the numbers are going to come out for Facebook, they're going to be probably in the billions. It's absolutely unheard of. So when Mr. Trump wants to get a message out, we get those videos out and things aren't necessarily working out with CNN or somebody, we can put it on his platform and get more views just on one of those social media accounts that Mr. Trump has, which is @realDonaldtrump on Twitter, Donald J. Trump on Facebook, RealDonaldTrump on Instagram. And our next vice president of the United States is @mike_pence, OK? So please follow him as well. He has a governor account, but he's still the governor of Indiana so let's just try and follow him there, all right, give him some engagements. We're going to be pushing out a lot of messages for the campaign. There's a lot of people behind me. It's not only me; Brad Parscale, Justin McConney. This is -- there's a whole team. So we -- we love you. This is absolutely awesome to come out and talk to the #trumptrain. Let's make America great again. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> So one of my really good choices in life, although I'll confirm that in about three and a half months from now, but I believe truly it will be one of my really great decisions is picking Mike Pence to run along with me and to run for you <ph>. And so I'd like to ask Governor Pence from the great state of Indiana, and we love Indiana and Bobby Knight, who I love and Lou Holtz and you're wonderful -- you know, Gene from Purdue -- we have them all -- and Digger. We've got a lot of coaches out there. But these guys are great people and they love Mike and maybe Mike can say a few words. Thank you. <APPLAUSE>
<PENCE: We are so humbled and so grateful. Grateful to all of you, the volunteers, the people wearing the blue shirts, the people that brought about the most exciting political convention of my entire lifetime. Thank you for your extraordinary work, your tireless hours. To all of those that did the work, that did the setup, that are doing the tear down now, thank you so much. Thank you so much for creating a place where we could celebrate the kind of leadership that America is embracing more and more every hour as we move toward the November election. But I just -- I just wanted to express a word of appreciation to all of you. All of you who came here, all of you who came alongside this good man and his family from early on in this campaign. We're -- we're so excited to be a part of this team. My wonderful wife, Karen Pence, is with us today and we are hitting the campaign trail together. (APPLAUSE) And I can just tell you -- I can just tell you having spent time with this man and his family, having seen his ability to connect and speak for the American people, I say with absolute confidence if we work with all of our hearts for every day between now and election day, we will make Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States of America and we will make America great again. Thank you and God bless you and let's go get it done. (APPLAUSE) >
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Just one thing I wanted to leave you with: Supreme Court justices. <APPLAUSE> No matter how much you like or dislike, no matter what your feelings, whether you're the governor of Ohio, whether you're a senator from Texas or any of the other people that I beat so easily and so badly, you have no choice, you've got to go for Trump. Supreme Court justices. If Hillary Clinton gets it, she is going to replace -- and last night I called him our beloved Justice Scalia, he was great. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to get somebody as close to him and his views and philosophy as possible. Conservative, all the things you want, the things we stand for as a party. And I promise you that, and that's why I issued 11 names because being an outsider, they said oh, well we don't know, supposing you put up liberal judges. I say I have an idea, it's never been done before, you know we have a lot of ideas that people don't normally have, right? I said I have an idea. In order to -- because I really just have no problem. They didn't know if they believed me, well we don't know what happens if we elect him and then he puts up liberal judges. By the way, our conservative Republican presidents haven't done so well with the judges, have they? OK. I mean, we have Obamacare, should have been knocked out twice because of an appointment. <APPLAUSE> So we'll do better, we'll do much better. That's why I put out a list of 11 judges. But no matter what you think of Donald Trump, as a Republican, if that's what your philosophy is, if you're a great, great believer in the Constitution, you have no choice. Hate to say it. Whether you're a hater or a lover, and by the way, last night I don't think there was one hater in that room. And that was packed.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> That was packed. There were no seats and those seats were selling for a lot of money on eBay. They were going for big numbers. In fact, I was thinking about taking 10 or 12 tickets and saying, ""Let's go."" But they were selling for a lot of money. And it was amazing. So, just remember, Supreme Court justices. I want to finish by this -- we've had some incredible support, because when I started everyone said, you know, some of these pundits that now say, ""Oh, well, you can't do that, you can't"" -- these were the same people that say, ""well, if he runs -- but he won't run."" I ran. Then they said, ""Oh,"" then they go, ""But he won't win."" Then I started off at 6 percent, which is pretty high because I was only there about two days. People forgot. So that was only two days, I didn't get the full backing. Then it went to like 12, and then to 18. And every week they said, ""Well, that's his ceiling. And he can't do more than that."" So we go from six -- right? These -- I saw them in the audience, those two. So we go from six, to 12 to 18 and every week they go, ""Well, that's the ceiling."" Charles Krauthammer, ""They will not run, he will not run. And if he runs, he will just be doing it for fun."" This is not fun. This is a lot of work. OK. This is a lot of work, folks. I didn't need this. This wasn't in exactly the schedule. But I saw how badly our country is doing and how easy it will be to bring back. Trade deals alone will make an impact like you won't believe. Money will come in. Jobs will come in. And then you look at the military where it's so depleted, but we're taking care of other nations. And I want to continue to take care of other nations, there are a lot of good things about that, but they have to pay us. They have to pay us. <APPLAUSE> You know, I remember years ago, and I've always said, ""Wow, I never quite understood it, "" because they said, ""The United States spends ten times the money on its military than anybody else in the world."" I said -- I said, ""Well, China has a big military, all these places. That's surprising."" But, you know, I was building buildings and things, I never really gave it too much thought. And then I realized, I remember -- I always remember, we spend so much more than anybody else. I said, how can that be? We're protecting everybody in the world. I mean, we're protecting all these nations, and these are rich nations and they're great nations. Japan, they send their cars, they make a fortune, and then they don't pay us the amount that it costs. I don't want to make a profit. I want costs, pay us what it costs. Maybe we can't get it. And if we can't -- see, you have to be prepared to walk. You have to. If you're not prepared to walk. Hillary Clinton came out when she heard what I said about Japan. Japan is a very rich nation. Those cars are flowing in. They're rich because of us, if you think about it. OK. Those cars -- you go to Los Angeles, you see these massive ships. It looks like NASCAR. By the way, thank you Brian France, owner of NASCAR. He endorsed Donald Trump. I love NASCAR! Richard Petty endorsed me. All -- a lot of the great drivers endorsed me. King Richard. But they -- it's like -- it's like these guys driving -- it's like Richard Petty driving -- they're coming out of the boats, these massive ships. And they don't pay us. And then the general gets up and the general says, ""Mr. Trump is wrong, doesn't he understand that Japan pays us 50 percent of the cost of defending them?"" Oh, great. They say, ""Mr. Trump, could we have a comment?"" I said, ""Yeah, why aren't they paying 100 percent,"" Right? And Germany and South Korea, we have 28,000 soldiers. And think of this one, Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia wouldn't be there for one week if we pulled out. They have nothing but money. Nothing but money. They have so much money, they -- they don't know what to do with it, OK. They don't know what to do with it. Who's -- who is making our deals for us? One deal like that has a massive impact on our budgets, on our economics as a country. We're up to $19 trillion. We're very soon going to be $21 trillion. Trillion. Nobody even knows what -- if I could take -- I could take the great Harold Hamm, I could say, ""Tell me what a trillion dollars is?"" Although, he's worth almost a trillion, so he may know. He may know. <LAUGHTER> But, you know, honestly, most people don't even know what the hell it -- it's so much. They even know. They wouldn't know how to define it. So here's the story. We are going to do something really special, and our message caught on. When I started this, we had all these pundits saying, it won't happen. And I had a little staff -- Corey Lewandowski was great. I have to tell you.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And he's been very loyal and he's been on CNN, and he's really been fighting for me, which is very nice. And I -- I respect that a lot. <APPLAUSE> Hope Hicks. Where's Hope? Come here, Hope. Come here, Hope. Get up here, Hope. Hope Hicks, the legendary Hope Hicks. Come on up here, Hope. Come. Come. Come. She's shy. Get her up here. Come on, Hope. Come on, Hope. We had a very small, but tough team. We had a small -- here's Hope Hicks. They're not going to lift you over that barricade probably. Look at her. She's very shy. She's actually -- she's a very shy person, but she's a great person. She's done an amazing job. And we had a staff of between George -- where's our George? Come on over here. Come on. Fellows, get over here. Just stand over here someplace. Get up. Get up on the dais. Come on. I'd get Hope up, but she can't get through the Secret Service people there. And what happened -- so we had a small staff. And I got criticized for it. They'd say, ""So and so"" -- I won't use names because I don't want to embarrass anybody -- ""so and so has spent many times what Trump has spent and has a much bigger staff,"" and then we win. I don't get any credit. You're supposed to get credit if you have smaller staff, less payroll, and you win. But in politics, you don't get credit. So anyway, so I want to thank my entire group. Then we beefed it up because we're really now in the final stretch -- three-and-a-half months. And Paul Manafort has done an amazing job. He's here someplace. Where's Paul? <APPLAUSE> Paul Manafort -- oh, good. You made it. Paul Manafort has done a fantastic <inaudible>. And all of Paul's people Paul brought on the staff. And we really do. We have a great staff of talented people, a great staff. And most of them are right here. And John and everybody -- my man right here; and Michael. You have to be -- Michael, come on up, Michael. Get up here, Michael. Come on. Get a little TV time. Look at him. <LAUGHTER> I don't know <inaudible> hired for Hollywood. I tend to doubt it, but you never know. Come on up, Rick. So we have a great group of people. And we have a group of people that really wants to win, and I think knows how to win. And we've all sort of been winning all our lives. This group of people in front of me, I know so many of you, we've been winning all our lives. We've got exactly three months and three weeks. I am going to be working so hard. I'm not going to, like last time where they disappeared for the last month-and-a-half. What happened? Where is everybody? What happened? And give Obama credit. He was on every television show. He was all over the place. We're not going to disappear. So we have a really great chance of taking our country back, of change, and of getting great Supreme Court justices. <APPLAUSE> So, I want to thank everybody. I love you folks. This has been such an incredible movement. I love you. I know so many of you. We're going to go all the way. And I'll tell you what, when we get there, we will indeed make America great again. I love you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. <APPLAUSE>","The Grammar Lab"

Mike Pence, Republican vice presidential candidate, hold a townhall meeting"">
<date:""2016-07-25"">
<PENCE: Hello, Virginia. (APPLAUSE) What a joy to be with you today. My fellow Americans, we are 105 days away from a great victory for the American people when we elect Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) You know, this -- this last seven-and-a-half years has been characterized by failed policies at home and abroad. The policies of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have weakened America's place in the world and stifled our nation's economy. And we're ready for change. (APPLAUSE) We are ready to put a fighter, a builder, a patriot in the Oval Office of the United States of America. We're ready for Donald Trump... (APPLAUSE) ... right here in Virginia. And Donald Trump will put the American people first. He'll put the safety and security of the American people first and foremost in his mind.(APPLAUSE)>
<PENCE: With terrorist attacks abroad, and inspired terrorist attacks at home, the American people want a president who will put law and order first at home and confront our enemies abroad. And that man is Donald Trump. Another Clinton Presidency will just continue the failed policies of the recent past. Remember, remember it was Hillary Clinton who squandered the gains that we had made at the close of our presence in Iraq. A failure in judgment that set ISIS on the loose. It was Hillary Clinton who supported the disastrous agreement with the radical Mullahs in Iran. They got $150 billion and we got a handshake. And it was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi. And then said what difference at this point does it make? After four Americans fell. Well to all of those who wear the uniform here in Virginia, to all of our veterans who are with us today and as the proud father of a United States Marine let me say from my heart, anyone who did that, anyone who said that, should be disqualified from ever serving as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States of America. You know Donald Trump understands the frustrations and the aspirations of the American people, like no other American leader in my lifetime, since our 40th President, Ronald Reagan. The people of Virginia knew Ronald Reagan's quality, they knew his character. But they understood that he had a heart that resonated with the heart of the American people. And I can tell you having been around this good man and his family; he has a heart for the American people. That comes I think from a lifetime of building and being around men and women who build. This is a man who has built skyscrapers and built skylines but he's built them shoulder-to-shoulder with the people that did the work. And he understands the American people. Donald Trump knows. He knows the American people are tired. We're tired of being told, we're tired of being told this is as good as it gets. We're tired of hearing politicians in both political parties tell us that they'll get to these big problems we're facing tomorrow, while they pile mountain ranges of debt on our children and grandchildren. And as Ronald Reagan said so eloquently so many years ago, we're tired of being told that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capital can plan our lives better for us than we can plan them for ourselves.>
<PENCE: Donald Trump gets it. And we must decide here and now, this man will be our next president and Hillary Clinton will never be president of the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) Donald Trump has never forgotten the men and women in this country who work with their hands, who grow the food, who build our roads and bridges, who tend to our sick, teach our kids, protect our lives, and bear the burden and pay the freight of all the government with (ph) the American elites are placing on us every day. Donald Trump understands the boundless potential of the American people. And he knows that with more freedom and less government, and a stronger America abroad, we will make America great again. (APPLAUSE) You know, the other side just has more of the same. That's their agenda; that's what you're going to hear on television this week. More the same, more government, more taxes, more regulation. And they're going to us this is the best we can do. Well it's nowhere near the best we can do; it's just the best they can do. (APPLAUSE) Donald Trump knows that by lessening the tax burden on working Americans by cutting red tape and regulations by getting (ph) runaway Federal spending under control by having better deals with foreign countries. That will be a win for American and a win for our economy. And Donald Trump knows that the war on coal must be brought to an end. We don't -- we don't need a president who promises to put quote a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. We need a president who supports an all-of-the-above energy strategy. And we need a president who digs coal. So our choice is clear in this election, my fellow Americans, citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It's change versus the status quo. And I want to promise you, when we elect Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States... (APPLAUSE) I want to promise you when we elect this good man as our next great president, the change will be huge. (APPLAUSE) So, for the sake of our soldiers who deserve a Commander in Chief who will have their back... (APPLAUSE) ... for the sake of hard-working Americans and businesses who deserve a president who will get Washington, D.C. off their back... (APPLAUSE) ... and for the sake of a Supreme Court that will respect our God-given liberties, the sanctity of life, and our Second Amendment, I give you the man that we must ensure is the next president of the United States of America, Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everybody. <APPLAUSE> Who <inaudible>? <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody <inaudible>. This is a great honor, great state. I have a lot of property <inaudible> people in Virginia. Pay a lot of checks -- bing -- every night, every day; a lot of great success I've had in Virginia over the years. And we have just phenomenal stuff in Loudoun County, as you know, and we have down in Charlottesville and some other stuff. Tremendous, tremendous, beautiful property. Charlottesville is right next to Thomas Jefferson. <APPLAUSE> He was an architect. You know, he had great taste. He had great taste. He understood that's some of the most beautiful land I've ever seen. So I love Virginia. And we are going to win Virginia. <APPLAUSE> We're going to win Virginia. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to go over some of the statistics when Tim Kaine was governor. They're not pretty. They're not pretty. But before I do, I just want to say that Debbie Wasserman Schultz... <BOOING> I always knew she was highly overrated. I always knew. <APPLAUSE> Not good. But she just got fired. They said, ""Debbie, you're fired; get out, Debbie -- out, boom."" Boy, they were <inaudible>. How about that for disloyalty, though, in terms of Hillary Clinton? In all fairness, because Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary Clinton and <inaudible> politicians, folks, other than Mike Pence, of course. He's great. But these politicians -- hey, look, look, look. So, there's no loyalty there. Right? There's no loyalty. None whatsoever. It gets a little heat and they fire her -- ""get outta here, get outta here."" She knew what was going on. Hillary Clinton knew what was going on. She knew everything that was going on. She knew it's a rigged system that Bernie Sanders never had a chance. OK? He never had a chance. And if you look at it, look what's going on, they're having a lot of people marching now, and a lot of those people are going to vote for us. I'll tell you right now. <APPLAUSE> A lot of them. And not even because they like me or they don't like me. Although I have to say, have you seen the polls that just came out? <APPLAUSE> Right? We had, like, the biggest bounce that anyone can remember. They said, ""Well, if he gets out of the convention with no bounce, that will be a success."" Did we have nine points or something? Ten points? <APPLAUSE> We're leading. We're actually leading in the polls. <APPLAUSE> And the CNN poll was so good, I may have to start liking them again. And I don't <inaudible>. <LAUGHTER> No, they treat me unfairly. But you know what's more important? The poll. But you know, the big poll, the big poll, that's November 8th. That's the poll we care about, right?<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> But look how disloyal crooked Hillary Clinton was to somebody that put her life on the line. I mean, she -- what she did in order to take advantage of Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, what she did in order to make sure that the system, the rigged system stays intact and Hillary gets it, and then you see the e-mails. Can you imagine, they talk about religion. They talk about religion. Can you imagine if that was my e-mail? I'd right now be on the front page of every newspaper. It would be horrible. And they're trying to play it down. Well that wasn't so bad. That wasn't so bad. But could you imagine, seriously. There's such a different standard. So here's the story. Here's the story. So Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary. And Hillary threw her under a bus and it didn't take her more than five minutes to make that decision. Man, I don't want her covering my back, I'll tell you right now. It's true. It's true. Now the other thing I'm surprised at, you know it's nice when you're not reading speeches. Isn't it? Really? Because I can talk about current events. This stuff happened 10 minutes ago. You know if you're reading speeches, I see these guys. I dealt with a lot of them. I've actually been a very political person all my life. I've always been on the other side. But now for 14 months I've been doing this. And I like this side in a certain way better because we can do things better. They used to love me when I was just a contributor. I'd give millions of dollars. I was a contributor. I know, I like this better. I like being non-establishment better. But with Bernie, when you look at what happened, the thing that surprises me most is how he folded. He folded. I thought he was really hanging out tough, tough, tough. Then they find these horrible e-mails talking about his religion and is he Jewish and is he an atheist and what and that's not going to play well. Man that's rough. And that's not as bad as some of the other ones. And I said there's no way that Bernie Sanders shows up to make a speech. There's no way that he can ever endorse Crooked Hillary Clinton anymore right? There's no way. And today I see him trying to make the case. And his own people are out there booing. OK? They're out there booing. So it's pretty bad. Then I'll tell you, Hillary Clinton, I've been saying this for a long time, and I got it from Bernie Sanders. He said she suffers from bad judgment. Right? Bad judgment. She suffers from very bad judgment. Her instincts are bad, they're no good. Her instincts are defective. Her instincts are defective. But she's got, she's low energy. She actually is low energy. She'll go home, she'll take a nap for 4 or 5 hours, then she'll come back. No naps for Trump! No naps. I don't take naps. We don't have time. We don't have time. You ever see Hillary where she comes out and she'll read a teleprompter for a little while and then she'll go home; you don't see her for 3, 4 days. And then she comes back. And then they used to, I remember in Iowa they put like 3 or 4 people, really nice people in there sitting around a little table. And everyone's saying well I'd like to ask her a question, no, no, no, you're too tough. This is what we have. How do you think ISIS is going to react <ph>? I don't think so right? I don't think so. Not going to be good. No. We have tough enemies out there. We have tough, mean, vicious, horrible, horrible people. These are horrible, horrible human beings. We need toughness folks. It's about time. We need strength. We need toughness. We need smarts. We need warmth. We need compassion. We need everything. We need everything. But we don't need somebody that goes home and takes naps. We don't need naps.
<TRUMP:> But what did surprise me was that Bernie was so soft on this. I really -- I was amazed, because I watched his speech, you know -- ""We must vote for Hillary Clinton."" I mean, the hatred he's got, why would he do that? He looks better if he didn't do it, to me. Hey, what do I have to do with it? I don't care. Whatever he wants to do. But could you imagine if what's taking place now with the Democrats took place in Cleveland? And by the way, I have to tell you, Cleveland did an amazing job. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you, Cleveland. What a job. <APPLAUSE> I spoke to the police Chief Calvin -- did a phenomenal job up there, but what we had -- and the Secret Service, working with the Secret Service. What a job they did. But Cleveland's a beautiful place. I mean, really I was so happy. We had no problems. They were trying to show -- I know they showed this one square. It was this big square and they had a few people. They bring the cameras in close, you know, really close, because they don't want to show all the beautiful grass, you know, with no people on it. And you know why? I'll tell you why, because people like our message. People like our message. They really like it. And if you look at Philadelphia -- I went to school in Philadelphia. I love Philadelphia. If you look at Philadelphia, what they're going through right now, it looks like a lot of people. It's 100 degrees there. And speaking of that, by the way, I don't know if you saw it. Did you know I went to the other room? So you have a second room, and then outside you have over 1,000 people. And it's 104 degrees out. No, think of it. And the first time I ever did it. I said, ""Let's go -- let's go to the second room first."" Right? That's the ante-room. But let's go because it's the overflow room. I said -- so I went in there. We surprised them. We were nice. But you know, we love these people. But you know what I also like? I don't have to do it later. <APPLAUSE> And outside, we have a lot of people. And I wish they'd let them in. The Fire Department won't let them in because of a fire regulation, which is very sad because they're outside. It's -- we have speakers out there. I think the speakers are burning up, folks. It is hot. I wish the fire marshal -- where's the fire marshal? Is he around here? Come on, fire marshal. If they could get in, fire marshal -- you know, you have doors that go right out to the outside. I promise there's nothing, like you don't have a problem. I feel badly. We have those people -- we have people standing outside. You could get a few more people inside. If they could, let them in. So, that's the way a builder would talk. OK? That's the way a builder... <APPLAUSE> So you had the firing of the head of the DNC, and that was a vicious firing. A lot of things happened. You had her firing. Hillary Clinton's total disloyalty was at play. It really was. People don't say that. They won't say that in the media. Oh, if I did something with Reince, can you imagine if I fired Reince? I wouldn't do that because Reince has done such a great job -- Reince Priebus. What a job he has done. <APPLAUSE> And I always used to say, for months now I've been saying, ""I'll take Reince over Debbie."" And everyone said, ""Oh, but Debbie's a super star."" I said, ""So is Reince,"" and then it turned out that Debbie flamed out and she's gone. But the disloyalty was incredible. And I really mean that. Because honestly, whether you like her or not, she worked very hard to rig the system so that Hillary got in. It's true, right? It's true. No, it's true. She worked very, very hard to rig the system. Little did she know that China, Russia, one of our many, many friends came in and hacked the hell out of us. Can you imagine? Can you imagine what they're hacking? I guarantee we'll find the 33,000 e-mails.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Why did Hillary get rid of her middle name? Hillary? No, but why did she get rid of it? Hillary rotten Clinton. Rotten Clinton. Hillary rotten Clinton, right? Maybe that's why. It's too close. No, no. It's too close. It's too close. You think Mike Pence would say this? I don't think so. By the way, did I do a good job with Mike Pence? OK. <APPLAUSE> Him and his family. What a high-quality person. You know, you have to vet people, right? And we vetted Mike and they came back, and these are killers. And they came back with many pages on certain people, OK? Many pages. I -- I'd like to write a book. <LAUGHTER> Many, many pages. With Mike, they came back with like nothing. He's like the most perfect human being, this guy. I said, ""Mike, did you ever do anything wrong in your whole life?"" ""No, I don't think so."" <LAUGHTER> He is -- where is he? He's the best guy. That guy is great. I love this guy. I love him. <APPLAUSE> I love him. But you know what I really like about Mike? So listen to this. To me, a very important thing is her bad judgment. Now, whether you like her choice, Tim Kaine -- nobody even knows who he is. No. <BOOING> He's done a terrible job for Virginia. I assumed -- they said he picked a -- you know, he got picked because of Virginia, because Virginia is very important and I'm doing very well here. Hey. Hey, I'm employing a lot of people here and they don't employ anybody. I spent a lot of money in Potomac Falls, Sterling, that area. I mean, I spent a lot of money. We have great, great things happening. Next year, we have the senior PGA championship coming. Thousands and thousands of people will come into Virginia and spend a lot of money. Thank you. I love you too, darling. But... <APPLAUSE> But just think of it. So Hillary Clinton has -- almost 50 percent of the people want a progressive. OK. We don't have to like that, but that's OK. That's where they are. They want to give everything away and raise your taxes. That's what happens. No, no. She will have a tax raise. By the way, I have the largest tax cut of anybody running for office, Republican or Democrat. OK? <APPLAUSE> But Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton will have a tax cut that is not there. It's going to be a tax cut times 20 in reverse, like a rocket ship. We have the biggest tax cut proposed, I guess, in the last four years. And it's -- we're going to get it through. At least we're going to get most of it through. I'll tell you what, I'm going to try and get all of it through. But we have -- and it's policy, it's, you know, put out there. That doesn't mean there's not a little negotiation, because we're going to have to negotiate. But we're going to have it go. Hillary Clinton's going to have one of the biggest tax increased in the history of our country because what she's proposing, you're going to have to pay for. It's very simple. Very simply. You know, maybe she'll -- you know, after she gets rid of Bernie, get rid of all this stuff. That doesn't help you, by the way. But what she's proposing, she needs to have a massive, massive tax increase. Nobody every talks about that. Do you notice she never talks about who's going to pay for it and how they're going to pay? But just statistically, she's going to need a very major tax cut. But here's something to me that's very interesting. Fifty percent of that party is Bernie Sanders, almost, and they're very passionate. And that's a much more passionate side. Her people, they fall asleep. OK? They fall asleep. They're watching her. With Bernie's people, they're really out there. They -- say what you want about Bernie Sanders, he got it on free trade. He got it. Freed trade. Now I'm -- I'm totally -- I'm a free trader. I believe in free trade.
<TRUMP:> You know, they get it all wrong because they just don't say it properly. But I want smart trade. I want -- I want to trade with other countries. But I don't want to lose $500 billion a year <ph> with China. Thank you China, we love you very much. But we're not going to lose $500 billion. And I don't want to have a trade imbalance with Japan where they send us millions of cars and we send them some beef. And then they send it back. And then we send some wheat, wheat. They send cars we send wheat. Sounds like we've got to send a lot of wheat right? The trade imbalance is massive. And with Mexico we have an unbelievably big trade imbalance. So they kill us at the border. They kill us. They're killing us at the border. And we have one of the biggest trade imbalances. And what happens? What happens? I'm not even including the drugs right? The drugs are pouring across. You know I won the state of New Hampshire. And I got very, very friendly with the people in New Hampshire. I'll never forget them. Because that's an amazing group of people. And I said, what's your biggest problem? They said heroin pouring across the southern border. I said heroin? New Hampshire? Because you look at New Hampshire it's so beautiful, with the lakes and the little beautiful roads and the trees and the forests. And I said you don't have heroin, I said you have, he said Mr. Trump you have no idea. It's one of the worst areas for that. It comes pouring across the southern border. I said, you know what? If I win I'm going to sit, I'm going to fix that problem. I am going to fix that problem. I'm going to fix that problem. And one of the ways, I appreciate that. You know I always like to say if I win because honestly life is a very strange thing and I don't want to be accused by them of being arrogant. So I'll say if. But it better be when or I'm going to be very angry at you folks from Virginia. From Virginia. But the folks in New Hampshire and you're having the same problems. But they're having it for whatever reason disproportionately badly. Heroin is pouring across the border. And it's going, a lot of it, it's going all over the country by the way. Everybody's got the problem. You buy it for less than a candy bar. And our youth is being poisoned and plenty of other people. But our youth is being poisoned by this stuff. Heroin, heroin. And what we're going to do, thank you. What we're going to do is first of all the Border Patrol Agents endorsed me, 16,500. They've never done that before. And their job is easier now without Trump. Their job is easier without Trump. Because you know, right now they just stand and people go by. These are great people. I got to know them very well. The Border Patrol Agents want to do their job. It's a much tougher job, probably a much more dangerous jobs when you stop people and say sorry folks, boom go back. But that's more dangerous than saying, we can't do anything. It's called stand back, stand back and leave them alone. Let them walk right in. How stupid are we? How stupid are we? OK? So I spoke to them when they endorsed me. So I said, let me ask you: a wall, how important? They said Mr. Trump, it's very, very important. Very, very important. And they know. They know. See I just saved a million dollars. Somebody else would go out and hire a consultant who knows nothing. They'd come in from Harvard they'd spend about a year at the border. They'd learn nothing. They'd then write this 2,000 page report that nobody will read. They'll charge you $1 million for the report. And you have no idea what just happened.
<TRUMP:> As opposed to saying, like I did with the Border Patrol, is a wall good? They said very good. They actually used an interesting expression; they said it's a vital tool to turn things around. It was a very interesting expression. They didn't say great, bad. They just said, ""It's a vital tool, Mr. Trump, to turn things around."" Especially the drug traffic, because it's very tough. And we can build that wall so easily. And by the way, Mexico is going to pay for that wall... <APPLAUSE> ... just because. They're going to pay for the wall. And I've got great -- we got great marks on the -- on the speech the other night. And everyone did, everybody did so great. We had such -- by the way, I have to say, the Republican National Convention was such a tremendous success. It was so great. I mean, we had a couple of people that I think probably destroyed their careers, but who knows. <APPLAUSE> But honestly -- no. But honestly, that was such an incredible success. And look at what's going on in Philadelphia. That was such a beautiful deal. The city of Cleveland was great, the law enforcement was unbelievable. We had no riots, we had no nothing, it was unbelievable. I'll never forget it as long as I live. It was unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> And I made a speech -- and I have to tell you, because I figured this wouldn't happen because if I made a speech -- if I gave the Gettysburg Address as given as good as anybody could possible give -- I figured, you know, you always get -- you always <inaudible>. I got great reviews on this speech. I got great reviews. We got standing ovations. Some people said, well the speech was a little long. That's because we had 26 or 27 minutes of like standing ovation, we had applause. And I had a great time doing it because I'm talking about something that I love, we're in a movement folks, this is a movement. This isn't just -- I love what we're doing together, right? <APPLAUSE> I love -- I love what we're doing together. I love it. And what really -- what I have to say is this. So, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. She shouldn't have picked this guy, big mistake, because he is the exact opposite what all of the Bernie people <inaudible>. Now, if he got 2 percent of the vote or 5 percent of the vote or 20 percent of the vote, it's -- but you know what? He almost beat her. If the system wasn't gamed, if the system wasn't gamed, he would've beat her. He would've beaten her. Now think of this. So instead of picking somebody, and you don't have to go with Pocahontas, you don't have to go that far -- who by the way, who hasn't done anything. She's the worst -- she is the worst Senator in the U.S. Senate. You know, she's got a fresh mouth, other than that, she's got nothing going. She's has got -- she has done nothing in the U.S. Senate, but you don't have to pick her. But you could have picked a liberal person and we understand it, we could live with it. And you know, she could have had party unity. Instead, they have thousands and thousands of people going crazy because she didn't pick somebody representative, she didn't pick somebody representative of what's going on. Let's get -- look, again. She's got bad judgment. Whether it's Libya, whether it's Benghazi, whether it's at night with the calls, with the calls, everybody's calling. The only call she answers is her friend calls, she picks that one up, but she doesn't pick up the calls for help. She's got bad judgment. Bernie Sanders said, she's got bad judgment. She's got bad judgment when it came to picking a Vice Presidential candidate for that side of the party. <APPLAUSE> I actually just asked Mike Pence -- I said Mike, do you think she's going to be forced to change because honestly. Now, I wouldn't pick him, I wouldn't pick him for a different reason, though. You know why I wouldn't pick him?
<TRUMP:> So, Mike Pence of Indiana has done an unbelievable job. A triple-AAA bond rating, so many different things, job creation, top in virtually every category, right towards the top, at the top. Listen to this. During Tim Kaine's tenure as governor of Virginia, plus he's not very popular. I thought that I would see polls saying he's at 85 percent and Trump is going to lose Virginia. I'm going to -- people don't even like the guy. And <inaudible> weird little dude there. I don't know what's going on with him. During Tim Kaine's tenure as governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010, the unemployment rate of the state more than doubled. So I immediately went back to my statistician. I said, ""Listen, do me a favor? Will you please check it."" He came back. He said, ""Hey, maybe he's wrong, but more than doubled."" This is your great governor, right? Now, Governor Mike Pence cut the unemployment rate from 8.4 percent to less than five percent, quickly. <APPLAUSE> Since 2013, Indiana's gone from 31st in the nation for veterans unemployment, to second, and it's going to go first. OK? <APPLAUSE> Veterans unemployment. During Tim Kaine, that's the guy that bad judgment, crooked, Hillary Clinton, bad judgment, such bad judgment. We can't have another president with bad judgment. We can't do it. <APPLAUSE> During Tim Kaine's tenure as governor, the state of Virginia lost 60,000 manufacturing jobs. Now, Indiana gained 30,000. Now, it's a different time and different everything. He was, you know, so I'm not comparing -- they're not -- because they'll say, well, one was here and one was there. But I'll tell you, if Mike Pence or me was running Virginia, we'd do great. This guy did a lousy job. You know why? He's a political hack. That's why. He's a political hack. Look what he's done. Look what he's done. He's always been in politics. He likes politics. He wants to be in politics always. OK. During Tim Kaine's tenure as governor of Virginia, it averaged almost no GDP growth. And Indiana, as you know, is doing great. I mean, think of it. Here's a beauty. OK. Nobody is going to vote for Tim Kaine when you hear this one. OK? Tim Kaine. I never even heard of this guy, but that's OK. Less than a week after Tim Kaine became governor of Virginia -- one week -- he proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase -- $4 billion. <BOOING> Including a tax increase on people earning as little at $17,000 a year. <BOOING> He tried to pass transportation reform. He failed, whereas Mike Pence had tremendous <inaudible>. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. So a $4 billion tax increase his first week. Do we want this as a president? Now, you know, look, hopefully we don't have to worry about it. I will say this, Virginia has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton -- these are my statisticians; they're great -- signed the agreement to put China into the World Trade Organization. Don't forget he did that. But Bill Clinton signed something that was the worst trade bill ever in the history of this country -- OK? -- in the history of this country: NAFTA. That was Bill Clinton. People don't realize.
<TRUMP:> I'll tell you a little joke. See how hot it is, everyone? Everyone's sweating and soaking wet, right? Here's the difference. I wouldn't pay the hotel bill. I'd say we're in a hotel, we're in a ballroom, and you know what? These are grown companies. We're in a ballroom. And if we're in a ballroom, it's not supposed to be so hot that everybody in the audience is using as a fan. So what they do is they turn the air conditioning down because they save money. So then, I would not pay them. And you know what I do? I pay my bills so fast with somebody good. With somebody average, I pay them OK. With somebody great, a lot of times, I give them bonuses. But here we are in a ballroom and I'm like -- I feel like I'm in a sauna, OK? <LAUGHTER> Right? <APPLAUSE> Right? So I don't know what hotel this is, but you ought to try turning on the air conditioning or we're not going to get you paid <ph>. These people <ph>. <APPLAUSE> Is -- am I right? It's hot. <APPLAUSE> Just so you know, I'm really good at this business. You make a lot more money if you own a hotel and you let people suffer and don't turn on air conditioning. You make a lot more money. You would be surprised at how much it costs, but this is ridiculous. And -- so then, there'll an article. ""Donald Trump Refuses to Pay the Bill."" Of course. <LAUGHTER> And you know what? The smart people say Trump is smart. The other people would say, ""Isn't that terrible."" OK? I think the ballroom and the people that own this hotel should be ashamed of themselves. All right. So look. <APPLAUSE> Look. So Virginia lost one in three manufacturing jobs since the Bill Clinton bill. Hillary supported China's entry into WTO. Roanoke, which is a beautiful place, by the way, has lost one -- and I've been here many times -- has lost one in three manufacturing jobs, OK, since the Clinton disasters. Last year, the U.S. trade deficit with TPP countries -- I mean, I could go into this -- I could read this stuff to you. It gets a little boring after a while, but it's all the same thing. We have -- Hillary Clinton wanted to approve TPP, that's Trans-Pacific Partnership. And then I announced that I'm against it. And then she heard me make in a speech. This is what I've heard. A friend of mine told me. And I basically said the various reasons, including monetary manipulation, currency manipulation, et cetera, why it's no good, why it will be another NAFTA but maybe even worse. Can't be worse, but it'll be as bad, OK? Different countries, but it'll be as bad. And she heard me. And she said, ""He'll kill me in the debate."" So what happened is she all of a sudden came out against TPP. But as sure as you're sitting there, she's going to approve TPP. If she won, she will approve it. She'll make a change. She'll make a comma. She'll say, ""Move that comma. Now, I can do it."" OK. Folks. Six-thousand pages of material that most people haven't read. It is a disaster. Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disaster. You can't let it happen. We will never let it happen. I will never ever let it happen. <APPLAUSE> And I don't want to make deals with many countries; I want to do one-on-one deals, one-on-one. You've got to see this deal. It's like a fancy jigsaw puzzle. Lines <ph> going here, here, there. So if one of the country misbehaves, you can't do anything because you're so locked up into this very complex agreement. And believe me, it's just like Obamacare. Thousands of pages and nobody in Congress read it, and now it's a disaster. And we will repeal it and replace it with something fabulous. OK? All right? <APPLAUSE> But -- but we're going to have something that's going to be very special. And I have to tell you, I appreciate you all being here and I really wish -- I appreciate it, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> And I appreciate the folks in the room next door, which is almost as big as this and it's packed also.
<TRUMP:> And even more than you folks, I appreciate the people standing outside in 104. They're dying. They're dying. <APPLAUSE> Although I venture say that they're more comfortable than I am right now. It's probably -- I think it's actually cooler outside than it is in this damned ballroom. Ridiculous. <APPLAUSE> Ridiculous. But you know what? I'll tell you. You know what I love? Look at this room. It's packed. You know what I love? And the other room is packed. What I love? Nobody left. Not one person. I always watch the doors. If I see doors starting to open, people pouring out, I usually stop. But that never happens with me. Never, ever. But I stop. Nobody leaves. Because you know what? We're in this together. We're in this together. This is a movement. So Time magazine just did an another cover. I talked about it. You saw the one from the back of my head. Right? It's pretty full back there. You know, could be better. Could be better, but not bad. But a picture from the back of my head. The guy was standing right over me with a camera like this. I studied that picture very closely. I didn't read the story, but I did study the picture. You know, I think that's number five or six that we've had. So I think I've had two in my lifetime, and five or six in the last few months where, you know, we had this incredible thing going on. And they called it a movement. And Bill O'Reilly calls is a movement. He's never seen anything like it. He said in his professional career, in his whole lifetime he actually said, this is the single greatest political phenomena that he's ever witnessed. And Brit Hume said it, and a lot of people have said it. <APPLAUSE> And I really mean this. It's not about me. It's about you. There's -- I'm a messenger. There's a group of people in this country that's massive. You know, they used to call it a silent majority. I don't use the term. It's a noisy majority, because we've had it. We've had it with the Iran deal. We've had it with our depleted military. We've had it with no borders. <APPLAUSE> We've had it with education where we're ranked right near the bottom. We're doing horribly. We've had it where they want to essentially abolish your Second Amendment. You have no protection for yourself. All right? We've had it. <BOOING> And by the way, the NRA endorsed me and they're great people, 100 percent. And the evangelicals -- how many evangelicals to we have in here? <APPLAUSE> You better get out and vote because you didn't vote for Romney, and you better get out and vote for me. You know, we have the Johnson amendment, where Lyndon Johnson, who was very powerful, put in an amendment where basically our pastors, our ministers, and all religions, they don't have the right to speak up. And I had -- I had a meeting -- I was telling Franklin Graham, who's a great guy, I was telling Jerry Falwell Jr., who is a great guy, great guy. I mean, so many. We had a meeting where we had 50 to 60 pastors, ministers. And they were saying, ""We love you."" And they were praying. And it was like this incredible scene. And I said, ""OK, well, folks, can you endorse me?"" ""Well, we can't do that."" ""Why?"" ""Because we'll lose our tax exempt status."" I said, ""Why?"" Now, nobody brought this up to me. They were living with it. Nobody was going to go fight it. I said, ""Why do you lose your tax exempt status?"" ""Well, we're not allowed to speak."" And I said, ""Wait,"" and I looked into it. I said, ""Whoa."" And that was passed by the ultimate politician, Lyndon Johnson. I mean, it's not like we're dealing with the pope. This was Lyndon Johnson -- smart, tough guy, but we're smarter and tougher.
<TRUMP:> But look, that was passed by a politician because he had problems with some of the churches in Texas where they were going after him for good reason. And I said, ""Wait a minute, folks."" Now, we put in our platform that we're going to work like hell to get rid of the Johnson amendment because... <APPLAUSE> ... because your representatives, ministers, pastors, rabbis, they have totally lost their voice. And don't kid yourself, that's what's happening to religion in this country because you see the same numbers that I see. So I think this -- if you're evangelical, if you're Christian, if you're Jewish, if you have religion, you better go out and vote for Trump because this is going to be the last chance you're ever going to get to get this thing going. OK? <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> So I said in my -- I will say this, I said in my speech in the other night and I meant it, I thank the evangelicals because I want to get these tremendous voices. They said, ""Trump can't win South Carolina, right?"" And I said, why? I have a tremendous piece of ground. I won with the evangelicals. I won all over with the evangelicals because they get it, they're smart and they understand. They know I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect, but they know I love them and they know I'm going to fight for them better than somebody that is perfect. I'm going to fight for them. I'm going to fight for other religions. I'm going to fight. I'm going to fight for people to be able to speak. And actually when they said this to me, I was in an office building very high up and I'm looking down. I said to these powerful pastors, these power men and women, they're just powerful people, just tremendous strength and energy and conviction. They were in a whirlwind, it was beautiful, their voices. I said, ""but that means that you are less powerful than those people walking down the street."" I pointed to the street, ""they have a right to talk and you don't. You don't have your right to talk."" That's our religion. That's our religion. <APPLAUSE> In my case, I'm Presbyterian, I'm a Protestant, but that's our religion. And my minister, who I like a lot, doesn't have the right to speak. We're going to end that folks. With one chance, we're going to have it. So you better go back to your churches and you better get everybody to vote because four years ago, they didn't get up. They didn't vote for Romney, and to this day, a lot of people understand it. Though, some people do understand it.. Frankly, you better get up and you better vote. It you vote - if you think about it, if you take Christians, Jewish, some of the Catholic, take the religions, it's bigger than men and it's bigger than women. It's bigger than men. You know, men are 50 percent, women are 50 percent, the religion is like what 80 percent. If you get up and vote, we're going to get rid of that. And we're going to free up great people to go and speak what they want to speak about, and they should be able to speak. <APPLAUSE> So just a couple of things. I would like to bring Mike up. Just a couple things, we are going to strengthen our military. Our military is really depleted, it's not good. <APPLAUSE> I didn't want to go into Iraq. We got there. I said, ""Keep the oil."" They didn't keep the oil. These people don't know what they're doing. You know, in the old days, you're in a war, to the victor belong the spoils, right? Today, we get nothing. Trillions of dollars in costs. Thousands and thousands of lives lost, we get nothing. Iraq is a disaster. The Middle East is worse now than it was 15 years ago by a factor of 20. If we would have done nothing, we would have been much better off. We have to build up our military. We never needed it so much. We never needed our military so much.
<TRUMP:> So we're going to take care of our country. We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to take care of our people. We're going to make America great again. And I have to tell you, one of the really good decisions, because I laugh when they say, ""Do you think Mr. Trump likes Governor Mike Pence?"" I love this guy. He's great. He's great. And everybody does. I'm getting such great marks and such great reviews. Unlike Hillary. Did I ask you before? Do you think she'll change? He looked at me and said no way, because it's hard to do, right? She may be forced -- she may be forced to change. He actually -- I'll tell you -- Tim Kaine stands for the exact opposite of all of the Bernie Sanders people. I mean, it's ridiculous what she did. Again, bad judgment. So I'm going to have Mike say just a few of the final words, and I'm going to sit down and watch him. He is some great person. He's got some wonderful family. And we are having such fun going all over the place. And so Mike can finish off, and I want to thank you, folks. Thank you. <APPLAUSE>
<PENCE: And Mike, you know what's funny? Some of the great musicians have said, ""Never do an encore when you've (inaudible)."" So look how strong this? Everyone standing. Everyone (inaudible). Now, if we do an encore, we'll get a couple of bad questions. We'll walk out. They'll say they weren't so great. Right? But we'll do it anyway. Right? Do it anyway? So Mike was just asking if we'd want to take some questions.>
<PENCE: Yeah, why don't we take some questions from the crowd?>
<TRUMP:> If you guys want to ask a couple of questions, fine. You go ahead, Mike.
<PENCE: Yeah, we've got -- how about one more time for Donald Trump, everybody? Bringing the heat today. Isn't that great? (APPLAUSE) Bringing the real heat. They've got some people out here that have -- that have microphones. Get your hand in the air. We'll take a few questions -- and, ready right here? OK. Right over here. Yes, ma'am?>
<TRUMP:> Go ahead.
<QUESTION: I support you very much, Mr. Trump. Thank you. What are you going to do for the youth? How are you going to make the community safer for us?>
<TRUMP:> We're going to work. One thing we have to do for the youth, and it's a question I get asked, Mike, more than any other question. We have young, fantastic people going to college and they're choking on their debt. OK? They're choking on debt. They haven't started life yet, and some of them have given up before they start it because they see no way. We're going to work on a plan and we're working on it now so that we can help young people get through college, and not die <inaudible>. I mean, some of these kids, what they're doing is incredible -- the massive depression that's going on because they see no way of ever being able to pay it back. Now, part of that's going to be jobs. But we're working on a plan now to take care of youth with respect to college debt. We're going to work on a very good plan. We have to. We have to.
<PENCE: And let me tell you -- let me tell you, Donald was very kind to mention my wife, Karen Pence, and our recent college graduate daughter, Charlotte Pence, are with us today. Would you welcome them? (APPLAUSE) And I will tell you, the focus on college debt is something we've been focused on in the state of Indiana, focusing on on-time completion, right? And four years costs less than five years; three years costs less than four years. But the best thing Donald Trump will do for the youth of America is get this economy moving again and create jobs and opportunities for young people coming out of high school, coming out of the trades, and coming out of college. (APPLAUSE) Another one? Yes, go ahead.>
<QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Trump, for being here in Virginia. And I apologize for the heat, but I do have a question for you.>
<TRUMP:> Do you own the hotel? <LAUGHTER>
<QUESTION: Sir, if I owned this hotel, it would be 60 degrees in here because that's just...>
<TRUMP:> I bet. <LAUGHTER>
<QUESTION: But Mr. Trump, with all things -- God knows, with all things popular, we're praying that you are our president come November. The question for you, Mr. Trump, is will you stand by Israel 100 percent and do whatever it takes to preserve the nation of God?>
<TRUMP:> One-hundred percent. We have to stand by Israel, 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> Yes? Yes? Hello.
<QUESTION: Hello. I have one question for you, Mr. Trump.>
<TRUMP:> These are usually the toughest questions. <LAUGHTER>
<PENCE: What's your name, son? What's your name?>
<QUESTION: Jacob.>
<PENCE: Jacob?>
<QUESTION: Jones.>
<PENCE: Jacob Jones?>
<QUESTION: Jacob Jones.>
<PENCE: Hey, Jake. Go ahead.>
<QUESTION: I have one question for you, Mr. Trump. Now, when you are in office, what -- what will be the timeline for that wall that you're going to build? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> He knows. He knows. Jacob, that wall will go up so fast and be so big and powerful and as good-looking as we can make it that your head will spin. OK? Believe me. It's going to go up fast. Thank you. <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE>
<PENCE: Next question.>
<TRUMP:> Go ahead. How about over here? Go ahead. Sure.
<QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)>
<TRUMP:> Congratulations. <APPLAUSE>
<QUESTION: I have a small business in Roanoke and a poultry shop. What are going to do for businesses like us who is just one or two or three people working?>
<TRUMP:> Cut your taxes and no more crazy regulations. OK? <APPLAUSE>
<QUESTION: Thank you.>
<TRUMP:> Big <ph>, right?
<QUESTION: Thank you.>
<TRUMP:> All right? The regulations are out of control. You know, Mike -- so I've been all over the country and I would've always said taxes would be like the biggest thing. If I had my guess, I would say that people are more angry about regulations than the fact that we pay among the highest taxes in the world.
<PENCE: That's right.>
<TRUMP:> So we'll cut the regulations. OK?
<PENCE: Can I also say -- I grew up in small business family in a small town in southern Indiana. And one of the reasons when -- after I became governor of Indiana, first thing we did was we cut taxes across the board, we cut the income taxes because what this businessman knows is most small business owners file their taxes as individuals. And so with the Trump plan to cut taxes, we're going to lower taxes on individuals, we're going to lower taxes on small business and I promise you this man is going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel. We're going to get red tape off your back and let you grow. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> OK. How about one more -- one more question?
<PENCE: One more.>
<TRUMP:> One more.
<PENCE: One more.>
<TRUMP:> Who's got a good one? Who's got a good one? Go ahead. Give him -- I like that question, actually, right? Give him a mic because that's such a great question. Go ahead.
<QUESTION: God bless America. All right. It's on now (inaudible). OK. The most important question of all, of course, is how can we be praying for you? We love you so much, Donald Trump. And Mike, we are so proud of you guys. You guys are our anthem, you guys are supporting the Constitution better than we ever could have thought a candidate could.>
<QUESTION: Both of you are champions and patriots. We love you. We're proud of you. And we want to pray for you. Maybe not -- why don't I just pray for you guys right now? I'll do it right now. (APPLAUSE) OK, OK, OK. Lord, we thank you so much for what these men represent in this country. We thank you for that your hand is upon them and that they are called up and raised up for this time. And we are asking right now that they will be able to stand firm against the wiles of the enemy. God, against Satan. We live in a supernatural world. Look at this ball we're on. We are held down by gravity, two inches closer to the sun, we would all burn. Too inches further, we would all freeze. So we just ask right now God, that we will humble ourselves and realize that we are created, and we need your help and your support to make them the vessels that they need to be to stand up for freedom. This is the freedom that you authored in our Constitution. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.>
<TRUMP:> Wow. Are you a minister or a pastor? He is. Thank you very much. Now, I feel better, he is. So ladies and gentleman, I just want to thank you. That's a great way to end actually. I just want to thank you for being here. It's so important that on November 8, you have to get out and vote. If for no other reason, remember this, remember this, strong defense, strong borders, but remember, Supreme Court Justices. We're going to be appoint, and Mike will be absolutely right there with me. We'll be picking the best right off that list. We are going to be appointing anywhere from two to five, it could even be. And if you put the wrong people on, you're back to Venezuela. This is Venezuela. So let me just tell you, if you can, get your friends, get everything you have to do on November 8. Please get out to vote. It's going to be tough. It's going to be tough because it's a stacked decked. It's a rigged system against all of us. The reason I won is because we had such an outpouring of love. I mean, the numbers were so big, they couldn't do anything about it. Let me tell you, you have to get out on November 8, and you have to vote. You have to get your friends, and your family, and everybody out to vote. OK, thank you all very much. We love you. We will be back. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-07-26"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much, everybody. Wow. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much. What a privilege to be here with the incredible -- and I mean incredible -- men and women of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. And we set today, an all-time registration record. That's pretty good, right? Congratulations to you. Spending time with our veterans has been the greatest honor of this campaign. I want to thank commander-in-chief, Big John, and really, for the welcome. He has been so fantastic. From the time we walked in, he has been so fantastic. Also, many thanks to Bob Wallace, Auxiliary President Francisca Guilford, and for your incoming leadership. You have Brian Duffy and Colette Bishop, two terrific people. <APPLAUSE> Two terrific people. Before going any further today, I'd like to bring up on to this stage my good friend, Governor Mike Pence. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, Mike is the son of a soldier and the father of a Marine. Mike?
<PENCE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Thank you to Commander Biedrzycki. It's an honor to greet you all at the 117th VFW, where no one does more for veterans. Thanks for all you do. (APPLAUSE) It is an honor to stand with Donald Trump today. It is even a greater honor for me to stand with those of you who have worn the uniform of the United States. As Mr. Trump just said, I -- I am -- I was not a soldier, but I am the son of a combat veteran who served in Korea. (APPLAUSE) And I am the proud father of a United States Marine, and I feel a great indebtedness to all of you who served. And -- and -- and I'm proud of the record we had in the state of Indiana.>
<PENCE: You'll be glad to know in Indiana, where more than 500,000 veterans call home, we've made extraordinary commitments. We've more than doubled the funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. We increased the number of county veteran service officers ten fold from seven to 72 counties. And I'm proud to say the Hoosier state now has the second lowest employment rate for veterans in the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) But I answered this call. When Donald Trump called, I answered this call for a few very simply reasons. Number one, I answered it because in these challenging times, I believe we need renewed and strong American leadership at home and abroad, and Donald Trump will bring that leadership for this nation. (APPLAUSE) Our military is too small and he will rebuild it. (APPLAUSE) Our V.A. is broken and this builder will fix it. (APPLAUSE) And it is extraordinary to think that yesterday in Philadelphia, 61 speakers came to the podium and not one of them named ISIS by name. This man will name our enemies without apology and he will defeat them. (APPLAUSE) So I say thank you to the VFW. I say thank you. I say thank you to my new boss, a man who has given me the privilege to run and serve as vice president of the United States of America. And I pledge to you, each of you, that if we have the privilege to serve, I know this man's heart. I hear the way he speaks when the cameras are off about those who serve and those who have served. And we will ensure that our soldiers have the resources they need to complete their mission and come home safe, and we will stand, as the VFW does, with him and her who hell have borne the battle on their shoulders. We shall stand with our veterans and we shall see our way forward as a nation. Thank you very much and God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, Mike. And thanks again to everyone for inviting me to address you today. The veterans -- I love you, too. <LAUGHTER> The Veterans of Foreign Wars represent the very, very best of America. When I'm president, I pledge to work closely with your organization and your members to accomplish our shared goals. Our veterans are the bravest and the finest people on Earth. <APPLAUSE> The members of your organization have fought for the American flag, and boy have you fought, on distant battlefields all across the world. Your members have shed their blood and poured out their hearts for this nation like nobody else. Our debt to you is eternal. <APPLAUSE> Yet our politicians have totally failed you. Our most basic commitment to provide health and medical care to those who fought for us so bravely has been violated completely. The V.A. scandals that have occurred are widespread and totally inexcusable. As we know, many have died waiting for care that never came, a permanent stain on our government. Can you imagine the waste and corruption -- and I tell you we will find it and we will find it big league <ph> when I become president in January 2017. <APPLAUSE> I've recently released a detailed 10-step veterans reform plan and we've worked on the plan with the chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee in the House and a really good guy who loves the vets, Jeff Miller. <APPLAUSE> He is a good man. We're going to take care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before. <APPLAUSE> The other candidate in this race, you know, her name, crooked Hillary Clinton -- and believe me, folks, she is crooked -- has a much different view. She recently said of the V.A. scandal that it's not as widespread as it's been purported to be. It's like she's trying to sweep it under the rug, which by the way, politicians have done for years and years and years. It's going to be four more years of the same if she ever got in. But that's not going to happen. <APPLAUSE> Make America great again, you're right. Thank you. We know how she takes cares of the veterans. Just look at her invasion of Libya and her handling of Benghazi. A disaster. Or look at her e-mails, which put America's entire national security at risk. And to think, she was here yesterday. I guess she didn't do very well. <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> We're going to bring honesty back to government, and that starts with fixing the Veterans Administration. We will fix it. Here is my 10 step plan for veterans reform. One, I will appoint a secretary of Veterans Affairs who will make it their personal mission to clean up the V.A., and this person, man or woman, will be outstanding with an outstanding track record. <APPLAUSE> In other words, a person that can get it done. Number two, I'm going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who breach their public trust. Three... <APPLAUSE> I will ask Congress to pass a bill giving the V.A. secretary full authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health, safety or wellbeing of a veteran. <APPLAUSE> I will appoint a commission to investigate all of the wrongdoing at the V.A., of which there is plenty, and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for reforming the entire system. Five, I'm going to make sure that the honest and dedicated people of the V.A., of which we have many, have their jobs protected and are put in line for promotion. When they do a good job, we are going to get them promoted, like they deserve. <APPLAUSE> I will create a private White House hotline. This could keep me very busy at night, folks. This will take the place of twitter. <LAUGHTER> Lot of truth to that. That is answered by a real person 24 hours a day to make sure that no valid complaint about the V.A. ever falls through the cracks. <APPLAUSE> Now, this is the tough part. This is the tough part. I will instruct my staff that if a valid complaint is not acted upon, then the issuer who brought it <ph> directly to me, and I want to have it, will bring it directly to me and I will pick up the phone personally and get it completed and get it taken care of. That's a lot of work. We better do a good job because that's a lot of work.
<TRUMP:> But I want to have somebody, a real person and a really competent person in the White House with that hotline going. And if that person's not doing the job, I'm going to find out about it, and that's the best way to find out about it. That's called real life. That's called business. Instead of giving bonuses to employees for wasting money, we are going to create a new incentive program that rewards employees for saving money and improving the quality of care. <APPLAUSE> Our VSA <ph> programs will be reformed to ensure that veterans are put in the front of the line for jobs in this country. They fought and they protect us, now we're going to fight <sic> them; they're going to put right in the front of the line and these are our great people. And by the way, Governor Pence is right at the top of the nation in employment for vets. When he took over, he was number 32 or 38. Now he's right at the top. He has done an incredible job with respect to employment for vets. So Mike, good going and keep it going. <APPLAUSE> We're going to increase the number of mental health care professionals and increase mental health outreach to veterans outside of the system. So important. We're going to ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top quality care including the best care in the world for our female veterans. <APPLAUSE> The veterans health system will remain a public system, because it is a public trust. But never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care. That means veterans will have the right to go to a V.A. facility or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice, whatever is fastest and best for the veteran. There will be no more five-day waits in line. If you're waiting in line, you're going to go to a private doctor across the street, a private or public hospital across the street or nearby, and you're going to be taken care of quickly and efficiently. People are waiting in line five days, six days, seven days. And many are dying. With a simple procedure, they would live. And they're dying because they can't even get to see their doctor. So there's not going to be any more of that. And we will pick up the bill. It will cost us less money and the care will be amazing. OK? You have my word on that. <APPLAUSE> Come January 20, if I'm elected president, you're going to notice a change in the V.A. and in the whole entire government system, which is a mess. <APPLAUSE> All you have to do is try to get on an airplane and you'll see what a mess it is. A change in attitude and a change in results will absolutely take place so fast, right at the beginning. Government is going to start working for the people again. The special interests opposing our reform, and they do oppose it for their own reasons, and reform for America, the same people who have led us to one economic and foreign policy disaster after another. The global corporations and the media executives who oppose our plans, and they are opposing them strongly -- we need plans for change. And we want to keep the system in place, except for the section that's rigged, and that's a lot of it. We're getting rid of our rigged system. I started using that term a year-and-a-half ago, and now everybody's using it. This morning, I was watching one of the Democrats, who I've been talking about as a rigged system. He used the word ""rigged system."" I'm going to have to come up now with another word. It's very sad. <LAUGHTER> But the system is rigged, so badly rigged. And it's rigged against the veterans, too. That's why their message is that things can't change, can't change. With these people, they can't change. These are the same special interests who have driven the economy into the ground and who have created one calamity after another overseas -- horrible, horrible thought process. These Washington interests are telling Americans to stay the course. They're telling us that we can't fix our trade deals or we can't fix our V.A. or we can't fix our broken tax system, or we can't fix immigration, because they're benefiting from the status quo. They benefit. They don't want to change. We need change. They don't want to change. My message is the opposite. Things have to change. And they have to change right now. <APPLAUSE> Here is just some of the change we need. We need to change our tax, energy and regulatory policies to produce millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth and invest in our country and in our infrastructure, which is falling apart all over this country -- our roads, our tunnels, our bridges, our airports. Our infrastructure is that of a third-world country. Not anymore. And I'm very good at building. Remember that. And I build under-time and under-budget. Very important. You don't hear that from government very often. Those who seek to raise taxes and expand regulation will only weaken our country, hamstring our economy, and throw many millions more out of work. And as you know, Hillary Clinton wants to institute a massive tax increase, massive tax increase. And we're already just about the highest-taxed nation in the world. Our immigration system must also be fixed, so it lifts people out of poverty instead of throwing them into poverty, which is what it's doing right now. Our terrible trade deal must be renegotiated completely. NAFTA is a disaster. To keep jobs and wealth in America -- we're sending our jobs away. We're going to keep our jobs in America. And we're going to bring new jobs back. <APPLAUSE> We need to change our foreign policy to focus in defeating and destroying ISIS, a word you didn't hear last night at the Democrat convention. You didn't hear it. They don't want to talk about it. Because in a very true way, they really established ISIS because of weakness. The people in this room know better than anybody else or any other audience what I mean by weakness. But because of weakness, ISIS has been established. It's also essential that we suspend the refugee flows from Syria and other dangerous countries so we don't bring into the United States the same terrorism that our American soldiers are fighting overseas. We have to be smart. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Hillary Clinton wants to bring in, if you can believe this, 550 percent more than President Obama. More. And Tim Kaine wrote a letter very recently asking for more than even Hillary wants. What are we doing? What are we doing? We have to be the smart country again, or we're in big, big trouble. Our depleted military must be completely rebuilt. Then from a position of strength and respect, America needs to extend our hand in friendship to foreign nations who want to be our friends, and we can't be taken advantage of by these countries that we work so closely with. Many of these countries are taking advantage of us, folks. They're taking advantage of us. We want to be friends, but they also have to be friends with us. Remember that -- something you've never heard from a politician.
<TRUMP:> We want a more peaceful future for our world. But peace will require new approaches, not relying on the same failed voices of the past. These are failed voices. And now they want another four years. And we need to fix the V.A., so we never break our sacred commitment to our veterans, never ever again. <APPLAUSE> We can do all of these things. We simply need to stop relying on the politicians who created these problems in the first place. They are not going to do anything. I call them all talk, no action. That's what they are. They are politicians. All talk, no action. We can't fix a rigged system by electing the people who rigged it in the first place. <APPLAUSE> Let's reject the doubters and the cynics, and choose instead to believe in ourselves and in our country. It's time to follow the example of our amazing veterans who work together across racial lines, across income lines, across all lines in unity of mission and purpose. Nobody does it better than our veterans. <APPLAUSE> Let them be our guide. It's time to believe in each other, and it's time again to believe in America. <APPLAUSE> If we do this, we'll truly, absolutely 100 percent make America great again, greater than ever, ever, ever before. Thank you very much. God bless you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE>","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-07-27"">
<PENCE: I'm Governor Mike Pence. (APPLAUSE) I am humbled and honored to have the opportunity to run and serve with the next President of the United States of America, Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) It's a joy to see you today. It's wonderful to be in Pennsylvania. Our nominee and I have been traveling relentlessly since the close of a great and successful Republican National Convention that sent the message to America that America longs it here (ph). (APPLAUSE) When I got that call just about two weeks ago, it was 11 O'clock at night, was in my office, my wife at my side. We had prayed through it and when Donald Trump called and asked me to serve as his running mate and Vice Presidential nominee, I answered in a heartbeat, because Donald Trump has a vision to make America great again. (APPLAUSE) I answered the call for three reasons and I'll share them with you briefly before I bring in the main event. (APPLAUSE) Number one - number one for all of my years in public life as a Governor and on Capital Hill, and after seven and a half years of failed leadership that has weakened America's place in the world and stifled our economy, I said yes because Hillary Clinton must never become President of the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) Secondly I said yes in a heartbeat, because I know what strong leadership can mean. Strong, common sense, conservative leadership has changed the trajectory of my State of Indiana. You know, it was about 10 short years ago, Indiana found ourselves kind of nestled in the midst of what the rest of America calls the Rust Belt. We were awash in deficits and debt with moribund economy. But then we elected strong, conservative leadership and in just 10 short years, as I stand before you today, as Governor of the State of Indiana, we've been able to demonstrate that you can make record investments in education, you can build the roads and bridges of the crossroads of America, you can expand opportunities for disadvantaged families, to choose the school of their choice, you can pass tax cuts every single year and still have the strongest balanced budget of any state in America. That's what strong Republican leadership can give you. And that's exactly what Donald Trump will bring to the White House. (APPLAUSE) Lastly, I said yes, because I had the privilege to get to know this good man and his good wonderful family. He's a dreamer, he's a builder, he's a fighter, and he's a patriot, and he's a man who will put America first and put America back on top again. (APPLAUSE) So let me say, for a stronger America at home and abroad, for a military that will be able to defend our nation and stand for our allies, to have a commander-in-chief who will name our enemy and marshal the resources to crush them at the source. To restore fiscal sanity to Washington, D.C., to lower taxes for better trade deals and a secure border for the United States of America... (APPLAUSE) For an American energy policy that will end the war on coal once and for all, and for a President who will appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will respect our god-given liberties, the sanctity of light, and our Second Amendment -- I give you the next President of the United States of America, Donald trump. (APPLAUSE) D. >
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Whoa. Whoa. This is amazing. This is amazing. USA. Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> This is incredible. You know, I had a press conference before and one of the questions was, ""Mr. Trump, what are you doing? You are not supposed to be campaigning today. You have broken all of the rules. What is going on? They are having their convention. Sir, you are not supposed to be campaigning."" Well, guess what, folks? We are campaigning. We are going to make America great folks. We are going to make America great again. Remember that. <APPLAUSE> And they said the same thing, you know, during the primaries. We have 17 people, very talented people. And they said the same thing -- this will never work because Trump comes in, he has these big rallies, and then he leaves. And I'm supposed to have dinner, like, with two people, spend the entire evening; they go to another <inaudible>. And they said, well, why do you do that? I said well, I do it because I can get to rallies. The other people can't get to rallies. It's very simple -- it's very simple. <APPLAUSE> But that worked. I have to thank two people that have been unbelievable and great friends: Tom Marino, congressman. Where's Tom? Get up here, Tom. Get up here. <APPLAUSE> And Lou Barletta, get up here -- oh, there it is -- Lou, Lou, Lou. <APPLAUSE> All right. They have, like, big fences to cross. Just a minute. OK. We all know what you look like. But they have been so great right from the beginning, and I wan to thank -- I want to thank you both. I want to thank you both. Thank you. I mean it. <APPLAUSE> So, it's been an amazing -- yeah, sit down. Come on. We've got plenty of time. Well, we have nothing but time. It's a nice place. <APPLAUSE> This is very nice. First of all, Mike Pence has been amazing. <APPLAUSE> And you know, one of the reasons, and this is 100 percent, one of the reasons I chose Mike was because Indiana under his leadership has done so well. It's done so incredibly -- AAA bond rating. They have really low unemployment, one of the top few states. Everything's good, even for the veterans in terms of employment, I think it was 32 or 38. No, that's not the good number. That was when he got into office. And when he left, right now, basically they were number two in the nation and he wants it to be number one. That's incredible. That's veterans being employed by some of the folks in this room. So that was great. <APPLAUSE> Now, when we won New York, you know, we had these incredible victories. What do I know about politics? But we do have a lot of common sense, all of us, don't we? We know. We know. <APPLAUSE> We know a lot. We know a lot. I had a run that was incredible. It started with New York. And New York -- and you know what's nice? I won New York... <CROSSTALK> ... Queens, Queens, you're right. Queens. He knows. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? <CROSSTALK> But we had this incredible period of time, and we just kept winning, winning, winning. But I went to New York and we had a massive landslide victory -- won just about everything. And in my victory speech, I don't even know why I said it -- but I said, ""And we're going to"" -- this is in the middle of Fifth Avenue, OK? -- ""we're going to put the miners back to work."" I said that. <APPLAUSE> I don't even know why. And by the way, that includes the steelworkers, and we're going to take a lot of the regulations off of gas, because gas is big, and they want to close you down. They want to close the mines down. They've been closing mines down. It's sad. It's sad. But little did I realize that shortly thereafter I'd go to a place called West Virginia. And did they love Trump. Did you see those numbers? <APPLAUSE> And Hillary Clinton -- crooked Hillary Clinton, she's really crooked. <BOOING> So Hillary Clinton -- thank you. <LAUGHTER> <BOOING> <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! D.>
<TRUMP:> You know what we're going to do? Even better, we're going to beat her on November 8th. We're going to beat her. OK? <APPLAUSE> That's even better. OK? That's what we're going to do. Got to get out there. We got to vote. You got to get out there. We got to get out there. But do you remember -- so Hillary gave a press conference in an area where coal and the different things that we all love wasn't so important, right? And she figured she'd make the statement and it wouldn't get back to West Virginia. It got back to West Virginia and it got back to Pennsylvania and it got back to Ohio and it got back to a lot of places that she didn't want to hear that message. She said, ""We're going to put the coal miners and we're going to put the coal mines out of business."" OK? No good. And we had an event. It was at a big, massive place -- it was beautiful -- in West Virginia and the place was packed. It has to be 10,000, 12,000 people and outside, they had at least double that number. And it was love. And I went and saw some of the miners and I said, ""So tell me, would you ever think of like leaving and going to another place and maybe doing something else instead of this?"" They said, ""Mr. Trump,"" and I understand this so well, ""we love mining. We love doing it. This is our livelihood. Our fathers, our grandfathers -- this is what we do. We do it so well. We don't want to do something else."" And I said, ""I love that."" I love that. I can understand it and I love that. Love it. <APPLAUSE> So hang in, because we're going to put you back to work. We're going to put you back. It's going to be a beautiful thing to see because these are great people. These are amazing people. And so many from this area, but so many from this state. And I went to school in Pennsylvania. I love Pennsylvania. <APPLAUSE> You know, I love Pennsylvania. And we're just going to -- you know, when I look at -- I look around and I see what happened, I -- I didn't need to do this. I had a very nice life. <LAUGHTER> Beautiful family, beautiful business. I built this incredible company. All this, and I just couldn't stand -- you look at the Iran deal, you look at so many -- everything is wrong. Everything is wrong. Take a look. I'll tell you what. Let's talk. Take a look at the convention that's going on right now. They don't honor -- think of it. They don't honor our police, they don't honor our law enforcement. We started complaining they had no American flags on this massive stage. They had no American flags. They forgot. They forgot to put up -- now, we had a lot of flags. <APPLAUSE> Somebody said, ""I can't see you, Mr. Trump. There are too many flags."" I said, ""That's OK. We'll leave it that way."" But we had a tremendous success and we got a balance <ph> that, according to one of the networks, that it was one of the biggest balances <ph> that anyone's seen. <APPLAUSE> Now, I give a lot of credit for that to my family. My family, Melania and Tiffany... <APPLAUSE> And Ivanka and Don and Eric. And they talk about these people. They say, ""Stars, stars."" I'd rather have those five stars much more so, those five-plus one, by the way. <APPLAUSE> But they did an amazing job. And I have one of the stars with me. Should I introduce you to Eric? Eric. Eric. Get over here, Eric. Come here. <APPLAUSE> E. 
<TRUMP:> Wow, look at this crowd. This is amazing. Well, you know, guys, I had to come today. I spent so much of my youth in Scranton, in Coverdale, and Waverly. So many of my best friends in the world -- I went to boarding school in Pennsylvania for five years and I just love this state. I know this area as well as anyone and I just had to be here today. We have so many great friends and thank you. You know, we just came off a convention and we had a great time. It was honor to be up there and to talk about my father. We had the greatest time. We are so proud of him and we are going to make America great again. We are going to win this in November. We are going to make this country great again. Thank you very much guys. D. 
<TRUMP:> That is my 6""6 boy, and he is a good guy. He is a good guy. He loved this area, he really did. He loved the school he went to. He went to the Hills school. He loved it and he did well. He has been doing well. I am very proud of my children. I am very proud of my children. So, President Obama today was interviewed on a show, man look honestly, if he did a great job as President, I wouldn't care if he was a Democrat, Republican or conservative I don't care. If he did a great job as President, I would be so happy and so would you. I would be so happy. It hasn't worked out that way. It hasn't worked out that way. We are scoffed at all over the world. We are looked down upon all over the world. We are not respected anymore. We were talking about Putin today -- no respect, no like, no nothing. You know, wouldn't it be a great thing if we could get along with Russia? Wouldn't that be a good thing? That would be a good thing. <APPLAUSE> Not a bad thing. It would be a good thing. Wouldn't it be a good thing if we could make deals, trade deals, with China, that instead of loosing hundreds of billions of dollars a year and rebuilding China's roadways, and airports, and tunnels; that we did much better than we are doing right now? You know, I am a free trader. I believe in it, but you need smart people to make great deals. We don't have the right people. We are being ripped off on by every single country we do business with on trade. Every single country we do business with. <APPLAUSE> We have people negotiating our deals that are political hacks. These are deals that are so big -- you know, you could take a midsize country and the trade deals are bigger than the massive deals you read about with corporations. These are bigger deals. There is no bigger deals than the deals with China with trade. It's a one way street. They take their product, they flow it in - by the way, for your steel workers, they dump more steel in this place because they're going to put you out of business. You are already mostly out of business, but they want to put you out of business. We are going to start making things again folks. We are going to start making things again, that includes steel, but we will start making things again.. <APPLAUSE> A friend of mine who's a manufacturer -- he's a great manufacturer. He's not a very political person, which is probably good for him. But he's a great manufacturer. And he calls me up and he goes, you know, it's really sad; I work so hard to get into China; I can't break in. He can't get in. It's so hard. Then he finally gets in and he has to pay massive taxes on everything. And they wanted to open up plants in China -- we're not going to let you do this anymore. And I'm not even blaming China. I think they're doing the right thing for them. But they're killing us. They're killing us. And it's not going to happen anymore, folks; not going to happen anymore. <APPLAUSE> And the problem is it's a one-way street. We pay tax. They don't take our goods. They make us build like crazy over there. You look at Boeing. They order 300 planes. They end up having to build a massive place over there. They devalue their currency. They're grand, grand masters. They're the greatest in the world ever. Japan's good. They're all good. We're not good. We don't know what's happening. And it's so easy to stop. Because they send their goods in and they send them in without tax. And not going to happen. So here's the story, here's the story. I won the state of Indiana, where I got to know Mike Pence. <APPLAUSE> And one of the reasons I won -- well, maybe the biggest reason was Bobby Knight came out and he said, you know, we want Trump. Right? Look at that. We want Trump. But Bobby Knight was so great. But one of the big reasons I won Indiana was because Carrier Air Conditioner announced -- actually about a year before, but I kept talking about Carrier, Carrier. I didn't know I'd need -- you know, it was going to be good for me. It turned out to be good for me. Because every time I made a speech in Indiana, I'd have so many of these 1,400 people that got laid off. They were in Carrier for years; some of them 30, 35 years. Good people. And one day, and if I didn't have the cell phones -- oh, those cell phones where they take the pictures. They had -- it was all over the news. Somebody was taking a picture of this sort of mid-level manager saying, listen, we're going to fire everybody, and we're moving to Mexico. Just another case. <BOOING> But you know what? It's much more effective when you can see it. Let's say that same thing happened, but we didn't have the picture of these people that were devastated. They were devastated. This has been their job for many years and it's a good job. You know, the jobs we have aren't good jobs anymore. They're bad jobs. And even the opponents say they're bad jobs. So I go to Indiana and I've been talking about Carrier for a long time. It got worse and worse. And many others -- this is just -- in all fairness to Carrier, this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of companies that are moving out, in this case going to Mexico. Many of them go to Mexico, but in this case going to Mexico. So they announce they're closing. They're going to fire everybody. They're going to move to Mexico. They're going to make their air conditioners. They're going to sell them over here. And that's it. Not anymore, folks. Not anymore. Not anymore. <APPLAUSE> Not anymore. So now when that happens, and this can pertain to all of you. We're going to keep your companies and we're going to bring a lot of companies back. We're going to bring our jobs back. We're going to bring our coal back. And we're going to have clean coal. It's clean coal. And we're going to have coal. And that gas is going to be just a beautiful thing, OK? Because they want to regulate you right out of business. They want you out. They want to stop that one now. So what happens is this. They think they're going to go make their products, sell it in, everyone's going to be happy. So for years, I've been watching, even before this administration, this beauty of an administration. I've been watching and I've seen that they are always trying to stop people from - they're trying to come up with plans - maybe low interest loans, maybe zero interest loans. I think they made a couple where they actually had the people -- they gave them the money at zero interest or whatever. And then they move, because they forgot to say, ""you can't move, we are giving you money."" This is the people that we owe. So here is the story, here is the story, it's very simple, I'm a free trader. But when trade isn't fair, and when things aren't fair, and when countries disrespect us, we are going to be very firm, very nice. I get along great with leadership, and I don't, again, I'm not angry at the leadership of Mexico or Japan or Vietnam; new strong Vietnam or China. I respect what they're doing in. What they have done is fantastic for them. For us? Horrible. So what we do is simple -- I have watched for many years and it is so basic. Half of the people -- and I know a few of the people here, they're great business people. They are friends of mine. They are friends of mine who came. There's one right over here. Stand up Albert. Where the hell are you Albert? Stand up Albert. He's a good golfer but I'm actually a better golfer than him. Right? I have a lot of friends in the room, great friends. Here is what we are going to do -- they're going to make their products. Here's what they want to do, they want to make their products, send it in, and sell it to Indiana and every other place like nothing happen. There is going to be consequences now. So we tell them, now, if you get there early enough before they build the plant, you say, ""listen, we are really happy you are moving to Mexico. We think it is wonderful. Very hot, but it is wonderful. But here is the story, if you are going to move to Mexico, every single time you make an air conditioning unit we will charge you a 35 percent tax."" Okay? <APPLAUSE> ""We are not going to give you money or loan you money they don't need."" They don't need money, they have plenty of money. This has nothing to do with loans or anything. So all these incentives that our government, which is complicated -- you know loaning money, giving money, and doing tax investments, it's not simple. And I guarantee you -- and I always joke, it is fun for me and I love business. I love it. And I have an instinct for it. I built an unbelievable company, some of the greatest assets in the world. I like it. The only problem is as President I should not be making the call. Right, I joked about this, but I should not be calling the head of an air conditioning company, right, but we have to do it. It's like three minutes. My wife would said, ""you should not be calling the head of Carrier Air Conditioning,"" but I say, ""but honey, I'm telling you it is so easy."" 'I have some of the greatest business leaders in the world to endorse me. Carl Icahn, great business leader and so many others. The reason they listen is because they know what I am doing. And so, what's happen is this, I get a call, okay, the worst, I will have one of my workers <ph> call. One of the people you would not like very much but who cares, you would wouldn't want them out for dinner. Some of them are nice but most are rather ruthless and vicious, but that is who I want negotiating. I don't want our political hacks negotiating, I want these guys. A few I have to do myself because it is fun. So we call then, and he will go, ""yes, Mr. President, it is great honor talk to you."" -- ""It's a great honor to talk to you also. Listen, you're moving, I understand that you are leaving, you are going from Indiana to Mexico, right?"" -- ""Yes""-- ""Well, I hope you change your mind."" -- ""Well sir, we won't."" Now, you have to understand. I will be hit by every lobbyist and every special interest group in America in order to not make the call, in order to let the deal die, like Hillary Rodham Clinton. Hillary Rodham Clinton. So -- crooked Hillary. So -- so look, here's the story. <APPLAUSE> So normally, politicians <ph> -- so they're going to be calling, right? They'll call and they'll talk and they say, you know, this and that and they'll say, ""Madam President."" I don't want to hear that. I do want to hear it eventually because I want to see a woman become president, but it can't be her. She's a disaster. <APPLAUSE> She's a disaster. She'll set you back a long way, women, if that happens. It'll be a long way before it happens again. You better be careful what you wish for. So here's the story. They'd say to Hillary -- they'd say, ""You can't do that. They gave you $2 million."" Or, ""You can't do that. Your lobbyist paid you a fortune and raised millions of dollars."" Or your -- she'll go, ""You're right. I can't really do that."" And that's the end of it, OK? That's the end. So they move to Mexico, they'll sell their goods, we have our 1400 people unemployed, and I'm talking about times thousands, times thousands of jobs, millions of jobs. Million of jobs. Now, here's the difference. Me, they call. ""I don't care."" Who is it? I know half of these guys anyway. I don't care. What do I want to take his call for? OK? Does nothing for me. You know, I spent 60 billion <ph> dollars so far in my campaign, right, 60. And I'm spending -- last week -- last month, I guess it was -- somebody said -- I thought it was two million and they said it was 3.8 million. It's really good when you don't know that it's 3.8, right? <LAUGHTER> No, I thought I put up two <inaudible> something. And I said, oh will you put up two million? It was actually 3.8 million. And I said to myself, you know, it's great when you can put up 3.8 million instead of two million and you don't care. That's the way it is. I don't care. I don't care. <APPLAUSE> And I'm continuing, but I'm raising a lot of money. We're raising a lot of money for the Republican Party and it's coming in big league and it's coming in in small doses and that's something no other Republican's going to be able to do. Mike Pence was just saying it's an amazing thing. We raised like 27 million dollars for a partial month last month and we're doing equally well this month of -- and I think the average price was -- the average cost was like $61 or $64, something like that. And that doesn't happen. That happens for Bernie Sanders because it's a different kind of mentality and thinking. And by the way, poor Bernie. Poor -- he just wants to go home and go to sleep. Please. <LAUGHTER> No. He wants to go to sleep. Who can blame him? Who can blame him? <APPLAUSE> Who can blame him? He wants to go home. Did you see he left very early last night? He's exhausted. But we're going to get the Bernie people out of him, a lot more than people think, because I know the trade. He was right about one thing, trade. He said we're being screwed on trade and he's right. <APPLAUSE> He's right. What's happening with trade is right. I will talk about it a little bit more. Then we're going to talk about the border, we're going to talk about our depleted -- you know, little things. But look, Bernie really hurt his legacy because if he would've gone all the way and if they would've had some kind of a march and then he goes and he goes back to being -- I think it's a lot better than the way he sold out to Hillary Clinton. He sold out. He sold out. <APPLAUSE> I mean, other than trade -- and the problem is he knows trade's no good. The difference is I'll do something about it, big league. Because I like the trade, but we've got to make great deals. Somebody said to me, well, are you a free-trader? Yes. Are you a fair trade? Yes. I'm everything. I could name 10 different forms of trade. I know every one of them. Hey, the Wharton School of Finance right here in this great state, right? But -- but the best school, best school, number one, best school. OK. So, here's the story. So I can name all of them. So one of these characters back here -- look at all of them. You know, for a group of people that said why are you campaigning... <BOOING> ... boy, do we have a lot of people back there. You know what? For a group of people that asked me this morning: Sir, this isn't traditional that you would be out on the stump. Why are you campaigning? Man, a hell of a lot of people showed up for this, didn't they? And look at it. <APPLAUSE> Unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> Unbelievable. Isn't it unbelievable? By the way, I have to tell you, they are the most dishonest human beings you'll ever meet. I really mean it -- the most; the most dishonest human beings you will ever meet. <APPLAUSE> <BOOING> <APPLAUSE> So, especially if you're like a Republican or conservative, it's forget it. It's forget it. These are really bad people. Now, 25 percent of them are fine; 50 percent are not great; and 25 percent are among the worst people you will ever encounter in your life <inaudible>. They lie. They lie. They lie. <APPLAUSE> You know the story where they never show the size of the crowds. They never do it. They never do it. Unless a protest -- you know, I don't have protesters. People are so <inaudible>. I always say the safest place you can be is at a Trump rally. <APPLAUSE> It's the safest place. <APPLAUSE> The safest place. <APPLAUSE> True. True. <APPLAUSE> So, we're going to bring it all back. It's going to all come back. It's going to come back bigger and better than you've ever seen it before. You're going to have jobs flowing in, believe me. You're going to have the Carrier's of the world say I think I'm not going to leave because now we're playing with a different kind of mentality. They're not going to leave. Because they're going to say, ""We're not leaving."" Now, if they want to go to another state, that's different. You've got to all sort of negotiate with each other. Good luck, folks. Good luck -- our congressman. Good luck. But you know, when they start leaving our country for another country, because we're the stupid people, that's not going to happen, OK? That's just not going to happen. So if you look at what's going on right now in a place not so far away, a place that I happen to love called Philadelphia. I love it. You've got people that are fighting and trying to make their point. And they don't know what's happening. Because remember when I ran and everybody said, well, Trump won, like all of these people, all these professional politicians, and some very good people like Ben Carson, who's great; he endorsed me -- great people. <APPLAUSE> But very capable people. And I wrote it down. They have these signs. OK? They haven't mentioned ISIS. They don't want it mentioned. Why? Because they created it. So they don't mention ISIS. I told you before, they don't mention our police or our law enforcement. And they wouldn't have those doors open for two minutes if it weren't for the police. <APPLAUSE> They wouldn't have them open for two minutes. <APPLAUSE> Right? they wouldn't have them open. <APPLAUSE> Their new name, which is the joke of all time, is that crooked Hillary is a change maker. Do you see change? You know, they probably paid $2 million to the guy who came up with that slogan. And I came up with crooked Hillary all by myself. Zero, no money. But change maker -- she's a change maker. So she's been doing this for like 30 years plus and she's going to be a change maker, right? She's not going to change because the special interests and her lobbyists will never ever let her change, believe me. They will never let her change even if she wanted to and she doesn't want to , okay? Look at TPP. So TPP, Transpacific Partnership, right, a horrible deal that she was totally in favor of. She said it was the gold standard not long ago. It's the gold standard of trade deals. Well, remember this. The worst deal ever signed from an economic standpoint in the history of our country, right, it's NAFTA. It was signed by who? Bill Clinton. Who by the way gave a speech last night but he didn't mention my favorite chapter, he left one chapter out. "" I met a girl. I met a girl."" You know, it's funny, when he started the speech last night, he said, ""I met a girl."" and I said, ""that's politically incorrect."" And I saw Rachel Maddow give him hell over that, ""it's not a girl."" But he said it, ""I met a girl,"" and a lot of people thought that was nice. But I said ""watch"", and Rachel Maddow knocked the hell out of him because he said, ""I met a girl"", it's supposed to be ""I met a woman."" I don't know. Maybe we will fight for him on that one, right? And didn't he say, ""I then grabbed her"" and I said, ""this is getting a little crazy now, what's going on?"" --"" I grabbed her ."" And then when he said that, I knew that my favorite chapter would happen . And it didn't happen. He didn't talk about the kinds of things we want to hear about. But what are you going to do? So look, here's the story, they call her a change maker, she's not a change maker. She wants to keep it just the way it is because it's a rigged system. She was very, very disloyal. Now the last person that I like is Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. This person is a disaster. And she has been for a long time. We will take our Reince Priebus any day, right, we will take him. Reince Priebus is a great guy, and he's done a great job. And we had a great convention, and I'll tell you what, Cleveland did a fantastic job. They did a fantastic job. <APPLAUSE> But think of how disloyal Hillary Clinton was to Debbie. Think of it. This was her -- crooked person. This was a dishonest person. This was a person that was rigging the system for her. She rigged the system -- Carson never had a chance. His people never had a chance. I knew that. I was saying -- I'm the one that came up with the term rigged system, and I said it a year and a half ago pertaining to my system. And frankly, had I not won all of these states by massive landslides, I wouldn't be standing here. You'd have some stiff. <APPLAUSE> And there'd be 10 people in the office. You know what? You'd have a different kind of a guy. There'd be about 12 people sitting in the first row. Our two congressmen wouldn't be here. They'd say, ""We don't want to be here."" It'd be a whole different thing and you'd be down 12 points instead of up seven in the state of Pennsylvania, right? <APPLAUSE> Right? That's the way it is. But here's the thing. I'm a loyal person. When Cory <ph> had a problem, I was loyal. I stuck with her. Everyone said Cory <ph> should be fired. Why? I looked at her tape. What happened? I'm a loyal person. OK? I'm a loyal person. You've got to be loyal to people if they do nothing wrong. Now, in her case, she did a lot wrong, but she did it -- you know, she knew. Hillary Clinton knew what she was doing. She knew the system was rigged, as soon as she got caught because the e-mails came out -- and as soon as she got caught, Hillary Clinton said, ""You're fired. Get her out of here. Get her out of here."" That's what we have. It's weakness, it's disloyalty and this woman -- she wanted so hard -- remember, she went the other day in front of the Florida delegation. Oh did they rough her up. But she deserves it. Look, she's a dishonest person. She deserves it. But she rigged the system against Bernie in favor of Hillary and Hillary dumped her like so fast. So fast like I've never seen before. And that's not what it's about. Loyalty can be a wonderful thing, and in this case, I thought it was incredible what happened. Now, the things that were on those e-mails were incredible. You talk about race, religion. Women, by the way, if I ever said the things that are on those e-mails, I would've been run out of town and probably, had I gotten the nomination, I would've been forced to come to Scranton, stand right here and say I'm getting out of the race. They were the worst things and they're trying to sluff <ph> them off. They're trying so hard to sluff <ph> them off. And then I see her campaign manager -- I don't know. Young guy, nice guy, who knows? And he's on television and he said that Russia hacked them. <LAUGHTER> What? No, no. He said Russia hacked them. I'm trying to think of how does he know that, right? So he goes -- I think it was one of the Sunday talk shows, right? And he goes, Russia hacked them. And then goes like -- I said, ""How does he know?"" He didn't really know but he said Russia -- I could -- and then he said, ""Trump. Trump. Yeah Trump."" I'm sitting there watching. I'm saying, ""What did I do? What did I do?"" <LAUGHTER> What did I do? <APPLAUSE> What? ""Trump."" I wish I had that power. Man, that would be power. So he talks about Russia's hacking. The only thing he didn't say is what was on the e-mails was <ph> <inaudible>. That's what the problem is. What was on the e-mails was the horror <ph>. But I'll never forget it. I'm sitting. I'm watching every -- you know, falling asleep. He's a boring guy. <LAUGHTER> And he said Russia with e-mails -- probably was China or somebody else. Might be a 400-pound person sitting in bed. OK? Might be. Some of the greatest hackers of all time. <LAUGHTER> But he said Russia, and then he said Trump. And I -- it reminded me of Jon Lovitz. You ever see the liar Jon Lovitz, right, in Saturday Night Live? ""Yeah, yeah. I went to Harvard. Harvard, that's right."" This was like -- yeah, Russia hacked. Yeah. Yeah, it was Trump. Trump. That's -- I'd say whoa. What? Now, these are lying, bad people, folks. These are bad, bad people. These are bad, bad people. And they're incompetent people. And we want to turn our country around. We want to make great trade deals. We want to have strong borders. We want to have the wall. We want the wall. We're going to have the wall. Because we're going to stop drugs from pouring into our country and people from pouring into our country. <APPLAUSE> We want the wall. <APPLAUSE> All right. I'll give you a quiz. Do you want the quiz? Who's going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico. D. >
<TRUMP:> Who?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico. D. >
<TRUMP:> 100 percent, 100 percent. You know, I have these clowns. And you can hold it -- just, I mean, honestly, you hold me to it. I have these clowns in the back, these pundits. And they're saying, Mexico's never going to pay for the wall; Mexico -- do you know how much money they make from us each year? And I'm not including with the drugs. I'm leaving that out. No. Which really is a terrible thing, because when I won New Hampshire, the New Hampshire people were unbelievable -- my first victory was in New Hampshire. Where, by the way, I hear I have a seven point lead, you know? <APPLAUSE> You know, I've got to tell you. It's funny. I have people, politicians, they're running. And some of them embraced me, like these two characters, OK? But some of them said, oh, Trump, he's too controversial. And then I run. I don't care if they -- you know, if they endorse me or not, it doesn't make any difference to me. I think I do better -- I might do better without endorsements. But I have states -- the great Rob <ph>. Stand up, Rob. Will you please? Take a bow for two seconds. <APPLAUSE> So, and if I don't win this state, you'll never be standing up again. <LAUGHTER> That I can do. Mike? You better believe it. So I have these politicians, and they're running. You know, they're senators. And they say, no, no, we don't want anything to do with Trump; <inaudible> controversial. Do you endorse? Well, we support him, please don't ask me that question. Then the poll comes out where I'm leading that senator, whoever it may be, by a hell of a lot. And all of a sudden, we love Mr. Trump; he's great for America. This is what we deal with, folks. OK? This is what we deal with. But in New Hampshire, I've got a nice lead, supposedly. I mean, a poll came out, seven points, eight points, more -- something like that; a very good lead. We're doing well. We're doing well in states. And remember this, if a person on the stage with me, and I speak well of all of them now, because it would be nice if the party unified. I don't think it matters from my standpoint. I really don't. I don't think it matters, but it would be nice. I don't know why, but it would be nice, because we have to win. But I will say this. We open up states, meaning me, meaning you. You know, we're together. I'm a messenger. I'm a messenger. That's all I am. Believe me. Believe me. <APPLAUSE> I'm a messenger. <APPLAUSE> It's what I am. That's what I am. You know, I was using this phrase for the last couple of months, and I use it again: America first. I use another one -- but I use another one. I use another one: the forgotten man. Now, I have to add ""and woman,"" but there is an whole thing going around. It's called the forgotten man. It's the forgotten men and women. We have forgotten men and women who work hard, who are making less money than they made 18 years ago, who are working much harder than they worked 18 years ago, and now their older. They can't afford their health insurance - who hate looking at what's happening. They can't stand the fact that a priest in France has his throat cut and he lies dying on the ground. They can't stand the fact that we are letting thousands, and thousands, and thousands of people pour into our country from areas of the world. We are going to have problems like you've never seen, I am very good at prognostication, folks, you're seeing that everything I've said has all come true pretty much. And Hillary Clinton wants 550 percent more than Obama -- of people coming in from that area of the world. We don't have documentation, we don't have paperwork, we don't really know who they are. I've spoken to the best law enforcement people in this country and they say, ""there is really no way of saying who they are and where they come from,"" okay? They even stole our passport machine, did you see that? They stole our passport machine some of people, they're going to cause problems. And with me, we're going to do safe zones, were going to help people. Were going to get the Gulf states to pay because I don't want to pay. With our country, we are $19 trillion -- and is going to be $21 trillion very soon . We are going to build safe zones, and we are going to get the Gulf states that we protect, they wouldn't be there -- they have nothing but money and they're going to pay for this. And we are going to build them in Syria and were going to take care of people. But you know what? We're not going to pay for it because we can't pay for it. This isn't 40 years ago, this isn't 20 years ago, this is now. And we are going to make our country so strong, and were going to re-negotiate our military deals. You know, I'm taking a lot of heat where they say, ""NATO"" , all I said is, ""we have many countries, there are 28 countries in NATO, right? There are five that are paying their way."" The others -- you don't get it straight. They say back there, ""Donald trump doesn't like NATO."" Well, I think it's great, I just said, ""it was obsolete."" Wolf Blitzer on CNN asked me a question. He's fine. He said, ""what do you think of NATO""? You have to understand, I have been a businessman but I have good common sense in business. And so, I said, ""NATO is obsolete because it's not covering terrorism."" And everybody smiled and laughed, and thought it was funny, three days later they are now saying, ""Trumps right, It's not covering terrorism"" And then a few weeks later, check out the Wall Street Journal. A few weeks later-- front page says, ""NATO to open up terrorism division."" I said, ""great."" --and to appoint the great guys, one of their good guys, who knows. Who the heck knows if he's any good? We need your help, father. So that was right. Then I said the second thing so I said, ""it's obsolete,"" so they're working on that. I like it, I think NATO is fine, but we have to adjust. You can't go so many years with no adjustments, so now they have that. I also said because I heard this, that people aren't paying their fair share, they're not paying their way. And then these stupid people, they say, ""but we have a treaty."" They said, ""what would happen if Russia or somebody attacks?"" I said, "" I don't know. Have they paid? Have they paid? Have they paid tell me? Have they paid. Well, they haven't paid. Well they said, ""we have a treaty."" Well, I said, ""they have a treat too that they have to pay."" We are going to end up in World War III protecting people - and these people can't pay. We are going to protect them -- and there's an article right here that says -- cover, Trump is right. Five countries out of 28 are paying their way. So I want them to pay. And here's the story: they will pay if asked by the right person. They'll pay. They'll pay. And Hillary Clinton said, ""We will protect our allies at all costs."" Well, how the hell can you get money if you're going to say that? And we need money. We have massive, massive deficits. We need money. <APPLAUSE> We need money. So it sounds cold, it sounds terrible. And then tonight, you'll listen to Obama saying, ""Donald Trump wants to give up NATO."" He doesn't say it right. I want to keep NATO, but I want them to pay. I don't want to be taken advantage of. We don't want to be the stupid people anymore, OK? <APPLAUSE> We don't want to be the stupid people anymore. We're protecting countries that most of the people in this room have never even heard of and we end up in world war three and the country -- you know, just come on. Give me a break. Now, if they live up to their obligations, as they should -- and by the way, if they do that, they'll have more spirit in a certain way. OK? But they have to pay. Same thing with Japan and Germany. Can you believe -- a lot of people -- before I ran, did anybody know that we were protecting and paying for a large portion of the protection of Japan, which sells us cars by the millions and Germany and Saudi Arabia and South Korea? We sort of knew because we have 20,000 soldiers on the border. So I said here it is. You've got to pay -- got to pay. So I talk about Japan. Love Japan. Many friends in Japan. Great country. They sell us cars. I mean, you talk about rip-offs. You want to see a trade imbalance? We sell them wheat, they sell us cars. We sell them beef and they don't even take the beef because their farmers say, ""We don't want American beef,"" right? Even though it's the greatest beef in the world, they don't want it. They don't want it. <APPLAUSE> So we sell them beef, they sell us cars. It's the greatest trade imbalance. You've got to see it. It's like the floor is us, the ceiling is Japan. We're not doing anything about it. We don't do -- but on top of it, we protect Japan. So a general gets on, sent obviously by Obama, and he said, ""Mr. Trump doesn't understand. He knows nothing about defense."" I know more about offense and defense than they will ever understand, believe me. Believe me. Than they will ever understand. Than they will ever understand. <APPLAUSE> So I said -- and this is a general. Now, if he says this number, it's actually lower. He said, ""Doesn't he understand that Japan pays for 50 percent of its production and its -- of the work we do?"" OK. They pay for 50 percent of the defense that we give them, of the military protection that we give them. So the newspaper calls up and they say, ""Mr. Trump, sir, they pay for 50 percent of the military."" I say, ""Why aren't they paying for 100 percent of their -- why?"" <APPLAUSE> And the reporter goes, ""Oh, never thought of that."" They don't think of that stuff. And Germany. Who has a Mercedes? Half the people in the room <inaudible>. But look... <LAUGHTER> But look, Germany. Now, I don't mind and I understand all the reasons why and we don't want them to arm and all that stuff. But you know, the man that we know so well who's always threatening everybody in the region, North Korea, if he all of a sudden gets a little more frisky than just words, we end up in a massive war protecting somebody. Now, here's our treaty with Japan. Again, I love Japan. I respect Japan. I respect what they've been able to negotiate. I think it's great. But here's our treaty with Japan. If they get attacked, we have to protect them, essentially world war three, right? If we get attacked, they don't have to do anything. OK? They don't have to do anything. No good. No good. Then they'll say, Donald Trump -- you'll hear it tonight; they have all these guys lined up -- Donald Trump doesn't know about -- I know so much. Now, if we... <APPLAUSE> And I actually saw it today on television. I saw a couple of people. They called me -- one guys calls me -- he's a teacher at a big college: Could I come up to your office with my students? I said, oh, this is just what I want. Oh, I'm so busy. He comes up. I treat him nice. It's a while ago -- comes up, treat him nice, take pictures with all these students. Yeah, yeah, yeah <ph>. Goes back. Then I see him on television today -- I know nothing about -- because I cannot tie the fact that they're not paying into the -- why? Why? Am I right? I mean, you know, give me a break. So, people agree with me, but they don't tell you the story. A lot of them said, headlines, Donald Trump doesn't like NATO; he wants to get out of NATO. They don't say what we're talking about. So when they hear what they're talking about, everybody says, you know, you're right. So right in a headline, in a major newspaper two days ago, five countries out of 28 are paying their way. The rest of them aren't. Some are paying nothing. Because there's nobody to ask them. There's nobody to ask them. So we're not going to be the stupid country anymore. We're not going to be led by stupid people anymore. And we're going to do such... <APPLAUSE> I mean, think of this. I had a moment where I said we're going to renegotiate NAFTA. Everyone said, oh, that's terrible. I -- what's wrong with renegotiating, right? We're going to renegotiate the NAFTA deal. It's draining our jobs <inaudible>. Everyone said, oh, Donald Trump wants to renegotiate; he's against free trade. I just want good deals. That's all I want. But all I want is good deals. Call him whatever you want, right? But there was a big story -- Donald Trump is going to renegotiate NAFTA; isn't that terrible? I said, let me ask you a question. So, I'm a good negotiator. So we get in a room with these folks. I tell them pretty tough stories because I mean it. Because you always have to be prepared to walk. You have to be. You cannot go into a negotiation unless you're prepared to walk. I'm prepared to walk from a bad deal as a bad deal anyway. So I'm prepared. You guys are I guarantee it prepared to walk. You've lost half of your businesses. I mean, I'm not going to go into it, but I look at Scranton -- Pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs. Right? Look at these numbers. Look at these numbers. Look at these numbers. Scranton has lost 43 percent of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA. It's not -- this is just -- 43 percent of your manufacturing jobs. So I don't think you'll be hard to convince. I mean, you're smart people. But look, why would anybody be upset about wanting to renegotiate deals, make them better. Why would anybody care? So I say I want to renegotiate NAFTA. And every -- the newspapers -- <inaudible> the newspapers, they say, that's terrible. And I'm trying to figure out why. They have the National Review and some of these conservative groups -- he wants to renegotiate this. He says we're losing a fortune on these deals. So if I negotiate these deals, and I make them from bad deals to good deals and maybe even great deals, why would anybody be upset? They're upset about it. I don't get it. But I don't care because I'll do it. OK? I'm going to do it. But -- but nobody understands. Now, today or yesterday, Hillary Clinton said, first time ever in her life, right? ""I am going to renegotiate trade deals."" Not one mention of my name in the article. Not one mention. Not one mention. TPP, gold standard, right? She had the gold standard. She then saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because they don't -- they don't talk about currency manipulation and devaluation. They don't talk about many of the problems. Plus, you know what? I want to make a deal not a massive number of countries. I want to make a deal one-on-one, individual countries. Nice and simply. Nice and simple. Nice and simple. <APPLAUSE> One, two, three. You we don't like. You're bad. Four, fix. No good. Six. These deals are so complicated. So it's a 5,000-page document that the only people in Congress that read are our two congressmen. And I promise you, they didn't read them either. OK? Don't worry. <APPLAUSE> So this is a 5,000-page document that nobody read. Remember Obamacare? Remember when Obama came out, it was thousands of pages and they went to Congress and nobody read it? And then, you had the wise guy from one of the good schools and he said it was a con job. He said it was a con job and everybody was going to just go after that guy. And you know what happens? A couple of weeks go by, they'll forget. But I remember and I -- I will bring it up. Remember the guy? He said that Obamacare was a con job. Remember that? It was all a big con. And two weeks go by and they -- sort of fades, and then four weeks go by it's over. But it's not over with me. So here's the thing. I want to do individual countries because what happens is when you do a lot of countries, number one, too complicated. You have all -- you've got to see the lines on this thing. I looked at it -- 5,000 pages. You've got to see the things. It's here, here, here. It's like the craziest thing. Impossible. And if the country -- one of the countries is bad, you can't get out because it's such a complicated web. I want to make trade deals with individual countries. Nice and simple. Nice and beautiful. Nice and beautiful. <APPLAUSE> And if the country misbehaves or takes advantage of us, like they always do, we just send them a notice. ""Sorry, here's your 25-day notice."" OK? We're breaking off -- and you know what they'll do? They'll call up and -- ""What do we have to do to keep it going?"" OK? We'll make a better deal. It's what we do. So look. Folks, we are going to make this country so strong again. We're going to build up our military; it's totally depleted. We're going to build a wall. We're going to take care of our veterans. Our veterans are our great people. We're going to take care of our veterans. <APPLAUSE> We're going to take care of our vets. They've been forgotten. So many people have been forgotten. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I just ask you this one thing. I didn't need this and neither do you. Sitting in this room is about 200 degrees. OK? The only good thing is you lose a lot of weight. <LAUGHTER> But look, what I ask you is this. You have to go November 8th and you have to vote or we've just all wasted our time. <APPLAUSE> This is a movement, but it's only really a movement if we win. I -- I tell the story a lot about people that tell me what you've done has never been done in politics before and all that stuff. I say no, it doesn't mean anything. If I knew that I wasn't going to win, I wouldn't even waste my time doing it. I wouldn't waste my time. They said, ""No, no. In terms of history, what you've done has never been done."" I said, ""It doesn't mean a thing unless we win."" OK? Doesn't mean a thing because we can't do what we're going to do. <APPLAUSE> And it's so simple. We're going to make thing fair. We're going to make things fair. So I only asks you one thing. Get every person you know. We have to win the state of Pennsylvania. And I can't believe she has many fans here. <APPLAUSE> I can't believe she has many fans here. I don't believe she has many fans here. And the miners and the steel workers and the executives and the professors, we've got them all. We have to get out there. We have to vote. We can't sit back because this is a really vital state. And you're going to see because she's got a billion dollars to blow and she'll put on these crazy ads, much of which is wrong. I'd go into it, but I don't want to even bother. But they're wrong. They're false. But she's going to put on all these ads, and you know what? They're false ads. Thank you, darling. I love you, too. Look at her. I love them. <APPLAUSE> But look. Look. Thank you. She's going to put ads. You know, when I was running in Florida, I won in a landslide. I went through two weeks of ads. I was down there. I said this is the most incredible thing I've ever seen. You couldn't see -- I was dying to see an ivory soap ad... <LAUGHTER> But there wasn't, because Trump was -- all negative ads and I won in a massive landslide. So somehow, people understand the truth because they're really phony ads and false ads and vicious. But here's the story. Come November 8th, you have to get out and vote because it is a movement and it's a movement like nobody's seen. They're talking about it all over the world. We're on the cover of Time Magazine every two hours. Many covers of Time Magazine because of what's happened. And you know, my whole life, I've been on Time Magazine I think a couple of times. My whole life. Not so bad. And the last number of months, I think it's six or seven times, right? That's pretty good. So you tell me. What's more important, real estate or politics, right? But what really is more important is making America great again, and that's what we're going to do. <APPLAUSE> I love you. Thank you very much. Get out and vote November 8th. I love you. Thank you. Thank you. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-01"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I have to tell you that the fire marshall -- they turned away thousands of people, they turned away -- thank you very much. They turned away thousands of people -- look at the size of this place. They turned away thousands, they were giving orders that no more than a thousand people. Now, Hillary Clinton, I have a picture here which is pretty sad. <LAUGHTER> She had, she had, last week or a couple of days ago, look at -- totally empty. <LAUGHTER> But is the mayor a Democrat? Is there a Democrat over here? That's what I heard. He ought to be ashamed of himself. They turned away thousands of people, but that makes it better for you, right? <APPLAUSE> It's very sad. You know. It shouldn't be so much about politics, folks. We're gonna do a town hall so we're gonna be talking about questions and this and that. I'll say a few words. But outside, I met two gentlemen from Piketon who really were misrepresented very badly, very badly, by President Obama and they're gonna come up. Come up fellas. I just met them. <APPLAUSE> Because we're gonna bring back our jobs, we're not gonna let our jobs go to Mexico and all these other countries, we're gonna renegotiate the horrible NAFTA deal which is maybe the worst deal every made from an economic development standpoint -- I'm not just talking in this country I'm talking about in the world -- we're gonna bring back our jobs. And we're also gonna stop radical Islamic terrorism. We're not letting the people come in. We're not letting them come in. And they can play all the games they want. But we're not -- you know Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase from Syria coming into this country over Obama. And you'd actually say what is she doing? So here's a letter from President Obama to these two gentlemen that have worked so hard and are having a hard time, and maybe in just a little while you could just say exactly what's going on.
<UNKNOWN: Thank you. (APPLAUSE) My name is Jeff Albrecht (ph). I'm from Portsmouth, Ohio. We have a plant just north of Portsmouth in Piketon that enriched uranium and for seven years Kevin and I have been going to Washington and talking to politicians about saving the plant that enriched uranium. There were hundreds of jobs there and it was the only plant in the United States that enriched uranium. I also have the hotel, the Holiday Inn in Portsmouth, and then- Senator Barack Obama,who was running for president, came and stayed at my hotel. And he said, ""I'm gonna get up at 5 o'clock in the morning and I need breakfast but you're not open yet."" So I says, ""All right. Two things. You have to promise me something and you have to get your picture taken with me."" So I fixed him six eggs, six strips of bacon, a big pile of home fried potatoes, four whole wheat toast and a big bowl of oatmeal and I asked him, ""How do you eat all that?"" ""Only meal I'll get today."" So he had his picture taken with me, lived up to that promise, then I said, ""We have this plant in Piketon that we want to continue enriching uranium. Lots of employees, we need the government help and we need the old site cleaned up. How do you feel about that project in Piketon?"" And the man looked me in the eye, he says, ""I support the Piketon project."" So I want to thank Donald Trump. He's here in Ohio and I don't know him personally, but I feel like he's the man that if he says, ""I'm gonna do something,"" I'm gonna do it. So let's all support Donald Trump. Kevin, go ahead.>
<UNKNOWN: The only thing I've got to say is when these politicians, they promised to us, that somebody holds them accountable. And that's it. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Thank you both very much. Same old stuff, politicians. All talk, no action, won't happen. And you know Hillary will be nothing more than four more years of Obama. Four more years of ISIS. Four more years of a military that's being depleted and not taking care of our vets. She said a few months ago our vets are being taken care of just fine. She said, ""No, no, it's over-exaggerated, I know the vets. I think I have tremendous support with the vets."" Raised a lot of money and gave a lot of money to the vets. I will tell you something. The vets are not being taken care of well at all. The suicide rate is hard to believe, even, when you hear the numbers and you know the numbers I'm talking about. They wait in line for two, three, four, five days -- think of it, going to a doctor and waiting for five days -- longer than that -- and people are dying waiting in line. SO we're gonna take care of our vets. We're going to again secure, and very important, we're gonna secure our borders. We're gonna secure our borders.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We're gonna build the wall. We're gonna build the wall and Mexico's gonna pay for the wall. And the reason -- some of the politicians have said, you know they're not going to pass it. No, no, you don't understand. They're going to pay. They are making so much money, Mexico -- they're taking our business -- a friend of mine builds plants, that's what he does, plants. If he had to build an apartment, he wouldn't know where to begin, but he builds massive plants, among the biggest in the world. And I said to him recently, how are you doing? He said, unbelievable. Now he's from this country, and he'd like to do well in this country. But I said, how are you doing? He said, unbelievable. I said, that's good. So you're doing a lot of work in the United States? Not so much. I said, well how are you doing unbelievably? You wouldn't believe what's happening in Mexico. It's the eighth wonder of the world, that's what he told me. I said, what does that mean? He said, they're building among the biggest plants we've ever built. It's unbelievable. Companies are moving out of the United States -- Columbus, by the way -- they're moving out of the United States, they're moving out of Ohio, I asked him, they're moving out of Michigan, big league <ph> the cars -- he builds car plants. He builds computer plants. Builds them all. And they're moving out of the United States. So I said, how's the United States doing? He says, not so good. He said, but Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world. That's going to end, folks. We want Mexico to do fine, but we're not going to let them take our jobs anymore. We're not going to let it happen. You look at this area, I mean, I have statisticians, right -- good statisticians -- they love to do this. I can't imagine doing it and being too much fun. To me, it would be a little bit boring to do. But I'll tell you, the numbers are horrendous. First of all, I don't know if you just saw the number for growth of our country. Did you see that? Growth -- 1.2 percent. 1.2 percent! We're sinking. We're sinking. That's one of the lowest numbers ever. I think it's the lowest number ever in terms of trying to make a comeback. 1.2 percent. But in Columbus -- and I looked at this, and this is bad, this is bad -- Ohio has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed it. And Hillary Clinton wants it <ph>. Think of that. Hillary Clinton's disastrous trade policies are responsible for the manufacturing job losses in Ohio and throughout the other states of this country. I've got <ph> a machine. And I'll tell you, the problem with a machine, it totally controls the press. You look at CNN, it's called the Clinton news network. All day long, Trump, Trump -- all day long, CNN, Trump, Trump, such a bad guy. I just want to bring back your jobs. I want to bring back your safety. Because we're not safe. 550 percent more people coming in from Syria and other territories, and we have no idea who they are. And I've gone to the best law enforcement officials and they said there's no way of you telling, they have all sorts of false things. You know, they stole our passport machine, you saw that. They make passports better than we do, OK. They have -- think of it, 550 percent more than -- Obama, he's letting in thousands and thousands of people. The people in Ohio, the people in the rust belt -- and they call it the rust belt for a reason, because everything's rusting and rotting. You lost your jobs. They're moving to Mexico. Remember my friend with the plant. When you're going to vote, remember this, November 8 -- when you go to vote, remember my friend with the plant, where he says it's the eighth wonder of the world. And we're going to renegotiate -- if you want, unless you don't want to do this. We're going to renegotiate NAFTA, and it was very funny. The other day, I saw Hillary Clinton saying -- first time ever -- we are going to start renegotiating our trade deals. That's been me for years. That's been me. Number one, she won't do a good job of it, for a lot of reasons, but one of them is that she's totally controlled by the special interests. And I'll give you an example. I just saw this number. Just read it coming up here. Donald Trump has raised $19,000 from hedge funds. Now I don't know how it got in there. I don't even want it. I'll send it back. Hillary Clinton, from hedge funds, has raised $48.5 million. Think about it. $48.5 million. I hope you don't own -- I have a friend, he's very wealthy. He doesn't own a hedge fund. But raised 48.5 million -- I have 19,000. I think I'll send the 19,000 back. Probably a nice person, but think of it. But here's really what's important to me. So I funded, as you know, my primary. People were very happy. I'm continuing to fund my general election. But we're also taking small donations, which in the primary wasn't a big factor because we didn't really -- we sold hats and things, little things, it was cute and people like it and people put in small money. But I funded it, and I guess I'm into everything for 60 million or over 60 million or soon will be over 60 million, but I'm continuing to fund my campaign. But we're also raising money from people where they send in a check, small donors, right. You've sent in a check? Who sent in a check? Wow. Whoa. That's fantastic. So, we only started last month, and she's going to have like a fortune. She's going to have like a billion, billion and a half, because she's going to be totally controlled. Like we talk about uranium <ph>, the two gentlemen, great people -- well, she had a lot to do with Russian uranium. You saw that deal. And got paid a fortune for allowing Russia to come in -- talk about uranium, that's big stuff, OK. Got paid a fortune. And we'll be talking about that during the campaign, don't worry about it. But -- so we started, really, around the middle of June, and we had a tremendous June, and they were saying, Donald Trump didn't raise any money. Well, we didn't start. We started in the middle of June, and we raised, I think it as $27 million from the small donors. That was around 60 some odd dollars apiece. And we also raised, from other people, about -- I don't know, the total was about $51 million, OK. That was in June. We hardly -- that was like for half a month. Because people want to see something happen with our country. But here's what's really good news. This is just going to be reported, I think, today or tomorrow. We have raised, with the small donor, $35.8 million. Think of that. I believe it's 517,000 donors. Think of that. That's in a month.
<TRUMP:> So we raised 35.8 million, even a little more than that, and the average price of the donation was $69. How incredible is that, right? <APPLAUSE> And it's not even to me the money. It's to me the concept -- in all fairness, Bernie Sanders was doing that, you know? Because there was some movement, now, it was a movement on the other side of the plate. But you know what? He had one thing in common with me. He knew that the trade deals are destroying our country. The difference is he couldn't do anything about the trade deals. I'll take those trade deals and make them so good that's what I do. I love taking bad deals and making them good, that's what I do. I take bad deals and make them good; NAFTA's a bad, bad, bad deal. And I'm gonna make it good. <APPLAUSE> But think of that. So we raised $35.8 million, an excess of that in a month. And then in addition we raised money that hasn't been tabulated yet from people that are putting up larger numbers. But that's going to the Republican National -- largely -- to the Republican National Committee and -- I'm -- and I'm putting up money to run my campaign, OK? So when you see -- when you see that Clinton, crooked Hillary, crooked -- she's crooked as a three dollar bill, let me tell ya. She is crooked. When you see crooked Hillary with $48.5 million from hedge funds and Trump at $19,000, when they call me because they wanna stop a company from doing something or when they call me because they want one of your companies to get the green light to move into Mexico and fire everybody, believe me I'm gonna take care of these -- I'm gonna do what's right for you. She's gonna do right for her donors. I'm gonna do right for you so it's gonna be a big difference. <APPLAUSE> It's gonna be a big difference. So -- so I'll just tell you, we're battling a lot of things. But we're battling the press because the press is very dishonest, OK? The press is very dishonest. So -- so as an example, as an example I gave a very good answer over the weekend to one of the shows <ph> on Russia going into the Ukraine. I said very simply they're not gonna do it on my watch, essentially. I said Russia will not go into the Ukraine, now I said that. And the next day, the story comes out and we really let it roll a little bit. Actually, I think it was USA Today; a couple of them covered it accurately, what I said. But a couple of paper said Donald Trump doesn't realize that the Crimea was already taken. I know it exact -- two years ago, approximately OK? Approximately. It was taken during Obama's watch. So when I said believe me, Russia's not going into Ukraine, all right? They're not going into Ukraine. The person said but they're already in Ukraine. I said yeah well, that was two years ago, that's -- that's -- I mean you wanna go back? You wanna have World War III to get it back? That was during Obama's watch. So during Obama's watch -- you know all the tough guys statements, right? So he talks about Donald Trump is not strong on Russia. First of all, I have to say this. Wouldn't it be great if we actually got along with Russia? Am I wrong in saying that? Wouldn't it be great? <APPLAUSE> OK? You know Russia, like us, has nuclear weapons folks. It would be really nice if we got along with Russia and others that we don't get along with right now and wouldn't it be nice if we teamed up with Russia and others, including surrounding states and maybe NATO and we knocked the hell out of ISIS and got rid of these people? <APPLAUSE> Wouldn't that be nice? Right? <APPLAUSE> But -- but even beyond that, even beyond that Putin said some very good things about me, people say, ""Oh, Trump's going to be weak with Putin,"" because Putin is saying nice things about me. OK, all right.
<TRUMP:> And I said he's a strong guy. They immediately say, ""Oh, Trump likes"" -- but, look, I don't like or dislike. I just say it this way. Wouldn't it be great if the United States and Russia got along, combined, knocked out ISIS, maybe did other positive things? You know, we forced them through stupidity into an alliance with China. You know why? Because of oil. Because China needs oil. We were driving both crazy. They formed -- and from the time I was young guy, I've always learned, don't ever let China and Russia get together -- we forced them together. Obama forced them together. Because you didn't get along with either and they eventually -- China came in and said, ""let's make a deal on oil."" They're together. In fact, they're doing naval exercises together someplace. And you look at China, they're building one of the largest military installations in the world right smack in the middle of the South China Sea. And then they talk about Donald Trump and Russia, or Donald Trump, but -- believe me, folks, somebody can say nice things about me -- he did call me a genius but these are minor details -- somebody can say nice things about me -- it has -- it makes no difference. It makes no difference. All right? I have been dealing a long time. A lot of times I will make much better deals with people that say terrible things about me. I don't care what they say about me; I want the deal. You know, on trade, one of the people that's standing back there -- one of the dishonest media -- ""well, what's your definition of trade?"" I said, ""well, your fair trade -- you have all sorts -- you have so many different types of trade."" But here is my definition of trade. Because right now we are being ripped off -- $500 billion trade deficit with China -- $500 billion. And they give us product, we let them in, no tax, no nothing. You want to try and make a deal with China? You can't get your product in, and if you do you pay tax, and if you do you also have to build plants over there. And they don't even want that; they don't want you in. They're one-sided deals. So when they said, ""what's your trade deal?"" I said very simply, ""I want to make great deals for the United States."" We don't have to name it. You have fair trade. You have all sorts of names. I learned every single one of them in college. Now we have added a couple. Here is the problem. We have stupid people doing our negotiating. We have stupid people doing our negotiating. I'll give you an example. If a company in Ohio said they're going to leave, we're going to fire -- which as you know, many companies are leaving -- and by the way, as you are sitting here right now -- right now, we have companies negotiating with Mexico and other places to close up in Ohio and to move into Mexico or other places. OK? As you're sitting here right now. Some of you people think you have good jobs. Guess what? Carrier thought they had good jobs, Ford thought they had good jobs; lots of <ph> -- hundreds and hundreds -- thousands of companies have left -- thousands. Millions of jobs. And Hillary Clinton is weak and she is ineffective and there is no way you can allow four more years of this stuff to go on. There's just no way in my opinion.
<TRUMP:> But let's say -- and by the way, your steel mills in Ohio where China is dumping steel to put you guys out of business -- they're dumping -- you know that? Who's in steel over here? Am I right? They're dumping steel to put the steelworkers out of business. And Hillary said the miners -- any miners in here? Miners? I love the miners. Oh, West Virginia was good to me, I'll tell you. And Ohio was good to me. A lot of miners in Ohio. Miner. But Hillary Clinton said, ""We're going to put the miners and the mines out of business."" Now, she said that before probably an environmental group or something, but then she tried to back up. But they remembered she said it and she got clobbered in West Virginia. Smart people. She got clobbered in West Virginia. So, we're going to have clean coal, and we're going to have steel, and we're going to make our products again <ph>, and we're going to have the people in Columbus and all of Ohio and all of Michigan and all of these other states -- you know, I did great in Michigan. I did great in Ohio, too. Unfortunately I didn't have a long time to campaign. If I would have spent two more days here, I would have won Ohio too, because I won practically everything else. We got almost 14 million votes. Think of that. More than anybody in the history of Republican primaries. That includes some great people like Ronald Reagan, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who won the Second World War, right, he did win the Second World War. Got elected because he won the Second World War. I got more votes than him, that's good, right? And remember this, I had 17 people. I wasn't running against two people. I had 17 people. Hillary Clinton, I got a similar number to Hillary Clinton, and she had Bernie, and she had a hard time putting Bernie away. And Bernie -- poor Bernie. He looked so upset. You know what, he made a mistake. He shouldn't have made a deal. Sometimes -- he lost, he lost. First of all, it was rigged, and I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest. Because I think my side was rigged -- if I didn't win by massive landslides -- I mean, think of what we won in New York and Indiana, California, 78 percent. That's with other people in the race. But think of it. I hear more and more that the election on November 8 -- can you believe, we're almost there. This started on June 16 of last year and I said, wow, let's go do it. Takes guts to do this, believe me. And everybody said -- no, it takes guts. I could be having a very nice life right now. I don't have to be with you people, ranting and raving. Could have a very nice life. But it takes guts. And everybody said, this is the greatest field. I remember Charles Krauthammer saying, this is the greatest field ever assembled in the history of Republican politics, or something to that effect. This is before I got in. And I said to my wife, you know, it's a great field. Charles Krauthammer and others are saying this is the greatest field ever assembled. It's also the largest field ever assembled. So I have the greatest, largest field ever assembled. And then one day, I just, I had it. I watched the Iran deal, this horrible deal be done, where we give back $150 billion and they're making nuclear weapons, and we've made a power out of Iran. They were struggling for their life and we've made a power out of Iran. In fact, they were in serious trouble, when they were all marching in the streets, it was over, and Obama came to their rescue, if you remember that. First term. That was a bad day. That was going to be over for them, and we came to their rescue. Now we've made them into a power, OK. A big power. But I saw the Iran deal and I saw the stupidity on trade, where companies are leaving -- one of them was, Carrier left Indiana. 1,400 people fired, moving to Indiana, they're going to make their plant, they're going to build it, they're going to take their air conditioners, make them, sell them right back into Indiana and other places, no tax, no nothing. With me, they're going to be taxed 35 percent and you know what? They're never going to move. They're never moving, folks. They're never moving. Did you ever see -- because I love this stuff. You know, people say, not a politician. Remember when they said a certain person? Well, he got clobbered. Raised tremendous amounts of money, and everybody thought he'd do really well. But they say -- but he hasn't been an active politician for eight years. I've never been a politician, and we've won in a landslide. So -- but I don't get credit for that. They don't give me credit. What are you going to do? I was joking -- I was joking, because some people thought I was a little bit too tough -- and I have been -- certain people that I ran against in the Republican primaries have never come back. And they probably won't. And that's OK. I do better when they don't come back. I do better if I have them as my opponent as opposed to my ally. No, no, but we have a few. You know their names. We have a few. They haven't come back. They haven't come back. I'll tell you, I was honored at the convention for two reasons. Number one, I had 35 million people watching. Hillary had what, 28 million people, this final speech, so we had more people watching. The press built up that convention like it was the greatest Democrat Convention -- I actually thought -- I liked the Republican Convention. I would rather watch -- I would rather watch Ivanka Trump than any of their celebrities, I can tell you. I would rather watch Don and Eric and Tiffany and Melania did a great job. I would rather watch them than any of their celebrities. You know, they all said, well Donald Trump had his kids -- isn't that nice if you have kids that are capable enough to go up and do it? You know why people haven't had their kids go up? Because their kids can't do it. And I can understand that. That's a hard thing to do. My kids went up, they were brave, they were strong. Tiffany, we pushed her out on the stage, go. She never did it before. Tiffany said, this is really scary, and we just said, just go do it, and she did beautifully. She never spoke to anybody -- it's true. The biggest group she's ever spoken to is like 18 people in a class, where she was a very good student, I have to say. But they did a great job. But I actually liked the Republican National Convention better -- I'll tell you what. We had a much better looking stage, number one, which is important. We won for stage <ph>. But we got a very unfair press. When Bernie Sanders had his people leaving the room, nobody covered that. If I would have had people leave the room, it would have been a national scandal. When a certain man got up -- and I knew his speech. I said, look, let him speak, what difference does it make? And -- he says -- a certain man got up and he spoke, and everybody in the room booed the hell out of him. In fact, I saved his life when I walked back into the room. But everybody in the room -- and his numbers went down like from 68 to 20- something. That's called unity, folks. That's unity. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. That is unity. And -- but the problem we have -- the biggest problem we have, I think, is the press. ""The New York Times"" is totally dishonest. Totally dishonest. ""The Washington Post,"" gotten a little bit better lately, I took away their press credentials. I should do it with ""The Times,"" but -- the problem is, you get more publicity from doing -- just let them rot. But ""The New York Times"" is really, really dishonest, and it's failing. I don't think they'll be in business more than two or three years. Look at their numbers. They're failing. But they do a number that's unbelievable. Every story is bad.
<TRUMP:> In fact, sometimes I'll say, oh, great. This was so good, I'm going to have a great story tomorrow in ""The New York Times."" You know, they'll call. Always turned out to be a disaster. They -- it's so dishonest. And yet Hillary. Hillary. Crooked Hillary they write beautifully about. Right? Washington Post, similar. It was really bad, now it's gotten a little bit better I must tell you. Washington Post got a little bit better. CNN is so dishonest. Clinton News Network, so dishonest. Unbelievable. Do you know what they call it? It may be the Clinton News Network, but nobody wants to watch Hillary. All day long, it's Trump. All day, all the time. That's what it is. But it's so much inaccurate information. And by the way I think their ratings are going to go down really sharply now. They've been asking me to go on for months. I won't do their shows. And the reason I won't is because it's so dishonest that until they straighten up I'm not doing their shows. And when people finally realize that I'm not doing their shows they stop watching. That's what happens. And I must say, I don't say this for a reason, and they're tough. They're very tough on me. But Fox has at least been fair. They've been fair. Fox has been fair. So at some point, at some point we're just gonna keep barreling through. People asked me to run. People asked me to run. At wheel Donald Trump <ph> Letters and everything. You know we have 22.5 million people between Twitter and -- can you believe it? -- you know I have a lot of people, they say, ""Don't use Twitter anymore."" I say ""Why? I get 22 million people between that and Facebook and Instagram. I'm a very modern person in a way, right?"" You know who says don't use Twitter? Your enemies. Why wouldn't I use it? Why wouldn't I -- if I have all these millions of people, and it's a great way to get a message out. So when they write falsely, or say something totally false on the Today Show, or Good Morning America, I've put out a tweet. And you'll see all over television -- we have breaking news. And I may be tweeting from bed. OK? It's true. It's instantaneous. If I put out a beautiful, long, perfectly scripted press release like I did yesterday nobody puts it out. If I put out a 140-character tweet they go crazy. ""We have breaking news."" They break into every story. So you got to use it. <APPLAUSE> Well, here's a story. I love Ohio. I've been here, I work here. I don't know if you know -- I worked in Cincinnati for a period of time. I had great success. It was one of my first jobs. I did it with my father. It was called Swifton Village. And we bought something that was a disaster. It was empty, it had 1,154 units. It was a total disaster. And we bought it from HUD. And turned it around. I was here, I did a great job, it gave me great confidence because it's good to head <ph> with a good job, and then we sold it, at a tremendous profit, and we went on to the next. And I loved Cincinnati. And interestingly, after I sold it, the job went very bad. The job went very bad. I mean -- my timing was very good. I listened to people but I really listened to myself and the timing was beautiful. WE had it for a number of years but we sold it. And the day I sold it, to the day we closed contract, was bought by a REIT. One of the early REITs. It lost a lot of its occupants. That's how the timing was. It was perfect timing. I just think of Cincinnati, the Queen City, I love Cincinnati. I love Kentucky. I go to Kentucky for fun. I won't tell you what -- can you imagine that story if they find out about that? But I love Kentucky. And Kentucky likes me. Boy did I do well in Kentucky. Kentucky. We love Kentucky. And we're gonna take care of the miners in Kentucky. Believe me. We're going to take care of the miners in Kentucky. But I had a great time in Cincinnati and I had a great time in Ohio. The people of Ohio are special people. And they're smart people. And they know what is happening to them, they know great things are gonna happen. We are gonna turn this state into a manufacturing behemoth. We're gonna bring your jobs back. We're gonna bring your companies back. We're gonna bring companies that left, are gonna come back because it will no longer be economic for them to continue where they are. We're gonna bring companies back. We're gonna bring companies back. You know I tell this one story, you've heard about, with Carrier in Indiana. Which I won in a landslide, that was supposed to be the firewall, remember that? Indiana will be his firewall. They said, New York, we've expect him to win Pennsylvania, we expect him to win. Won Maryland, Rhode Island, Delaware -- we won them all. We expect him. But Indiana is going to be the firewall. Right? And then Bobby Knight called, and Bobby Knight -- how about Bobby Knight? We love Bobby Knight, right? Winner. He's a winner. Bobby Knight. And he came out -- 900 games, three national championships, last undefeated college team, won the Olympics, won the Pan Am Games. Other than that, eh, he's a good coach. Right? We love Bobby Knight. And what a job. And what a tough cookie. And he said to me, ""I hope you're gonna run for president."" This is before I knew him. He called me. ""You should run for president. You'll be great."" I said, ""Bobby I haven't decided."" This was before June 16th, a few months. ""I haven't decided."" He said, ""Just run."" And then when I ran I called him and he said, ""I've been waiting for you to call."" And we went to Indiana and it was incredible. But the thing that happened, that I've been talking about for a year, and it happened to be in Indiana, was when Carrier Air Conditioner fired 1,400 people. Right? They fired 1,400 people like dogs. Like dogs they fired them. It's on tape. Had I not seen it on tape, on television, it wouldn't have had the impact that it had. These are people who had worked there, some of them for more than 30 years. And they would follow me around all over Indiana, and I'd have the people from Carrier. So let me just tell you, if I were negotiating and let's say I heard they were gonna close, and if I said, ""Folks. Want to meet with you. Where's your president?"" They send their president along. Said, ""Let me tell you. You're leaving 1,400 great people. Now if you want to stay within the United States that's a different deal. The states will compete against themselves. Right? But you want to move to Mexico? You want to build a plant? I wish you luck. But if you do that you're going to pay this 35 percent tax."" Here's what's gonna happen, folks. Folks. Here's what's gonna happen. So simple. They're not gonna leave. They're not gonna leave. Because it doesn't work economically for them to leave. So now they're not gonna leave. And if they do leave that's OK too because we're gonna make a fortune. OK? We're gonna make a fortune.
<TRUMP:> Now I've been watching this country for seven or eight or nine years, even before Obama, working on plans to stop people and companies from leaving the United States. I've seen low-interest loans, I've seen zero-interest loans -- I've seen it all. I've seen it all. I've seen every plan you can imagine. I've seen where they give them money, they do everything. A lot of these companies don't need money, they just want to make more. But you know what? My plan, which is so simple -- we don't need anything. Nice and simple. And when I say that to the company -- if you're running a company, you in the blue, and you're running a company and I say to you, if you leave Ohio, I wish you a lot of luck, enjoy the warm climate in Mexico. But if you leave Ohio, you're not going to make your product and sell it back into Ohio where you have all these unemployed people. What's going to happen is you're going to have a tax to pay to get the product back in. Now, when you hear that, you're not going to be very fast to leave. You're not going to actually leave, OK. Almost 100 percent, you're not going to leave. It's just not going to work. Because the economics don't work anymore. Now, when my friend talks about, it's the eighth wonder of the world, Mexico <ph>, I think that's great. I respect Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I have thousands of Mexican people that have worked for me over the years. Thousands and thousands, they're great. But their leaders are too smart for our leaders, OK, and they're stripping our country, and they're stripping Ohio. So Hillary Clinton doesn't talk this way. Hillary gets up and she reads her teleprompter, we are going to build new roads. We are going to build new schools. We are going to build -- we are going to build. And just like the two gentlemen that came up here, you'll be let down 100 percent. But me, this is my thing. I've been talking about this for years. You know, somebody said, it's amazing, Trump's been talking about this for 20 years. It used to be Japan. Remember when I talked about Japan? Now it's China, but it's still Japan. Japan made a fortune devaluing their currency. China makes a fortune with currency manipulation. It's cheating. It's cheating. And when I sit down and say, listen, you've got to stop this, you're killing us, you've got $500 billion trade deficits for us, you got to stop it -- we have rebuilt China. And when I tell them this, and when I say, listen, you got to do it, you got to do it -- see, we have all the power, but nobody knows it. Like, when we catch them cheating, ten percent tax right across the board. Every good coming in from China, right. Now, here's what's going to happen -- number one, they're going to stop cheating. And if they don't, we collect ten percent, we make a fortune. But they're going to stop cheating. There's nobody that tells them this. When they come over, President Obama, they put a tent on the White House lawn, right, and they give them a steak dinner like you've never seen before. Although I would have a ballroom. I offered to build a ballroom, you know -- they turned it down. I was going to put up $100 million to build a ballroom at the White House, because having a tent is not that good. It's not even that safe, a canvas tent. And they never even got back to me. That's the way it is. If I were president, somebody offered that, I'd say, give me the top five American architects in the Untied States. Get them over here. All of you, come up with a ballroom that holds 1,000 people, 1,000 people, and they'll come up, and one of them will be beautiful, and we'll build it. I'll take the guy's money. Believe me, I promise, somebody wants to build a ballroom at the White House. They turned me down. No interest. No interest, because that's the way the country is. So, I'm only saying to the people of Ohio, to the people of Columbus, I want to tell you, we're going to turn this country around and we're going to make it so strong and so great, and we're going to run it smart. We're not going to run it stupid like it is. You're not going to have -- when I look at your numbers, when my statistician writes all this stuff out, it's just one bad number after another. It's a terrible -- I mean, honestly, it's a terrible thing. Look, Columbus, Columbus. Ohio has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, right. Columbus has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed an agreement to put China into the World Trade Organization. Hillary rammed through the job killing trade deal with South Korea -- that's been a killer. The deal with South Korea has been a killer. I buy thousands of television sets, thousands and thousands -- nobody makes television sets. Remember, we used to have Sylvania, for those of us that are old enough, we had General Electric, we had all these companies -- we've got nobody. We don't make television sets. We don't make a lot. Soon, we won't make anything. And you can only have so many nursing homes in a factory. A lot of factories were taken, they were made into nursing homes. I think that's great. But you can only have so many of them. We need jobs. Look at this. I mean, abandon <ph> diplomatic personnel -- so many different things. Supports, I told you this -- supports at 550 percent increase, it was sort of amazing, because the press is always saying, well, you're wrong, and you exaggerated that number, no matter -- if you said, two and two are four, they will get these super liberal groups to say, well, he's not really right. It's not really four. You know, when I read off the crime statistics about the police that are being shot, like in Dallas and other places, and I read about it, and I said we had a 50 percent increase in police shootings, and they said, well, yes, but that was only for this year. But if you go over 10 years or 12 years, or if you go over 7.3 years, a little bit less -- look, folks, the country is a mess. We're going to make it strong again, we're going to make it safe again, you're going to be so proud of it. And you're going to be proud of your president, but more importantly, you're going to be proud of your country. So why don't we take a few questions, and when we're finished with the questions, let's go back to work, and those of you that don't have work, hang in there. Jobs will be back sooner than you think. OK, believe me. Yes, go ahead.
<QUESTION: Hi, my name is Dwight Flags (ph) from Aetna (ph) and for years, we've been told by the Obamacare supporters that the law is working because it has increased health care coverage for everybody and also that the health care spending growth has gone down.>
<TRUMP:> Right.
<QUESTION: But that's not true because the CBO (ph) and then CMS has told us the truth. My question for you is, what are you going to do to repeal Obamacare? What's your plan?>
<TRUMP:> OK. There can't be a better question, other than on defense. Because we're going to build up our depleted military, most importantly -- defense is always number one, don't you think? But, we're going to build our depleted -- we're going to take care of our vets. OK. Obamacare. Number one, we're going to repeal it and replace it 100 percent. It is a total disaster. You saw what's happening in Texas. Blue Cross Blue Shield, working through Obamacare, 60 percent increase. Here's the thing -- nobody knows this. The numbers are so bad on Obamacare, so bad, that on November 1, they're going to be announced. Those numbers are presidential election changing numbers. Those numbers are going to be so high, beyond anything we've had, and President Obama is trying to change the date to December 1, because when people see what's going to happen to Obamacare and to your health care numbers, they're so astronomical that people will never vote for crooked Hillary Clinton. They're never going to vote for her.
<TRUMP:> So -- and you asked a very interesting question, the way you phrased it was very interesting. Because you have a lot of part- time workers now that never had a part-time job in their life. You have people in this room -- don't raise your hands, but you have people in this room that are making less money now than they made 18 years ago in real wages. Less money. And, in some cases they're making less money, and working two jobs and that's largely because of Obamacare because companies save money by breaking it up. So, they'll take full-time, beautiful employees that have worked for companies for years and they'll say I'm sorry, you're going to be a part-time employee from now on. Obamacare has been a disaster. Obamacare is so unfair, and, you know, you had a lot of people that had good plans. We have to take care of people that can't, that don't have the money to take care of themselves. You look like a rich guy, OK? At least modestly rich, I think. Could be very rich. But, we have to take care of people that can't afford it. And, I'm all for that. And, we have something coming I think that's going to be great. And, a lot of Republicans would say that's not Republican. Let me tell you, it is Republican, folks. You know, every time I've ever said it I've never had anybody other than the eggheads, you know the people that said Trump is never going to run. And, if he runs, I don't think he'll do very well. We got a six, we got a 12, we got 24, I mean, forget it. But, you know what? Other than these so called, ""eggheads"" we never -- and I mean this, we never had anybody in an audience when I said we're going to have a great plan. We're getting rid of the boundaries, we're going to have great private competition, and you're going to have plans now that we can't even talk about because these companies will come up with plans and it's going to be so much less expensive, and so much better. And, for the people that can't afford that, we're going to take care of them. And, I tell you what, I've never had one person -- and I have the biggest crowds of anybody, I've never had one person stand up and say that's not Republican, except for the eggheads. They say, you can't do that. We got to take care of people. We can't have people dying in the streets. We can't have our vets, as an example, dying waiting in line because they can't get to see a doctor. <APPLAUSE> And, without vets, interestingly, but, without vets when you have these massive waits we're going to have our vets go to the local doctors, or the local hospital, private or public, take care of themselves. They're not going to be committing suicide. Many are committing suicide because of the waits, they can't stand it. They can't stand the pain. Simple procedures can save their lives. Simple procedures. A little incision, a small operation, a pill. A pill can save their lives and they're dying waiting for a doctor, and we're going to -- and my plan is filed. Policy. We're going to have people, they can't get in, they're going to go. They're going to see a local doctor, they're going to see a local hospital, public or private. We're going to pay for the bill. And, by the way, that's number one from the humanitarian standpoint, that's great. And, even less importantly because ultimately we got to save people, it's going to be less expensive. And, we're not going to have the problems that we have where people are committing suicide. So many people every day. Vets are committing suicide because they can't even get to see the doctor to help them. One of the big reasons of vet suicide. So, we got to take care of that, and we're going to take care of the Obama -- we're going to repeal, replace, we're going to take care of everybody, OK? Thank you, good question. <APPLAUSE> OK. Yes, go ahead.
<QUESTION: Mr. Trump, my name's Ryan Rivers (ph), I'm a business owner. President Obama has made thousands of regulations that have hurt small business. As president, what will you do to help small businesses?>
<TRUMP:> Well, it's really a great question, Ryan, because the thing that maybe surprised me the most is -- to me, taxes are very important. It's all taxes. It's such a big cost, or can be a big cost. Now we have a tax bill, or we have a tax law that's very complicated, but it's a big cost. If you would have told me going around -- and I've met so many small business owners, and so many large business owners, that if they had their choice between bringing our taxes down. Now, I have the largest tax decrease <ph> of anybody that's run for office. Larry Kudlow loves it, a lot of people love it, but it's the largest tax decrease of any person running for office from the beginning, Republican or Democrat, OK? Hillary is going to have to double taxes. Is going to have to double your taxes. Hillary Clinton will double your taxes. We're bringing it down to 15 percent. We're simplifying the system. People that are making very little are going to pay nothing until they can break into the system. And, you'll save a lot of money bureaucratically that way. But, people that are making very little are going to pay nothing. Instead of sending in complicated returns, and paying nothing. But, we have a very beautiful plan, very simple, very simple, and very important. But, if you would have told me after speaking with thousands of people that regulations, if they had their choice, you can have either reduced regulation -- because people can't open businesses. They can't run their businesses. You can either have lower taxes or reduced regulation, people would take the regulation. That surprised me. That's how bad regulations are. You're looking at the energy business. The energy businesses is being put out of business. It's being put out of business. Many small business owners have come up to me saying, ""Mr. Trump, I'm going to lose my business because the regulations."" So, we're going to take care. We're going to cut down the regulations. I would be between 85 and 90 percent. OK? Now, some are necessary, I know, for safety, but some are necessary. But, I'll bet we can cut every year. Every year, it must be a cottage industry. They have people that just write regulations all day long. We're going to cut down regulations between 85 and 90 percent. We're going to take care of the environment. We're going to take care of safety, but we're going to let it be that we're going to be a growing, growing. When you look at 1.2 percent, that set a record. That means we're drowning. That means we're going in the opposite direction. So, we're going to take care of regulations, we're going to have very, very, big cuts in regulations. OK, another question? Who's got the mike? Go ahead, yes.
<QUESTION: Good afternoon, Mr. Trump.>
<TRUMP:> Hi.
<QUESTION: My name is (inaudible), I am 16 years old, and I'm from Puerto Rico.>
<TRUMP:> Good. Good place.
<QUESTION: I think you know heroin, heroin...>
<TRUMP:> Heroin.
<QUESTION: It's an epidemic here in Ohio. My question is will you please, will you please cut off the source?>
<TRUMP:> Yeah, I will cut off the source. <APPLAUSE> Build the wall. I will cut off the source. <APPLAUSE> Good question. Very well asked. Thank you very much. Heroin. So, my first victory as a candidate, number one, was New Hampshire, which is a beautiful, beautiful place. Beautiful trees, beautiful meadows, beautiful little roads. And I got to know the people of New Hampshire very well, and I did unbelievable. We won in a landslide in New Hampshire. That was at the beginning when we had all these people competing. It's a great state, and they have unbelievable people, and I got to know the people. And, I'd go into meetings, and I'd say, ""So, what's your biggest problem?"" And they would always say, ""Heroin. Heroin."" I said, ""What do you mean, heroin?""
<TRUMP:> They'd say, ""Heroin."" I'd say, ""This doesn't look like it's a heroin like problem type place."" They say, ""Mr. Trump, it is flowing across our southern border. It's cheaper than candy. Our kids are being poisoned. They're being addicted, not only kids but kids. They're being addicted."" They're dying and for some reason New Hampshire more than any other place talks about it -- that's why I'm so glad you asked that question. But -- heroin. So I said, ""So where do you think it comes -- what's the source?"" It's the southern border. It comes through the southern border. I said, ""Let me tell you. If I win, I'm going to stop it. I'm gonna stop it."" Now we had 16, 500 Border Patrol agents who are unbelievable people. Who if they didn't endorse me would have a much easier job, because all they have to do is stand there and people walk right through them. Right? With me they're gonna stop people from coming into our country. OK? They're gonna stop them. And they're not gonna have to work that hard because of the wall. I asked them, ""How important is the wall?"" They said, ""Very important, very important."" New Hampshire told me about heroin. And I said ""Wow."" And I said, ""If I win, I'm gonna stop heroin from coming into this country and there are going to be big repercussions and I'm gonna get the government of Mexico and other governments to stop it or they've got problems."" With all the money we give them, they'd better take better care. They're not taking care of us. They're not taking care of us. You know I've talked about trade deficits. We have a massive trade deficit with Mexico. That doesn't include the drugs that are coming across. We get the drugs, they get the money. Like this. Big vans coming across. Drugs coming in, money going out. Those days are over, folks. Those days are over. <APPLAUSE> So I won New Hampshire. I then went down to all different places. We did great in Massachusetts, home of Tom Brady. We love Tom Brady. But we did great in Massachusetts, we did great -- sort of everywhere. But I see what a huge problem -- it's not just in New Hampshire. It's all over the place. Heroin is all over the place. Mothers and fathers are losing their children. And heroin is a very addictive thing. It's very hard to get out of that addiction, of heroin. It's very, very hard. And that's the other thing we're gonna do. We're gonna take all of these kids and people, not just kids, that are totally addicted and they can't break it, we're gonna work with them, we're gonna spend the money, we're gonna get that habit broken. But we're not gonna let this crap come into our country and poison our youth and poison our people and it comes in mostly from the southern border. And Hillary Clinton isn't gonna do that. Number one, she's not strong enough to do it. She wouldn't have a clue. So ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. November 8th. You've got to go and vote. I'll be back. I'll be back so much you'll be sick of me. But November 8th, you have to go and vote. We've got to win this election. This is a big one. Ohio is a very important state, we have to go, we have to win this election. I love you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. <APPLAUSE>","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-02"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you. So we have tremendous crowds of people outside. <APPLAUSE> Would anybody like to give up your seat? <CROSSTALK> D. 
<TRUMP:> So I think what we're going to have to do is a little different. You know we have been so crowded, there's something going on big, even bigger than before because every place we go we have these massive crowds. Yesterday, we were in Ohio, we were in Pennsylvania and Harrisburg and we had crowds that were so enormous, so much bigger than the venue. So we're gonna have to start using the basketball arenas, don't you agree? <APPLAUSE> You know, we have -- outside, we have like thousands of people. They're going crazy because they can't get in. So bear with us but I did get to wave to them OK? So it was good. But these are great people. You know. Something very nice just happened to me. A man came up to me and he handed me his purple heart. <APPLAUSE> Now, I said to him now, is that like the real one or is that a copy? <LAUGHTER> And he said that's my real purple heart, I have such confidence in you. And I said man, that's like -- that's like big stuff. I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier. But I tell you, it was such an honor and maybe I can bring him up on the stage Lieutenant Colonel Louis Dorfman, I just have to. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! D. >
<TRUMP:> So I said Lieutenant Colonel would you like to say something? He goes no, sir. I'd like you to just keep saying what you've been saying. It's amazing. <APPLAUSE> What an honor, what an honor. That was great. So thank you all for being here. We're gonna have a little fun this morning and we're going to be back in Virginia a lot. We have to win Virginia. <APPLAUSE> You know, I have a club in Virginia, do you all know my club? Trump National. <APPLAUSE> And if we could do to the United States what I did to that, boy would we have a country. There'd be nothing like it anywhere, ever, in history. But you know, I took over a club what, 10 years ago? And it was on the Potomac River and it's right next door. And in fact, I wish we did this out at the golf club, to be honest with you. Right on the Potomac. Maybe we'll do that, the next one let's do it on the Potomac, I don't know, do it, right? Right? <APPLAUSE> We'll do it outside, on the Potomac, by the American flag. You know, I have tremendous acreage there, we have like almost 800 acres and it's got two clubs, two courses. We have the PGA coming next year for a big, big, big tournament and it's the best there is in the tri-state. It's one of the best golf courses in the country and it's been a tremendous success.D. 
<TRUMP:> Well, I took it over, it was great acreage but it was not so great, right? And we blew it up and built new and it was -- it's been a fantastic success and it's in Loudon County. And therefore I can't imagine that the people of Loudon are going to be voting for crooked Hillary Clinton. She doesn't do anything, because -- I've -- <APPLAUSE> D. 
<TRUMP:> Yeah - <APPLAUSE> D. 
<TRUMP:> So did you see over the weekend Fox, Chris Wallace, where she lied, where she said the FBI Director said like everything was just perfect, it wasn't exactly - I mean she lied, she pure and simple - she only knows to lie. She really does, only knows to lie. But she lied, and it's a big story. It's become a big story and that's amazing. It's amazing that they covered because the press is so totally dishonest, OK? So totally dishonest. And there is nothing like it, I've never seen dishonesty like that. And they're pushing her like crazy because it's establishment stuff and we have to make change. You know she's now calling herself an agent of change. She's been doing this for 30 years. You know numbers just came out for her where she raised like $50 or $60 million and 20 people gave it. I think it was - let's see 20 people gave her $60 million in her fund. $60 million from 20 people. I want to get a list of those 20 people. Oh those 20 people, I want to find out who they are, I want to find out how many I know. I want to find out - I want to find out how many I know. But I'll tell you what, 20 people gave her $60 million. And that's what I've been saying folks. Look I know the game better than anybody and the game is played that way. They own her. They own her. They will do whatever's good for them. If they have a company that wants to move plants into Mexico, she's going to say - first she'll say that's no good. And then she'll say oh I see. They helped me I have to let them do it, because her handlers - that's what they are is handlers -- they write her speeches, they write everything, she doesn't give a talk like this with no teleprompters, she gets up and she has teleprompters, she gets on the stage for 20 minutes, she reads something and she leaves. She goes back home and goes to sleep. That's what she does. She reads it. She goes home. She goes to sleep. And that's OK, I'm not knocking it, but the 20 people, think of it, so you have 20 people giving $60 million, it just got announced or it's being announced today. But we're announcing something even more special. We're announcing that we're going to have more than $35 million from a group of people like almost 60,000 people averaging 61 <inaudible> this doesn't happen to Republicans. You know most Republicans, I mean I think all, if they ever did that they'd have like three people giving $12 and they'll say that's about as good as we're going to do. We're going to have close to 60,000 people, and it's going to be, think of it, it averages $61 approximately. I guess it's going to be filed later or tomorrow or something, but it averages $61 each. And we'll have $35.8 million but I think it's going to even be higher than that, because it's not totally tabulated. But it's going to be higher than that. And that doesn't include other money that we're getting from the RNC and the Republican Party, and it doesn't include the money that I put up, because I put up a lot of money to fund my own campaign. And --<APPLAUSE> D. 
<TRUMP:> - a lot. I think I'm into this for over $60 million - over $60 -- $60 million, if you don't vote for me, look at the money - I'll probably be in for $100 by the time I finish. Think of it $100 million cash -
<UNKNOWN: Talking (ph) 61 ... D. >
<TRUMP:> OK good, thank you. I'll be in for over 100, and think of it, no tax deduction. See, everything I do, I think tax. After tax, before tax, but no deductions. But I'll be in for over $100 million when it's all finished, or thereabouts. And it's a lot of money, that's a lot of money, and nobody else does that. Other rich people don't do that either. Not that many rich people run because they're told if you're rich and if you're successful you can't run for political office because they'll kill you. And I said I agree, I do agree. I think I'm a testament to either never do it or do it. I will say this -- I will say this, it's been unbelievable. It's been -- the journey from June 16, coming down on the escalators, it's been an unbelievable event. I came down with Melania on that escalator and I want to tell you... <APPLAUSE> Everybody loves Melania. <APPLAUSE> They love Melania. She's a good person, I'll tell you that. She's smart and I thought she gave an unbelievable speech, unbelievable presentation. Unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> And Ivanka did the introduction, unbelievable job. <APPLAUSE> And Tiffany and Don and who do we have here today? We have Eric. <APPLAUSE> Eric, where's Eric? Eric come here. <APPLAUSE> Eric Trump, everybody. <APPLAUSE> E. 
<TRUMP:> Wow, this is a great crowd, wow. Well, listen we are, and I say this all the time, but we're so proud of my father. It's an honor to be in Loudoun. In fact, him and I, when I came out of college, the first job we worked on together was the great golf course that we have here. And the two of sat there and we put a tremendous amount of time and effort into rebuilding it and we had a great time and it was kind of the perfect -- perfect first opportunity for a son to work with a father and I've learned so much from this man. He's been such an incredible father and mentor and boss and friend and every other word that you could put on it. He's just the best and he will do a great job for this nation. He will do such a great job for all of you and we are so, so, so immensely proud of him. So, with that, I give you back to the big guy, thank you so much Loudoun County. <APPLAUSE> D. 
<TRUMP:> He's a good guy. He's done a good job. <APPLAUSE> He's in there pitching <ph> and I thought the Republican National Convention was better than the other one, OK? <APPLAUSE> I think my kids were great, I thought everybody did great. I actually thought it was better and we had more people watching the final night because that was the speech, that means a lot, by millions, but I will tell you, I will tell you, yes. Friend or foe? Probably friend. Thank you. All right. Your 15 seconds of fame. Well now that Bernie's out, we don't have the -- doesn't happen anymore, it's like amazing, it's -- you know the safest place to be anywhere, is at a Trump rally, that's true. <APPLAUSE> Safest place to be. I mean I'll just tell you something, you don't even know you're doing it but here we are. We have chairs, right? Everybody's standing.<LAUGHTER> D. 
<TRUMP:> Everybody's standing because we have -- it's excitement. There's like an excitement in the air. You have seats and everybody stands. If you want, you can sit down. But everybody said <ph> -- they don't want to sit down -- but we have such fun considering we have a very bad subject you know the country is in trouble. But were going to make it good you know a lot of people thought my speech was dark. The -- the haters -- no only the haters we got great marks -- but the haters said well he did a good job, his delivery, everything was good but it was dark. And I said, it wasn't dark, I talk about radical Islamic terrorism. <APPLAUSE> I talk about... <APPLAUSE> I talk about drugs pouring across the border, I talk people coming in that aren't supposed to be here, I talk about crime, I talk about our police being shot, we love our police and we have to protect our police. <APPLAUSE> I talk about our veterans because our veterans are being treated horribly. <APPLAUSE> When you hear twenty-two suicides a day that's inconceivable, twenty-two suicides a day. Our veterans are being treated horribly, were going to turn that around so fast your head is going to spin. <APPLAUSE> People.. <APPLAUSE> People waiting in line for 5, 6, 7 days, the veterans, our great people and that's why maybe the lieutenant colonel did that. I mean its such an amazing thing. I -- he showed it me and I said, here thank you very much, here's a -- no, Mr. Trump I want you to keep it. I said, ""keep it?"" I mean these are incredible things that happen, these are incredible people that I meet. And thinking about lieutenant colonel, thinking about our military -- our military is totally depleted, totally depleted. Our military is not being funded properly, we don't have enough money going in. We need a strong military, we need a powerful strong military. <APPLAUSE> When you look at what's happening -- when you look at what's happening around the world and when you look at the hatred, think of it, we are like the whipping post for many, many countries on trade, they kill us on trade. But in every way they don't respect us, China is building this massive, massive military complex in the South China Sea. They didn't get environmental impact statements by the way, they just... <LAUGHTER> They said on Monday morning were going to start building, and on Monday afternoon they started, you knows that's the way it works right? We would -- we could never do that because we would have to environmental impact statements -- would 30 years then they would reject it. <APPLAUSE> We don't do things like that and you know that's fine. They're not supposed it do it -- they're not supposed to do it, they don't respect us. Now very simply, we have tremendous power with China. Some of the top people in the world representing China have called me and one of them in particular, said ""You know Mr.Trump? I thought you were so wrong a year ago. I heard your very strong rhetoric on trade with China and everything with China."" And you have to understand China is great as far as I'm concerned, I want to get along with China -- by the way wouldn't it be great if we got along with Russia? Wouldn't that be great? <APPLAUSE> If we actually had a relationship with Russia, instead of all the fighting and money and the problems and if we could get Russia and others to partner up and go and knock the hell out of ISIS. Wouldn't that be a good thing? Wouldn't that be a good thing? <APPLAUSE> These people... <APPLAUSE> These people are so obsolete. You know these people, you know sometimes they'll say oh could I have a list of your -- the people that you're consulting with. I said, ""Well you're not going to like it because these are people that aren't involved currently.""D. 
<TRUMP:> Well why aren't they involved currently? They said because look at the world, it's a mess. I don't wanna use the people that are involved currently. Look at the world, it's a mess. Look at what happened in the Middle East. Look at what's going on with North Korea. And look at what's going on with -- we have a mess out there. We have a total mess. Because I'll give names that are better and they'll say but these people haven't been involved and I said who wants the people that are currently involved? Nothing's working out. Nothings working out. Look at Libya, look at Syria, look at the migration, look at Iraq, what a mess. Look at -- look at Afghanistan, what a mess. Look at everything. If we didn't do anything with Iraq, if we never went there, if our presidents went to the beach we'd be much better off. If they just went every single day to the beach and took it easy, let Obama go to the golf course. But -- but you know what? We'd be better off. And then the way Obama got us out of the war was a disaster. We're going to get out on a certain date. The enemies sat back and they said nobody could say that, nobody. Actually, they thought it was a form of camouflage. Actually, they didn't believe it until it happened. He actually said when they're getting out. But they laid back and then after we left you -- you see what's happening. So look, we have people that don't know what they're doing. Hillary Clinton will be worse. She'll be worse. OK? Hillary Clinton will be worse. She has bad relationships with people like Putin. I'll give you an example. She has terrible relationships with Putin. This is a nuclear country we're talking about. Russia, strong nuclear country. And so are we. But their stuff is newer. Their stuff is newer. So she's looking at -- they have more -- I don't even want to say it -- they have a lot more, OK? So you know, she wants to play the tough one. She's not tough. She's not tough. I know tough people, she's not tough. I mean she's -- she's just -- she's doing the handlers, they push her from place to place that's all it is. You saw her speech the other night. I mean they talk about presidential, do you think she looks presidential? I don't think so.
<AUDIENCE: No! D. >
<TRUMP:> I don't think so. So -- so you know, she wants to play the role of the tough guy against Putin and Russia and she wants to play not tough, not tough. She should be tough on trade, OK? Because right now we are being ripped off on trade like nobody has ever ripped us off in history. You look at our trade deficits with China. Hundreds, I mean just take a look -- the numbers, five -- think of this. Five hundred and five billion dollars? Look at our trade deficits total, more than $800 billion trade deficits coming out of this area, by the way. Coming out of the state of VA and every place else. I mean I've gone through -- I won so many states. And we won in landslides or I wouldn't be here. Look, if I didn't win, this system was not set up for somebody like me to come in and exert brains and common sense, OK? It wasn't set up for that. It's set up for politicians. <APPLAUSE> And if I didn't win in massive landslides, I mean I won by a landslide. Got 14 million almost 14 million votes. That's more than anybody has ever gotten in the history of the Republican Party. And remember... <APPLAUSE> And that's with 17 people. People keep forgetting, that's with 17 people and yet we had -- you know when Ronald Reagan who we loved. But when other people ran, they'd run against one or two people, or three people.D. 
<TRUMP:> And it's a lot different. Seventeen people, we broke the all-time record. I think we're gonna do so great and I see some great polls. I see one from -- from the Los Angeles Times, just came out, where we're ahead by four or five points. I see one from CNN where we're down. I think these polls I don't know there's something about these polls. There's something phony. You know I watch CNN, they are so negative all day long, it's all Trump all day long, and you know what their ratings are going down, and their ratings are going to start to go down big because I don't do interviews for them. They're doing a big documentary on me now. They have one problem: they need an interview from me, so let them do it without me, who cares. But they're very unfair. All day long it's negative. In fact I have some great things that have happened, right? And they'll cover it in a negative manner, so it sounds negative, great stuff. Great stuff. Even when I was winning -- I was winning by tremendous numbers, we had numerous people left, and I'd get like 42 percent of the vote with many people, getting 42 percent is impossible. I get 42 percent they say why hasn't he hit 50? I said well they're 11 people, how do you get 50. You understand right? No, but CNN treats me so badly it's unbelievable. And you know what I don't watch it anymore, I don't watch. You know you learn to live good, you learn to stay healthy, you learn to have a good common smart mind by turning off the negative does that make sense? Turn it off, don't fight it, turn it off. Just turn it off. But CNN treats me so badly, I mean the New York Times, which I call the failing New York Times because it's failing, it's losing a fortune. And it will be - I think it's out of business in three years, maybe somebody's going to buy it for a little while until they lose all that money, but they'll buy it for a little while and they'll keep it as - you know some rich guys going to buy it. But the New York Times, which is - it could do worse, I mean frankly that wouldn't be bad if somebody bought it -- but the New York Times is failing badly. They write stories that are so bad about me, and you know all my life I've probably been on the cover of the Times a few times, right? Now if I have two stories or three stories a day on the cover - today I have two stories, both ridiculous stories - but today I have two stories -- for <ph> the front page. I mean I guess they use me to sell newspapers, but they are so dishonest. The reporting is so dishonest. I won't get into individual reporters names, because I'd like to - I could tell you the good ones and the bad ones. And they have a couple of good ones over there, but they are such a dishonest newspaper. They want Hillary Clinton to win so badly they cry, they beg, they beg. The editorials are unbelievable. I mean here's a woman who is a total thief, I mean she's a crook, she's a crook, and she lies more than any human being I've ever seen. And she's got no gravitas, and by the way, she's got a bad temperament. She's got a temperament of a loser. I mean I'm going to get the Barack Obama clips when he beat her. Eight years ago Barack Obama said things about her that were so bad, and today I just said, do me a favor look them up because I remember how bad. Now all of a sudden he's supporting her. And you know look it's a hope, because she's going to keep Obamacare, she's going to let people continue to pour into our country and we have no idea who the hell they are. She's going to let the Syrian refugees come in and we don't know if they're ISIS, we have no idea. It's going to be the all time great Trojan Horse -- they come in by the thousands. And she wants - hard to believe, actually it was funny -- I actually said it was 500 percent and the press said I was wrong, they said it was 550. You believe that? They actually even corrected me on that. D. 
<TRUMP:> But 550 percent more coming into the country that are coming in right now. Think of it. So someday, it always happens, look at France, look at Germany, look at what's going on with people blowing themselves up in a bar. With people shooting, look at Paris, look what happened in Paris, 130 dead, many, many people still in the hospital, they'll never be - they'll never be recovered -- never be recovered. But you just take a look at what's happened and you tell me that we have to be weak. Weak and ineffective and that we have to allow tens of thousands of people to pour into our country. She wants 550 percent more people. Think of it, 550 percent more people coming in from that region that are coming in under Barack Obama. And you know they're put all over the country, you don't even know where the hell they are. So we're going to have problems like you have never seen, mark my words, I've been a very good prognosticator. I've called a lot of good things and bad things, but I've called them. But mark my words, you're going to see some bad stuff. We need strong borders. We need strong borders. <APPLAUSE> We can't have people coming in from Syria that have bad intentions and we don't know who they are. And if we do, we are really a very, foolish nation. Look at what's happening with Germany. The crime wave over there -- Merkel's not going to be elected. You know Brexit, I predicted Brexit. Remember? I was the only one. So they were given a 20 percent chance in Las Vegas and the bookies over there, they were saying 20 percent chance. I said I think it's going to win. I took such heat, remember? I took such heat. I won and they gave me -- even though I won they all said bad things. Oh, they said I was grandstanding because I won. I just -- they said who's going to win? I said I think they're going to pull out. They're going to pull out of the union, the U.K. is going to pull out of the union. So I said, the European Union. So I said that's going to happen. And the reason is, I'm there, I have a lot of property in the U.K., great property, fantastic property - Turnberry - I have so many great properties. But you know what? I felt just -- I had a feel, and I'm not there much, I may never it again. If I win, I may never see my property -- I may never see these places <ph> again. But boy is Eric and the kids going to have a good time, right? They're going to have a good time. <APPLAUSE> But, because I'm going to be working for you, I'm not going to have time to go play golf and... <APPLAUSE> Believe me, folks. <APPLAUSE> But I had a feeling. I said I think U.K.'s going for independence because they don't want to have people pouring into their country that they don't know where they are, who they are. They have enough. They have enough. And they've had enough. And they voted and it was a shock. And you know what, they're better off. And you watch, other countries in the European Union are going to follow. Because they were forced to take people and now it's getting to be catastrophic proportions. And you watch what happens to Angela Merkel, who I always thought of as a very good leader, until she did this. I don't know what went wrong with her. I don't know what went wrong. Angela, what happened? What happened Angela? <LAUGHTER> And you take a look at what's going on in Germany, the real facts, OK. I have friends that live in Germany, for years they were so proud. They were saying this is the country, Donald, this is so great, this is the -- people now tell me they're going to leave Germany. Leave. I said what are you talking about? We're going to leave. They take in millions of people and they don't know anything about and what's going on, you know the terms of what's going on. The women have heard all about what's going on, OK? Let me tell you folks, we are allowing thousands and thousands of people into our country. I've spoken to the best law enforcement people that we have, who are great people, and they said there's no way to properly vet these people. There's no way.D. 
<TRUMP:> Because we don't know where they really come from, they have no paperwork so what they do is they make up paperwork. Everybody makes up paperwork. Remember when they stole our passport machine? Remember? They have a passport machine that's better than the stuff we have. OK? These are smart people by the way. This is not -- these are smart people. These are very smart people. And I have a bigger heart than anybody in this room or as big. We wanna do safe zones in Syria, I will get the Gulf States who are not doing much, believe me. The Gulf States have nothing but money. I'm gonna get them to pay. We are $19 trillion; we're not paying for it. We're not pay -- they're gonna pay, they are gonna pay. We are gonna get the Gulf States to pay for it. They're gonna pay. Don't forget, without us the Gulf States won't exist. They won't exist. So we're gonna get the Gulf States to pay <ph>. <APPLAUSE> And we're gonna be the smart country again. But we're not gonna let this happen, where all of a sudden our cafes start blowing up, our movie theaters start blowing up, full of people and all of the other things that you've been seeing all over the world, I mean all over the world. Who would've believed that horrible scene in Nice, who would've believed a think like that's even possible? Just driving a truck down, killing everybody, running all over everybody. You know what they were screaming? They were screaming something that they always seem to scream OK? And I'll tell you what, it's not going to happen here. We're going to be very, very tough, and very, very smart. <APPLAUSE> And we can be, folks -- we can be the stupid people and we can be the politically correct people and guess what? We're not gonna have much of a country left. Believe me, OK? <APPLAUSE> So that we have to have it, so look. Stop <ph> with <ph> it <ph>. You know a lot of bad numbers right? A lot of bad numbers. Hillary said she wants to keep it the same but she's gonna change, you noticed she's saying I wanna keep it the same but we gotta change. First of all, she can't change. She's -- she's been doing it for 30 years. You know II say if she wants to change, why didn't she change? She's been doing this a long time. Her husband signed the worst trade deal in the history of the world, probably, and I really mean that, I'm not exaggerating: NAFTA. The worst -- now, they wanna do TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership. It's going to be as bad as NAFTA if not, worse. Numerous countries, documents that are 5,000 pages long. Our people haven't even read the documents, OK? I wanna do individual country, I like trade. Individual countries boom, boom, boom, if they do a bad job with us -- you have to see what this TPP looks like with the lines. Line, line, lines all over the place, looks like a jigsaw puzzle. Simple, simple deals are tough enough, complicated enough simple. Boom, individual countries. We're rewarding people that have treated us badly and they're going in with people that have treated us well <ph> meaning countries. I want individual countries. And if they do something bad or they devalue their currency so that our companies can compete because you're losing all your jobs, I mean I just left Pennsylvania, I just left Ohio, I just -- I'm going to be very soon in Michigan. Upstate New York is a disaster area, I mean you look at these -- you look at these big, beautiful plants that are just rotting. They're just rotting. I flew into Harrisburg, Pennsylvania yesterday and I looked down and I looked at -- it look like a war zone where you have these massive plants. And you could see 25 years ago vibrance <ph> -- families being taken care of, work, education, healthcare, people working. It's all in Mexico, now. The businesses have moved to Mexico and other places. But between China. Mexico, others, they've taken our businesses. Vietnam, very big right now, really taking over. I mean they're doing a great job for them not for us. Vietnam's a hot one right now, take a look. D. 
<TRUMP:> But we're not gonna let that happen, we're not gonna let it happen. We're gonna be smart. When a company moves and wants to move as an example to Mexico we're gonna wish them luck. But when they wanna sell their product back into this country we're gonna say sorry but you have a 35 percent tax to pay to get your product back in and when we do that they're not gonna move, they're not moving. They're not going to move. <APPLAUSE> Because we will have taken the ""economics of moving"" away from this country. And I've watched for years, I've watched for years, more that just Obama, I've watched for a long period of time, president's saying, and politicians saying how do we keep our companies, because they're moving, they're just leaving. Remember they did the low interest loans, they don't need money. They did all sorts of tax abatements <ph>. They don't want tax abatements <ph>. I'm doing the ultimate, I'm saying you make a product outside of the country and when you leave and when you fire all of our people and you're going to now make that product in -- as an example Mex -- no, there are other places -- but when that product comes across the border you're going to pay a 35 percent tax. And here's what's going to happen. For the most part they're not going to move, OK. I think very few are going to move, because you've taken the whole point out. But they're not going to move. Number one very important, they're not going to move, and if they do move, we're going to make a fortune OK. So it's OK. In fact sometimes you say please move, please move, we'd like you to -- we'd like you send plenty of product in here. When China devalues it's currency, they're making it impossible for our companies to compete. But China doesn't want -- and I'm very close China, I have the biggest bank in the World as a tenant of mine in New York, the biggest in the world a Chinese bank. Don't worry about that baby I love babies. <LAUGHTER> I love babies. I hear that baby crying and I like -- I like it, what a baby. What a beautiful baby, don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around like -- don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful, and healthy and that's what we want. OK, but look -- look China, when they devalue -- when China devalues it's currency they take our guts out. And they do it so often, they do it so often. They're constantly devaluing their currency. And they always wait until like it's a bad time, like we have a problem with Iraq, we have a problem with Afghanistan, every time we have like a big problem they always devalue. And a year and a half ago they devalued the biggest devaluation they've done in 20 years. The biggest in 20 years. And I said man how do they get away -- but we had a problem -- we were doing other things, OK. So when China does that we have fight back. Now here's how you fight back, because we can't fight back any other way. We have the piggy bank, they have ripped us to shreds, ripped us absolutely to shreds, actually I was only kidding you can get the baby out of here. <LAUGHTER> That's all right, don't worry. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking, that's OK. People don't understand, that's OK. But so you have a situation where a great country like China which is a massive -- which has really taken over now if you look. You look at the numbers, you know a year ago they passed us. If you would have said 10 years ago, 15 years ago that China would be passing us I would have said it's absolutely -- anybody would have said it's impossible. We've allowed them to pass us. Now when we have our manufacturers wanting to go to China, they can't get in, number one. Number two if they do get in they have to pay a massive tax. When Chinese companies want to sell to us, no tax, come on in fellas, we're stupid, we're stupid. Then they devalue.D. 
<TRUMP:> I had a friend, he was catching up with China, and he was really starting to compete. He's a very, very close <ph> -- conscious guy, it was hard for him, but he's a really good manufacturer, and then all of a sudden they did a massive devaluation -- boom -- and he's back to ground one. It's like you know you take two steps forward, three steps back. Guess what happened to him? The guys phenomenal he can't get his product into China. When he finally starts to be competitive, they devalued again. And in TPP -- now China is not in TPP -- but it works the same thing with other countries. Their single greatest toom <ph> is devaluation of the currency -- of their currency. We don't even have a clause in the agreement to cover it, okay? And because of the complexity -- 5,000 pages, nobody's going to read it and if you want to get out you can't because there's so many countries involved. So I say ""One, one, one, one, one -- you do 15, you do 20, you do what <ph> everybody and if they don't behave, meaning if they're not good, if they take advantage of us we send them what we call a 30 day notice. <APPLAUSE> Please be advised... <APPLAUSE> Please be advised we are hereby terminating your agreement with the United States of America. <APPLAUSE> Because you cheated, you cheated. <APPLAUSE> You cheated on us and here's what's going to happen, now were are only dealing with one country. We no longer have to worry about you know lets bring this country to the tribunal of all the others countries -- nice and simple folks it's very complicated to start off with nice and simple. So out of the 5,000 pages, I'll bet we don't have one politician in Washington that's read even a page. And these other countries, smart as hell, smart countries by the way -- these are smart countries. They've read every word, every comma, every period, every paragraph, every sentence.
<UNKNOWN: They didn't read Obamacare. D. >
<TRUMP:> They didn't read Obamacare, she's right. Well there's an example, thank you very much I was just about to say that. <APPLAUSE> No but Obamacare is a great example. Obmacare was like 2,500 pages, not one politician read it and now were stuck with it. But don't worry were going to repeal it and replace it. But were stuck with it. <APPLAUSE> It should have died a couple of times, it should have died by our Supreme Court except one of our Republican presidents appointed a man, who kept Obamacare going. Shockingly right? And not one legal scholar can figure It out. It should have died the first time and it should have died the second time and we still have it. And that was a Republican appointee ok and speaking of appointees -- because there's been a few beauties <ph> -- speaking of appointees I am going to appoint great justices of the Supreme Court. Great. <APPLAUSE> And... <APPLAUSE> You know I actually told a group, last night in Pennsylvania, I told a group, I said -- and we had such a crowd, we had -- we had thousands of people -- like outside today. I mean you don't believe it, outside today, seriously we cant use these rooms anymore this is bigger than its ever been. It's a movement we have going -- we have a moment going -- but outside... <APPLAUSE> And I told this group I said ""This big, big"" -- you know thousands of people I said ""Listen even if people don't like me they have to vote for me."" They have no choice -- even if you don't -- and you do like me I hope but, I said ""Even if you cant stand Donald Trump, you think Donald Trump is the worst, you're going to vote for me."" You know why? Justices of the Supreme Court if they pick -- if they pick judges, were going to end up with another Venezuela except just a bigger version, its going to be a disaster for this country.D. 
<TRUMP:> And I've already chosen 11 that were vetted and that are so good -- these are great justices. Federalist Society looked at them, Heritage looked at them, people that were -- are really highly respected and I'm going to pick from that group and we already have one before we start, Judge Scalia. And I want to get as many as I can in the mold of Judge Scalia because... <APPLAUSE> That's where we're looking. That's where we're looking, Justice Scalia, good man. And who knew that was going to happen? That was a surprise, people kept talking about different names but they didn't think him. And all of a sudden he's gone. That was shocking to people. So you never know what's going to happen. And I'll tell you, this could be the presidency with the most Supreme Court picks of any presidency in history. You'll probably have three, you could have four and you could even have five. Look, we have one before we even start, right? Judge Scalia. But you could even have five and can you imagine if Hillary Clinton picks five super-libs because what she is, is she's being pushed around by the Bernie Sanders crowd. Many of whom, are going to vote for us because of our trade policies, OK because they understand that trade is killing our country. <APPLAUSE> All right? <APPLAUSE> So, I want to go over a couple of facts before I do though, I want to just say this. Look, we have a movement going. This is beyond anything that anybody's ever seen. Commentators are saying on television, people that hate me, are saying on television that they have never seen anything like this, they call it the phenomenon. It's a phenomenon. They have never -- our crowds are much bigger than Bernie's were. And Bernie did good, Bernie was second, I will say that. Far greater. Hillary, last night in Harrisburg, where I had, I don't know 12,000 people, we had to send away thousands. Hillary had 800 people, OK? Now I don't know what it means, I mean maybe it doesn't mean anything. I think it should mean something, I think it should mean something. <APPLAUSE> I mean when you have crowds that are many, many times the size of your opponent, I would think that it would mean something. But we have these massive crowds. I mean I felt so badly about when I went through and I'm waving to everybody but they're all standing out there and I feel guilty about it. But here's the story, we have a movement going, it's an incredible movement. It's a movement like they say they've never seen in this country before. And I say it a lot because I have a lot of respect for him, Bill O'Reilly. He said it's the single greatest phenomenon. He called it the Trump phenomenon. It's the single greatest phenomenon, politically speaking, that he has ever seen in his lifetime. I mean that's -- you know, guy's seen a lot of stuff, right? <APPLAUSE> And Bret Baier said it. Bret Baier, good guy, said it. And Brit Hume who said it. He doesn't like me too much but he said that, or something similar. And people have said this, that what we are doing is one of the great political phenomena of all time but very importantly, it's one of the great movements of all time. We've got to finish it off. We've got to finish it off. <APPLAUSE> We've got to beat... <APPLAUSE> We've got to beat a dishonest machine, totally dishonest machine. You know as an example how Hillary got away with what she got away with recently. How do you get away with it? Everybody thought, oh wow she's guilty. However, now what she got away with was a disgrace, honestly. A disgrace to our country, but she got away with it. And who would think that that could have happened? And then on top of it she lies on Sunday saying, oh I was just actually fine. I did everything fine. And that was not said. You know it was said, very embarrassingly. Nobody could believe that happened. That whole thing was incredible, but we have to learn from it.D. 
<TRUMP:> It's a crooked system. It's a rigged system. We're running against a rigged system and we're running against a very dishonest media. The media's very dishonest. It's very, very dishonest. <APPLAUSE> What they don't take -- Patty Smith -- when they don't take Pat, whose an unbelievable woman and they give her virtually no air time, and they give other people unbelievable amounts of air. It's just so unfair, it's so unfair, we're running against a rigged press. We're running against dishonest people. <APPLAUSE> OK, really dishonest people. <APPLAUSE> And -- and hey look it was rigged against Bernie Sanders, you could see that from all of those emails. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, no no, but you could see it, it was a rigged deal. He never had a chance, the guy works so hard, and now he's got buyers remorse. You know you look at him, if he would have done nothing, if he would have just gone home and gone to sleep he would have been so -- because he made a deal with the devil, he made a deal with the devil. And he made a bad deal, and then she picks a Vice President that's the exact opposite of everything that Bernie represents. Now I don't agree with what Bernie represents, but I mean, honestly, it was almost 50 percent of their party. You would have thought she would have given him a little bit of a bone. She gave him nothing, she gave him nothing. So we have to get everybody out, Loudon County is so important. And really I'm a big employer here, I'm a big, big employer here. <APPLAUSE> And -- and everybody in this room -- everybody in this room knows how great that project is and how successful it's been because many of you -- whose been there, how many people have been there? It's one of the great projects in the country, all along the Potomac River, one of the great -- thank you -- one of the great projects in the country. So let's go over a couple of numbers because you have to see this to really believe it. And by the way, Hillary Clinton has not had a news conference I think it's in 242 days. She doesn't do news conferences because she can't. Because for a number of reasons, but number one she's so dishonest, she doesn't want the people peppering her with questions, so she doesn't do news conferences, it's a disgrace. I think it's 242 days, you know what that is -- and she probably won't have one, maybe she won't have one. Maybe we'll force her to have one, but she probably won't have one. So listen, since 2000 the number of unemployed people in Virginia has doubled. Now these are right out of the book so, statisticians OK. Virginia has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA. Signed by Bill Clinton, one of the worst ever, OK. Hillary rammed through the job killing trade deal with South Korea in 2011. That South Korean deal is a disaster for us. But look at the people that give her money, and look how their involved in that deal. The US trade deficit with TPP members --- these are the members going into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Obama wants, which Hillary wanted, she called it the gold standard, but when she heard me talking about it she said she didn't want it. But as you're governor said, Terry McAuliffe, Governor of Virginia, he said don't worry, don't worry, let her get elected and she'll approve it. She'll make a couple of minor changes, she'll approve it.D. 
<TRUMP:> This was said, then they backpedaled, well he doesn't speak -- let me tell you Terry McAuliffe knows her better than Bill knows her. Terry knows her better than anybody, your Governor, he made this statement. OK, all right, so here's a couple of things that are just sort of amazing. President Obama has doubled the national debt since he's been in office. U.S. trade deficit in goods reached nearly $800 billion. In other words, we trade with people. You know, it's funny when I want to make good trade deals the press says oh, he's not a free trader. I'm a great free trader. I like free trade. But I like smart deals. Somebody said well, then what do you call yourself? Because I know free trade, I know fair trade, I know every form of trade ever thought up by man. Believe me, it's meaningless. So they said what are your policies? I said my policies are very simple, I wanna make great deals for our country OK? Very simple. <APPLAUSE> You can call it fair trade, free trade or any other of the other 10 ten names. I want great deals for our country. And I was endorsed by Carl Icahn some of the greatest business leaders in the world. And we have to use our great business people to negotiate the deals. Because we're using political hacks to make deals and it's a joke. The Chinese people look at us like we are the dumbest people. They are using their smartest, their brightest from the time they're three years old, you know they have like a pyramid, right? Boom, boom, boom, they use the guys right on the top. And they walk in and deal with our clowns and they say I can't believe we've gotten away with this. For years and years and years, we've rebuilt China with our trade. We've rebuilt China. We have so much power over China and if they don't behave we throw a 10 percent tax on goods coming in from China. We will make a fortune. And you know what? They're gonna send the same goods. Then what are they going to say, we're not gonna send because we're not gonna pay a 10 percent tax? But when they raise their currency -- when they do things with their currency, they manipulate. And they knock out their currency. And they devalue their currency and they do all their masters, they're grand masters at currency and a currency manipulation. We have the ultimate -- we say thank you very much. Now, just so you understand, when we send things to China they charge us a tax. So people would say Donald Trump is not a free trader. I'm a free trader. But it's gotta be a two-way street, right? I mean it's gotta be a two-way street. They're killing us. <APPLAUSE> $23.8 million Americans in their prime earning years are out of the labor force right now. In the last seven years, another 14 million people have left the workforce OK? Nearly 4 in 10 African American children are living in poverty while 58 percent of African American youth are not employed, OK? Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took office. Now, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. We're gonna bring jobs back. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, that's very nice. We're gonna bring jobs back. That's why we had a very good poll recently with the Hispanics. And it was an amazing poll. And you know -- way up from what people thought. Because people want jobs. And by the way, the Latinas, the Hispanics, they don't want -- and you understand this, they don't want people pouring into our country taking their jobs, taking their houses. They want -- they wanna have security, they really want the wall. They want the wall. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna have a strong border and we're going have the wall. We're going have the wall. <APPLAUSE> Oh we're going build a wall, don't even think about it. We're going build a wall and you know -- you know and I say it and I mean it, Mexico's paying for the wall folks. <APPLAUSE> You know, if Mexico wanted to, they could stop all of the problems that are coming into our country, including the drugs. New Hampshire -- which I won -- I got to know the people so well up there. What's your number one problem? Heroin coming from the southern border. And I said doesn't make sense, you go to South Carolina, North Carolina. No matter where. Here, you go no matter where, we have drugs pouring into our country. We could stop it. You see, our politicians don't wanna stop it because there are people out there that make a lot of money with that and they take care of the politicians. They don't wanna stop it. They could stop it. But Mexico could stop it, without even us, 16,500 border patrol agents endorsed me recently, OK? <APPLAUSE> Sheriff Joe, endorsed me. Sheriff Joe Arpaio. <APPLAUSE> From Arizona, which is great. We're gonna get it going. But we're gonna build a wall, Mexico's gonna pay for the wall and some politician came up to me. Number one, you can't build a wall. I said really, China just build a 13 -- 2,000 years ago -- built a 13,000 --- China built a 13,000 mile long 2,000 years ago. We have 1,000 miles that we need. It's 2,000 miles but we need 1,000 you have natural barriers. We need 1,000 miles. So China can do 13,000 mils 2,000 years ago -- and that's the serious wall by the way in case anybody hasn't seen it. And we can't do -- we can't do a wall that's 1,000 miles and we have Caterpillar tractors. And we're gonna use Caterpillar, by the way. We're not going with Komatsu. We're not going with Komatsu. <APPLAUSE> So here is one of the most depressing stats. According to the second quarter GDP report, you saw this yesterday, the economy only grew at 1.2 percent. This is the third straight quarter that the economy has grown under two percent and is the single weakest -- weakest of any economic expansion in more than 70 years. So we have the weakest expansion in 70 years and it's going back -- now it's going down because the numbers are getting worse and worse all the time. If they get real bad I hope it happens fast so I don't have to -- they'll all blame me. You'll end up winning and your first day the economy crashes because of some incompetent people before me well, we're gonna straighten up. But we'll certainly blame them. OK, we're going to blame them. <APPLAUSE> No but think of it, the weakest in 70 years, 70 years. I mean it's terrible. Now, here's another one. U.S. home ownership, the rate fell, of ownership, to 62.9 percent in the second quarter. The lowest rate of home ownership in more than 50 years, terrible. Did Hillary mention any of these facts in her optimistic speech?
<AUDIENCE: No! D. >
<TRUMP:> OK and we're not talking about the shooting of the police which by the way is at massive levels, massive levels. We're not talking about crime. In major cities, our crime is going through the roof. You look at what's going on in some of these cities, crime is up numbers that you wouldn't even believe. They don't talk about that, they talk about how everything's wonderful. Look, with Hillary you're gonna have four more years of Obama and you know what? If you have four more years of Obama our countries finished. It's finished. <APPLAUSE> Here's one that's an amazing -- here's one that's amazing. Household incomes are more than $4,000 lower than their levels in the year 2000. Think of it, household -- you're making $4,000 less now than you did 16, 17 years ago.D. 
<TRUMP:> Another one that's very common and out there, people -- many people in this room -- but people are making, in terms of real wages, less money today than they made 18 years ago. And they're working two jobs in many cases and that's because of Obamacare. Because Obamacare, it makes sense for employees to do part time workers. So you'll have a worker who's worked at a company for years and all of a sudden the boss goes up to him to say I hate to do it, with tears, and says I've got to make you a part time employee. Because of Obamacare. Its forced people to be part time employees. It's a horrible thing that's going on in this country. And you didn't hear that in Hillary Clinton's speech. You didn't hear that, you didn't hear that. You heard all is slowing stuff. It's a disaster. And then when you look at other countries, how they've built up their military -- look at Russia. How they've built up their military. Take a look at what they've done. Take a look at what they've done on the nuclear weapons front. How they built up their military and how we're so far behind and our equipment is obsolete in many cases, and we have jet fighters that are so old that they have to go to graveyards, airplane graveyards and museums to get parts for current jet fighters. And we have our pilots, our wonderful, incredible pilots saying it didn't use to be this way. And now they're older and they're going to leave and they're going to retire and they don't want to stay. They're so depressed at what's happened. But they're fighting, you saw the report, you probably all saw it. They had documentaries on television about how old our aircraft is in our services. And you have other countries, you look at China, what they're doing with their massive, with their massive installations that they're building in oceans. South China Sea, massive, we would never even think about it. No, we've got to get smart folks, we've got to get smart. We're falling way behind. <APPLAUSE> We're falling. And I can keep reading this stuff, it's just point after point, you're doing lousy over here by the way, hate to tell you, but point here's recent factory closings in Virginia, all right? Right? Kennametal, Ball Corporation, closed. Kennametal closed. Sandvik closed. Moved their jobs to Mexico. Let's see, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, yes. Smith Foods Inc. closed its plant, 400 workers gone. Anybody used to work for Smithfield?
<AUDIENCE MEMBER: (OFF-MIKE) D. >
<TRUMP:> That's true. I -- it's true. Stanley Furniture closed its plant in Vista. Laid off 400 workers, closed its plant. Moved their jobs to China and Canada. North Carolina has lost so many jobs. Pennsylvania has lost tremendous numbers of jobs. Ohio has lost 34 percent of their manufacturing jobs since China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. Folks, what are we doing? What are we doing? Are we -- we're being led by stupid people, folks. <APPLAUSE> And people that are controlled. <APPLAUSE> People that are controlled by special interests and lobbyists so here's the story. So we've got to build up our military, we've got to make great trade deals. I told you that no more, when our companies leave, they want to -- they think they're going to leave and sell us back-product from a different company with other employees from other nations, not going to happen. Not going to happen. I mean it's going to happen, but they're going to pay for it. There's going to be consequence. They're going to pay a tax, very simple. Now a lot of people think I'm not conservative because I want them to pay a tax. I think they're not conservative because they're stupid.<LAUGHTER> D. 
<TRUMP:> OK, they're stupid. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, it's 100 percent foolproof. We're not talking about oh, maybe it will work. Can you imagine they used to go around and offer companies loans? And its not even funny. We'll give you an interest free loan if you stay. And a couple of companies took the money and then left because they forgot to say you had to stay. The lawyers didn't do too good a job. But look, look, we have to be the smart people again. We have to be -- and we don't have much of a choice because we are losing so many of our jobs and we can't take our factories and keep taking our factories and converting them into nursing homes. You know nursing homes are wonderful, but we have to make things again. We need jobs, we need jobs. It's wonderful. Nursing homes is wonderful. But we need jobs. <APPLAUSE> I see things happen where there's a couple of beautiful jobs up in New England, they've taken an old factory, they've converted it into -- and it's all fine. But we can't do that. We need manufacturing jobs. We need the income, we need the productivity, we need the future. We -- as you stand here right now, there are companies negotiating from Virginia, right here. They're negotiating to leave Virginia and move to Mexico and other places, as you stand here. Some of the people in this room work for companies that are right now under negotiation to get out. If I get in, that ends. Hillary won't do anything about it, she talks, she knows her way now, she's talking about trade. Did you notice two days ago she said, I've been talking about, we're going to re-negotiate NAFTA. And if they don't give us a great deal and if we don't re- negotiate a great deal, we're terminating NAFTA, we're getting out and we'll bring our jobs back a different way, OK? So... <APPLAUSE> The other day, now that was like, a horrible thing to say. Two days ago, Hillary Clinton said, we are going to start re-negotiating our trade deals. She can't do it. Number one, if she wanted to she can, but they wouldn't let her. Those people that put up all that money for her, those 20 people and there's plenty of more of them, they won't let her do it. She can't do it, if she wanted to, she can't do it. So she's just kidding all of you. So we're going to make America great again. <APPLAUSE> We're going to build up our military, so depleted. We're going to take care of our veterans, who have been treated horribly. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make phenomenal trade deals, we're going to make trade deals that bring jobs back, not trade deals where we lose our businesses and our jobs. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have strong borders, we're going to have the wall, Mexico's going to pay for the wall, and we're going to have people come into our country but they're going to come into our country legally, legally. <APPLAUSE> We're going to appoint great Justices of the United States Supreme Court. <APPLAUSE> We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> We are going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to start winning again, folks. We're going to win on every front. I want to thank everybody in Loudoun County, I love this place, I'm here a lot. I want to thank everybody. I want to thank everybody in the state of Virginia. Virginia, we are going to be here so much you're going to be so sick of me, you're going to say, please keep him out of here, we'll vote for you, but please keep him out. I'm going to be in Virginia a lot, we're going to be here a lot. <APPLAUSE> And just so you know, we are going to be proud of our country again. We're going to put America first. We are going to start winning again. We are going to make America great again. Thank you very much, thank you folks. Thank you very much. Take care everybody. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-04"">
<LEPAGE: Hello. Hello, great Maine. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you all for coming out. Thank you all for coming out and supporting the next president of the United States, Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) You know the last few days, the media has been asking me, are you still supporting Donald Trump? The answer is very simple, yes, more than ever. (APPLAUSE) You know, Donald Trump and I are a little bit alike. (CHEERING) I'm trying to get him out of his shyness. The media has been very tough, not only on Donald Trump these last few days, actually from the beginning. They attack him every single day. And believe me, over the last six years, I know what it's like. (APPLAUSE) They love to sensationalize a few comments, and then they make a big issue out of it. And sometimes it's deceptive but most of the time is not true. (APPLAUSE) They're ignoring the threat of terrorism in this nation. They ignore the $20 trillion that's racked up by the President and Congress, and they're not talking about it. (APPLAUSE) Donald Trump is... (CHEERING) ...he's not ignoring the facts of where our country is going if somebody doesn't start leading. (APPLAUSE) I will tell you I support him for three basic reasons, and beyond that there's probably a dozen more. But the most important, he's not afraid to say it the way it is. (APPLAUSE) He is not afraid to say who is a world threat and their name. He's not afraid to call them by their name. (APPLAUSE) They are radical Islamic terrorists. (APPLAUSE) We know -- we know that the current plan to keep America safe by the Obama administration and Clinton will not work. It hasn't worked and we need to change direction. (APPLAUSE) Second, he's a businessman. And I'm not a politician either, I'm a businessman, and he's the same reason we have to elect them is because we need to take a hard, hard look at the $20 trillion that is put over the heads of our children, our grandchildren, and yes, future unborn great grandchildren are going to be paying off this debt. (APPLAUSE) So he's not a politician, he's a businessman and he's the man of the times we have to put him in Washington. (APPLAUSE) And thirdly, it's very simple. I've met many of his kids. And the one thing you know, they are pleasant, very respectful, and very intelligent. To achieve that, you have to be a great dad to bring out great children. (APPLAUSE) And our media, you know, I was talking yesterday with George Hale about the media, the media that he joined a few years ago. And guess what? He admits that the objectivity and the fact- checking of media today is long gone. You know, they ignore the real problems in the country and the real problems in the country are at the beltway in Washington, D.C. -- the elected officials. (APPLAUSE) They are very quick at taking a seven-second sound bite, ignore the context in which it's meant and they ignore all the problems that they don't want to bring out. And actually, Donald Trump, while he's being criticized every day, his opponent is getting a free pass. We need -- we need to reject -- we need to reject corrupt politicians. (APPLAUSE) We need to reject self-enrichment. We need to make sure that we, the people of this country, defeat the queen of corruption. (APPLAUSE) We do not need -- we do not need another Barack Obama third term. We need a president that will say it the way it is, a president that will fight to protect our children, and their future, and their ability to enjoy and strive for the American dream. (APPLAUSE) We need a president that will protect us at home and our allies in foreign countries as well. (APPLAUSE) We must elect Donald Trump the next president. (APPLAUSE) He will make America great again. So ladies and gentlemen, it is my distinct honor to introduce to you the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. (MUSIC) (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> I want to tell you, you happen to have a truly great governor. <APPLAUSE> And he said something that really caught my imagination. He used the term ""the queen of corruption."" I think we're going to have to... <APPLAUSE> ...we're going to have to use that a little bit. She is the queen of corruption. <APPLAUSE> So, as you -- thank you, thank you. Thank you, man <ph> thank you. Thank you very much. It's very nice. It's a very, very rambunctious and beautiful crowd, I will say. <APPLAUSE> Wow. That's a lot of people. <APPLAUSE> That's a lot of people, so thank you all very much. This has just been amazing. This has been an amazing, an amazing period of time. No matter what we do, no matter where we go, it's incredible. We were in Florida yesterday, two tremendous -- and just big, big arena sold out, packed, thousands of people outside couldn't get in. That's the bad news. But this is really nice. And I have to tell you I woke up yesterday, and I saw $400 million, different currencies -- they probably don't want our currency. Different currencies, $400 million being flown to Iran. I mean, folks, what's going on here? What's going on? What is going on? You see it. You don't believe it. $400 million in cash is being flown in an airplane to Iran. I wonder where that money really goes by the way, right? I wonder where it really goes. Well, it went to, one, either in their pockets, which I actually think more so or toward terrorism, probably a combination of both. So $400 million in cash, now you really -- who -- who can authorize even in terms of a president, who can authorize $400,000 in cash, different currencies. They didn't want the dollar. They wanted different countries, different currencies. They got a little of everything over there. Just <ph> spread it around, right? I mean, how stupid are we -- how stupid are we to allow this to continue to go on, to see what's happening? And you know it's interesting because a tape was made, right? You saw that with the airplane coming in, nice plane. And the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess, right? That was given to us -- has to be by the Iranians. And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country, they want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent. They want to -- they want to embarrass... <APPLAUSE> ...they want to embarrass our president. I mean, who would ever think that they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape. It's only for one reason, and it's very, very sad. So, we have a lot of problems in our country. We have border problems. People are pouring into our country. We have no idea who they are. We have people -- we're going to build a wall, folks. Don't worry about it. We're building, yeah <ph>. <APPLAUSE> Up here, you have tremendous heroin problems. You have tremendous problems, comes from the southern border, but you have tremendous problems. And I'll tell you what, we're going to get -- so we're going to build a wall. You know, we have another thing. We have 16,500 -- you can do whatever you want. Do whatever you want. Do whatever you want. Well, you have to say, you know, a Trump rally is the safest place in our country to be, believe me -- believe me, right? <APPLAUSE> We do say. But if we keep going the way it is, our whole country is becoming different. They're shooting our police at record levels. You saw where I said in my speech 50 percent higher, and then they went out, and they looked... Ain't that amazing? Ain't that amazing? Sorta rude <ph>. You know, when you think of it -- and what are we looking for? We want strong military. We want jobs. We want good education, health care, right? <APPLAUSE> We're all like looking for the first. We're looking for the same thing sort of you want to have a good life. You want to have a good life. You want safety, and then we have people interrupting constantly. But actually, it hasn't been happening much. It's happening a little bit today, but it hasn't been happening much. I sort of missed my protesters, you know. <LAUGHTER> And we don't get it from Hillary because there's no -- you know, the Bernie people had spirit. We don't get it from Hillary because they don't care. They don't care. But you look at what's happening in terms of our police where they're shooting our police at record levels -- 50 percent up. And I said 50 percent, it's actually much higher than that from last year. So, we need law and order. We have to have it. We have to have it. <APPLAUSE> We need law and order. We got to protect our police. <APPLAUSE> And our police have to be careful, and they have to do their job and they have to do it correctly, and they will do it correctly, but we have to take care of our police. I'll tell you. They're really going through a tough time. <APPLAUSE> So, I wrote a little thing down that I thought I'd have because in light of the $400 million that just got ripped away from our country, all right? And, you know, the real number -- you look at it, $150 billion, we got nothing. We got nothing. And they think they probably paid the $400 million for the hostages, which is even worse. And now since then, I don't know if you know, we have two more hostages right now. Why wouldn't they? We have two more hostages right now who were fairly recently grabbed, and they're in Iran. And I guess, what are we going to do with that one, right? So they do $400 million, gets flown at night into Iran. I think it's so sad and so disgusting. And you also wonder about a government, who can approve a thing like that? Will they take cash into a country and just hand it to them? Bushels and bushels of cash. And then you look at our country where we owe $20 trillion as I used to say 18, used to say 17. When I started, I was saying 16 and 17. Now it's 18 and 19. Now it's going to very soon be 20. It's going to be 22 very soon because we have a budget that is very, very expensive, but it doesn't take good care of our military. Our military is depleted, and we have to fix our military and I know for the -- for the Navy. <APPLAUSE> One of the reporters was talking about -- one of the reporters -- how do you feel about building ships because you have a lot of ships you're building up here, good ones, right? <APPLAUSE> So our Navy, as you know, has one of the lowest numbers of ships that they've had in decades and decades. And we've got to rebuild our Navy. We've got to rebuild our whole military, folks, and we're going to do it... <APPLAUSE> ...probably almost never have needed it more than we need it now with all of the people out there that don't like us very much. And we're going to be very strong, we're going to be very smart. We're going to build up our military. It's so depleted. We're going to take care of our Vets. We're going to take care of our Vets. <APPLAUSE> Our Vets -- our Vets are so badly treated. You look at what's going on where they wait on the line six, seven, eight days. Think of it. You're not a Vet, think of it. In the audience, think of it, six, seven, eight days. People are dying on the line waiting for doctors and committing suicide. The suicides are at numbers that nobody has ever thought possible. We're going to take care of our Vets. I put a plan, and people are loving the plan. <APPLAUSE> People are loving the plan. And if you're waiting, if you're waiting on the line for an extended period of time, you're going to walk outside, you're going to go to a doctor who's looking for business. You're going to go to a hospital, private or public, you're going to get taken care of and it's going to be less expensive. The government is going to pay the bill. It's going to be far less expensive than what's been happening. People are dying, waiting on the line for a simple pill or a simple prescription. They are dying. Our great Veterans are dying waiting on the line, and we're not going to do it. We're not going to do it. <APPLAUSE> No more, no more. So, I wrote a few things down and I -- to ISIS, OK, huge portions. We don't know. Is ISIS coming into our country? With all of the people that are pouring in, we have no idea who they are. We have absolutely no -- you know the harm they want to inflict. You look at what's taking place in our country -- San Bernardino and Orlando. And look at what -- what's going on all over the world. I mean, look at the World Trade Center. Look at what's happening. Look at what's happening. Oh, boy. The wildlife, so you look at what we've sacrificed and what we've given up, and the level of viciousness where heads are being chopped off, where people are being drowned in steel cages. We haven't seen this since medieval times. I mean, you know, I love history. We talk about medieval times and you would never have thought you would have seen the things we're seeing today, and it's gotten out of control. And Obama has let it get out of control. And then you have Hillary's made tremendous mistakes in every way. I guarantee you this, if Obama had it to do again, he would have never picture -- never as Secretary of State because he has gotten... <APPLAUSE> ...into such trouble with the decision that she probably made or convinced him to make that it's ridiculous. So, the Obama-Clinton foreign policy has handed huge portions of Iraq, Libya, and Syria to ISIS. I mean, huge portions, undermining the stability and strength in Egypt and empowered Iran as never before. Iran is like this major power. And when they made this horrible deal, why didn't they solve other problems with Iran? You know, Iran is fighting us in other places, right? They're fighting us in other places. Why we didn't we say, wait a minute, we're giving you back all of this money. We're giving you all. It is a horrible deal in every way. We got nothing in that deal. We got our hostages back and now we find out what we actually paid for the hostages and it was in cash, which is terrible, because that sets a terrible, terrible precedent. And it's just sickening and you'll have four more years of Obama if you elect Hillary Clinton... <BOOING> ...four more years. The most important issues facing civilization right now is radical Islamic terrorism, and we have a president... <APPLAUSE> ...we have a president that won't use the term, won't say it. He won't say it. Maybe he doesn't believe it. He right now thinks that global warming is the greatest threat that this world has. So we've just seen many, many crimes getting worse all the time and as Maine knows, a major destination for Somali refugees, right? Am I right? Well, they're all talking about it -- Maine, Somali refugees. We admit hundreds of thousands, you admit, into Maine and to other places in the United States, hundreds of thousands of refugees. And they're coming from among the most dangerous territories and countries anywhere in the world, right, a practice which has to be -- has to stop, has to stop. This isn't like you're smarter than other people or... <APPLAUSE> ...this is a practice that has to stop. Not like we say, oh, let's do something. We want to be nice, and we want to -- as in the case of Syria, we'll build safe havens. We'll do something. We'll get other nations that are near the Gulf States as an example. They don't spend money. <APPLAUSE> They don't spend money. They don't take people. We take people. They don't take people and they're right there to spend money. Believe me, folks, they're going to spend money. They wouldn't be there if it weren't for us. So the Washington Times reported of a Somali refugee program in Minnesota that the effort to resettle large groups of Somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the states -- I mean, the state is having tremendous problems -- its safety net and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting charges for Islamist terror groups. It's happening -- it's happening. You see it happening. You read about it. You see it and you could be smart, and you can be cunning and tough or you can be very, very dumb and not want to see what's going on, folks. All you have to do is take a look at what's happening in Germany, OK? It's a mess. It's a mess. <APPLAUSE> Take a look -- take a look at what's happening in France. Take a look at what's happening in France. Two weeks ago, Nice -- you remember in Paris. In Paris we had the disaster, 130 people viciously violently killed. And by the way, if you had some guns on the other side of that equation, it wouldn't happen. Believe me, you wouldn't have had the tragedy that you have. <APPLAUSE> Remember this, Hillary Clinton essentially wants to take away your rights under the Second Amendment. She wants to take away your guns. She wants to take away those bullets. She wants to take away your rights. Now the National Rifle Association not only endorsed me, they endorsed me, I think, earlier than anybody they have ever endorsed. <APPLAUSE> We need to protect our Second Amendment. We have to do it, we have to do it. Believe me -- believe me, you're going to have things happening with you -- if she gets in, remember, justices of the Supreme Court -- very important -- so it goes along with that Second Amendment because they'll be ruling very negatively... <APPLAUSE> ...if you put her there. Very important, I said to a friend of mine, I said, ""Well, you have to vote."" He's a Democrat, so you have to vote for me. Why? Number one, I'm your friend. <LAUGHTER> He said, ""You'll be the first Republican I'll ever voted for that's, OK."" But I said justices of the Supreme Court, she will put because she was forced so far left. She will put super, super Liberal judges into what could be four or five slots. I mean, you have one before you've even started -- Judge Scalia who's terrific, but you have a situation where she could have or the next president could have as many as five. More likely it will be three or four, but it's going to be perhaps a record number of justices of the Supreme Court. And if no other reason you have to go out and you have to vote for Trump, right? <APPLAUSE> So just few other instances, the Boston bombers, remember the Boston bombers? What a horrible thing that was. Arrived through the political asylum process, right? The younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on September 11, 2012. The older brother had a pending application for citizenship. Oh, that's wonderful. We take them, right? We take them. And you see what happened. How violent and how vicious and how horrible was that? OK. And if they're not here, we don't have that incident, which killed so many and so badly wounded so many. And what I said -- and what I said is so true. So many of these -- you look at San Bernardino, what I said is so true, Second Amendment. If guns, a couple, one where on one of the people, two of the people, three of the people in San Bernardino so the bullets are flying in the opposite direction. Number one, they probably would not have made the attack. <APPLAUSE> And number two, if they were -- right? And number two, the carnage -- and it was carnage, 14 people killed, many, many people in the hospital even to this day it wouldn't have happened or it certainly would have been a lot less. And we have to get smart. This is the way the world works, and we have to get smart. And, you know, in Paris where they walked in -- and the same with San Bernardino, they walked in. No guns they knew, and they go boom, boom, get over, boom, boom, boom. 130, the other case 14, and we have many other cases. And this is all over the world now, this is now all over the world. And we are letting people come in from terrorist nations that shouldn't be allowed because you can't vet them. There's no way of vetting them. You have no idea <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> This could be the great Trojan Horse of all time. <APPLAUSE> A Moroccan national who came to the United States on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university and a federal courthouse. Ubek <ph>, you know where that is. You know where it is? Uzbek refugee living in Idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror, and this is what they do -- teaching terror recruits how to build bombs. Wonderful, wonderful. I don't want them in this country. Wonderful, wonderful. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, you got to turn these people in. You got to turn -- you know, when you go to San Bernardino, they had bombs all over the floor of the apartment. People saw those bombs. They didn't turn them in. Those people are guilty of a crime believe me. <APPLAUSE> An immigrant from Syria who later applied and received United States citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in Texas and killed three or four American soldiers but preferably execution style. We're dealing with animals -- preferably execution style. A college student who immigrated from Somalia who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship attempted to blow up a Christmas tree with the lighting at a major ceremony in Oregon. An immigrant from Afghanistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship and a legal permanent resident from the Philippines were convicted for plotting to join Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in order to kill as many Americans as possible. Hillary Clinton wants to have them come in by the hundreds of thousands. Just remember, this has nothing to do with politics, folks. This is a whole different level. This has to do with pure raw stupidity, OK? <APPLAUSE> An Iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to ISIS and has traveled to Syria, wanted to kill as many Americans as possible, didn't care how, didn't care how, any way he could do it. Two immigrants from Pakistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship were sentenced to decades-long prison terms for plotting to detonate a bomb in the middle of New York City. An immigrant from Yemen who were, by the way, were fighting -- were fighting. Were working -- we're working with one side. We have no idea who this side is. You know, we spend billions and billions on equipment and guns and rifles, and then the enemy has them. We spend millions and tens of millions of dollars on all of this equipment. And as soon as the shots fired, you know, we always go -- we always seem to pick the wrong side in terms of winning because we don't win anymore. But, you know, Iran is on the other side of that, right? So you say to yourself, why -- you know, they want Yemen because of the border between Saudi Arabia. They don't want Yemen. They want what they want as they want the oil in Saudi Arabia. They have a very beautiful, big, big drill. When they look at it, right? So, here we are, $150 billion, and you say to yourself why, and they ask Secretary of State Kerry, why didn't they solve that problem? We're fighting and our side is fighting people led by Iran. Why didn't you solve that problem? Why didn't you make a deal when you're making this horrible deal that you made while we lost everything? We didn't get anything. That's a deal we didn't get anything. They say nuclear weapons, they'll have nuclear weapons much faster because of that deal than they would have had them otherwise. And now they can buy them with all the money they get and they can buy them. What do they have to do with them? They can buy them. They'll have nuclear weapons. Believe me, I've called a lot of shots right mostly, believe me. Mostly I've called them... <APPLAUSE> ...just about all right, including not going into Iraq in the first place and destabilizing the Middle East. But when Secretary Kerry who is probably better than crooked Hillary, but who knows? They both terrible. But when he said -- and when the president asked them about this, why didn't they solve their problem when they solved the other? He said, ""It got too complicated."" OK, got too complicated. Here's what we have, really complicated, get out. We don't want to fight over there. We're going to solve -- you solve the problem or you don't solve the problem. All right. An immigrant from Yemen who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for trying to join ISIS. He was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms and to try and shoot American military personnel as many as possible. OK. These are people we have coming into our country. And by the way, they are the ones we know about. There are so many that we don't know about. You're going to have problems like you've never seen just like I said. The one thing I predicted, I predict is you're going to have problems like you've never seen. We don't know where these people are. You know, when the government puts them around, we don't even, for the most part, very few people know where they even are. They don't even know where they are located. I'm telling you, I said it before, this could be the great Trojan Horse of all time. They're coming in. They're coming in. <APPLAUSE> And you have many more like that, many more -- thousands, thousands, thousands. We have more people right now being looked at by the FBI and others than we've ever had in the history of our country, OK? And it's impossible to do this. Thousands of people are being looked at and studied, thousands. And this is what we're living with. And she wants to allow 550 percent more than Obama has allowed coming into the country. So if you want to -- if you want to let her do it, folks, that's going to be your choice, but I think you're making a very big mistake. Hillary Clinton, furthermore, can never be trusted with national security. <APPLAUSE> Can't. <APPLAUSE> In fact, we're both supposed to be briefed in a not too distant future, and I'm saying you can't brief her. <LAUGHTER> You can't brief her. Let's protest. Her email scandal put our entire country at risk, made our sensitive secrets vulnerable to hacking by foreign adversaries. I mean, they hacked all over the place. They hacked. I guess, who's got them? She lost 33,000 emails. What happened? Thirty-three thousand, OK. So what -- what happened? How is it possible? First of all, what kind of a number is that? She said it was the wedding and yoga. <APPLAUSE> And then they accused her of lying. They said she lied. They said she was negligent -- all these things. And the other day this weekend, she went out and said, ""No, no, no, I think you must have misunderstood."" She's a big problem. I mean, she's -- she's -- I don't know. There's something going on there. Look, look. She has got a problem. Did you see this weekend when she was interviewed? She said, ""No, I think you misunderstood. No, we're doing a lot."" I've never seen -- has anyone ever seen a liar like that ever before? She's made everybody less safe. Those 33,000 emails are potentially a danger to our country. And if anybody thinks that was for a wedding and for yoga... ...and when she got away with that, I said, that's probably the greatest accomplishment that she has ever had in politics. <APPLAUSE> And I think it's a great insult to our country. I think it's a tremendous insult to our country and to law enforcement. I see policemen and they come up to me, and the policemen like me for whatever reason, OK, maybe because I like them. <APPLAUSE> And they're shaking their head. They're saying, ""Mr. Trump was so embarrassed."" It's such an embarrassment what took place. Thirty-three thousand deleted or gone. Remember they used to say ""wiped the server""? And what about the server? What about the server? How did that happen? How did that happen? And then they put Petraeus and destroyed his life over nothing by comparison and many others. <APPLAUSE> And she walks, and then the president has a meeting for 39 minutes with a very important person in the back of an airplane and they talked about grandchildren and golf. No, it's sad. And then deleted the emails to cover up her crime -- she deleted them to cover up her crime, folks, 100 percent, not 99 percent. <APPLAUSE> A hundred percent. She deleted those emails to cover up what could be a major crime. And it is actually a major crime. I would watch it, I would read, and I found it very interesting. I think the reason Bernie Sanders may be lost because it was so close. And, you know, it's a rigged system to start off with, OK, with the super delegates. <APPLAUSE> And I said he was going to -- but that day in the debate when he said, ""No, no, let's not worry about the emails. Let's get,"" you know, it sounded so nice as a sound bite. Had he gone the other way and had he demanded something, it would have been a whole different story. I think that's when he lost his primary election, I really do. I believe that. <APPLAUSE> So in any line, he did sold out. By the way, no offense, I know we have some Bernie Sanders people here actually. Do we have Bernie Sanders people here? I hear we do, yes. <APPLAUSE> So we're going to get a lot of Bernie Sanders' votes because of trade, because Bernie Sanders was right about one thing that I really believe -- not I believe in, it's a fact. We are dying with our trade deals. Our trade deals are a disaster. Our trade deals with other countries... <APPLAUSE> ...we're going to lose almost $800 billion this year in trade deficits with other countries. China, alone, $500 billion. He was right on that, he was right on that. But had Bernie Sanders not made that deal, and he made the deal with the devil. I've said it before. Had he not made that deal -- and then she picked a vice presidential candidate, Tim Kaine -- Tim Kaine. Now, I thought he'd be a really popular guy because I just left Virginia. I was in Loudoun County, Virginia. We had a tremendous crowd of people -- tremendous crowd, great people. I think that he'd -- you know, really a popular guy. He wasn't popular. You know, when he was governor of Virginia, in the first week, he raised taxes by $4 billion. Does anyone know that? And unemployment doubled. Unemployment doubled under his governorship. I mean -- and I said, oh, gee, are we going to have to sacrifice Virginia? And people said, ""No, I think you probably just won Virginia. He's not popular at all."" <APPLAUSE> Not popular at all. And -- and by the way, we have a great vice president. <APPLAUSE> We have a great -- Mike Pence. <APPLAUSE> Mike Pence from Indiana, AAA rating, one of the most incredible stories for any state. Indiana, great state, great people. Bobby Knight endorsed me. That was the end of that, right? <APPLAUSE> Bobby Knight, great guy. Eight hundred -- 900 wins, but Bobby Knight is terrific, but Indiana, the job that Mike Pence has done there has been amazing. I mean, he's AAA bond rating, you don't see that very often. Not many states have that. Unemployment was just -- it was terrible, it was out of control. Then he -- and the previous Republican governor, good guy. They -- the job they have done has been absolutely astounding. It's one of the reasons I picked it, maybe the primary reason. Now I'm seeing the incredible job he did. He came to me, called me the other day. He said, ""Do you mind?"" because he likes Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan is a good guy actually. Paul Ryan is -- no, he's a good guy. So Mike called me and he said -- yesterday and he said, ""Would you mind if I endorsed?"" I won't do that if it could cause any complications or problems. I would absolutely not. He's the greatest guy. He's the greatest human being. And he said that. He said -- but I like him. He's a friend of mine. ""Would you mind if I endorsed him? And I will not do it if you say no."" I said, ""Mike, you like him? Yes, go ahead and do it 100 percent."" And he endorsed him. <APPLAUSE> And then -- and then we have like a great relationship. It's short but, you know, it hasn't been that long, but I've known him through the campaign and then a couple of the papers, not all of them I must say, most of them wrote it legitimately, but a couple of them said, ""There's a fissure between Pence and Trump. There's a fissure,"" it's so dishonest. These newspapers, the media folks, they are so dishonest. There is nothing so dishonest. There's nothing. <APPLAUSE> Really. So -- so she deleted the emails to cover up her crime. She lied about it all over, and over and over and over. And most recently, she lied to Chris Wallace of Fox. I mean, it was a pure lie. Anybody that saw that interview, they wouldn't even believe it. If I ever did that interview and if I ever gave that answer, I want to tell you I think I'd get the electric chair, I swear. I think I will. <APPLAUSE> It would be headlines all over the world. It's true -- double- standard. This isn't a -- this is a quadruple standard. Seriously, if I ever gave the answer that she gave to Chris Wallace, it would be -- honestly, it would be pretty close to execution. And you know what? Maybe worse, horrible headlines, OK. <LAUGHTER> Horrible. It's amazing. You know, when she said that I said, ""Oh, this is going to be a big story. It's a story, but not very big."" It's lingering though, it's lingering. You know, it's sort of like one of those things. You can't get rid of it, right? It's lingering. But the press wants to get rid of it, but it's lingering and it's out there. She lied -- boy, has she lied. Meanwhile, the Obama-Clinton economic disaster -- it's an economic disaster -- has brought suffering across the nation. Nearly four in 10 African-American youth are living in poverty. Another two million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Nearly one in four people in their prime working years are now not working. You see the numbers. The numbers are very -- they're out there for everyone to see. The Obama-Clinton economy has been a total disaster for all working people, but especially people in the inner cities especially. We're going to bring back our jobs, folks. We're going to bring them back. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton, and I've been saying this for a long time. Hillary Clinton works only for her donors, special interests, and lobbyists. You have lobbyists that have stamped on their forehead I can produce Hillary so -- and they're very good. And they raise millions of dollars. Did you see yesterday it was announced that Hillary Clinton got $48 million or so from hedge funds? And Donald Trump got $18,000 from hedge funds or $19,000. <APPLAUSE> I'm trying to figure out who they were. I want to give it back. <APPLAUSE> Who is it? Folks, folks, look, there was nobody better at the game or certainly much better at the game than I was. I was on the other side for a long time. Don't forget on June 15 I was established <ph>. On June 16, when I announced that I was running coming down that now very famous escalator with Melania, I announced.. <APPLAUSE> ...she did a great job -- did a great job with her speech. She did and Ivanka did, and Eric did, and Don did, and Tiffany did. <APPLAUSE> Great job. They did a great job. Thank you. That's so -- I'm going to tell them about those. I'm going to tell them about this. <APPLAUSE> Wow, that's so nice. That's so nice. I'm going to tell them about this. They'll be happy. They worked hard on it and they were good. They worked hard. I think a couple of them now want to be politicians they felt so good up there, right? I told them don't -- don't do it. It's not. But you know, speaking of politicians, we've created a movement. We have a movement going on like they haven't seen in this country... <APPLAUSE> ...where major anchors and major political figures have said what Trump has done, meaning what we have done together -- it's a movement -- is perhaps the greatest political phenomenon they've seen in their lifetime. <APPLAUSE> And I don't want to think about it. I just want to keep going. But I'll tell you everywhere we go, we have crowds like this. We have -- I mean, it's only constrained by the size of the theater or the arena. You had to see -- honestly, you had to see Florida last night. You had to see -- thank you, I love you, too, darling. <LAUGHTER> You had to see... <APPLAUSE> ...you had to see what was going on in Pennsylvania, the love that was in Pennsylvania who have been stripped of their jobs. The NAFTA -- the NAFTA has been a disaster. Signed by Bill Clinton, the NAFTA has stripped Pennsylvania of so many of their jobs, stripped everybody, stripped you folks, too. But Hillary Clinton works only for our donors and special interests and you know that. And her whole life, the Clinton Foundation -- you ever seen this, the Clinton Foundation like Saudi Arabia gives $25 million of the Clinton Foundation, right? And -- and then you wonder and people naively say, will she be good for the energy business? Yes, she's going to be good for the energy business in Saudi Arabia. She's going to make it impossible for our energy business. And that's the way it works. I mean, it's a sad thing. She is going to be so good for the energy business of Saudi Arabia. Look, taxes, I'm going to cut your taxes in half. <APPLAUSE> We're going to cut your taxes. We have the biggest tax decrease proposed by anybody running for the presidency. That includes all of the Republicans, all of the Democrats. We have the biggest one. We are by far the biggest one. So we're going to have much lower taxes. We're going to cut our taxes very importantly. We're going to cut our taxes for the middle class. We're going to cut our taxes for business. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have massive dollars pouring into this country, and we're going to create jobs like we've never seen before. Taxes are so high... <APPLAUSE> ...that businesses cannot produce jobs. And one other thing, which is actually more important to these people -- to everybody -- regulations. Regulations are so bad they are so out of control that when I go around -- and it surprises me, frankly. When I go around and I look at taxes and regulations, people, if they could only have one, they would cut the massive regulations. They can't start businesses... <APPLAUSE> ...and businesses they have can't thrive. So we're going to take that out, yeah. We're going to take that out. We are going to make our country strong again. We're going to make our country powerful again. <APPLAUSE> You saw the two jetfighters that went down in the last short period of time? They're old, they're old. They're tired. It was just announced today, two fighters went down. They're old. They're tired. These are all fighters. We sell fighters to other nations that are far better than what we have. We don't have -- look, folks. We -- when we fix a part for some of our jetfighters that we're currently using, they have to go to the plane graveyards. They call them airplane graveyards to take them off old planes because they don't make the parts anymore. They're too old. We go to museums and take parts out of planes. This is what we're using to fight. This is the United States of America. This is what we're using. So here's what we're going to do. I've been up here a lot. I've been to Maine a lot. Smaller number of you know what... <APPLAUSE> ...we have a smaller -- what is it, four? Four, right, four. So we have -- but I've been here a lot because we have such incredible people up here. We have people that like Donald Trump... <APPLAUSE> ...like Donald Trump. We have people up here that are very, very proud of their country. They want to see great things happen. They know great things are going to happen. <APPLAUSE> They know great things are going to happen. And -- and they want to see our country be safe, and we want to see safety, but we're going to see many things. We're going to see many things. And we want to see if we can win the whole state. Somebody was saying not four but you'll get one. And somebody else was saying, you know, what, I think you can get all four. <APPLAUSE> I think you can get all four, so we'll see, we'll see. But as everybody knows, and I say it, and nobody ever challenges me. You know, when I was young, I was going to high school, and we had wars, but we never lost a war. We had never lost a war. Then all of a sudden you had the Vietnam War and you had other wars, and you had -- now we never win anything. We never win anything. We don't win anymore. We don't win with trade. We don't win for our Vets. We got to take care of our vets. We got to take great care of our Vets. <APPLAUSE> Our military, we can't beat ISIS. We can't beat ISIS. Can you imagine General Douglas McArthur? Can you imagine General Patton? These were tough, tough cookies. And we had those people, we have them. <APPLAUSE> How about General Flynn? We love General Flynn, right? <APPLAUSE> Mike Flynn. We have those people. But I guess, we're not using them. I guess, we're not using them. We can't defeat ISIS. So here's the story, folks. Yes, we can, you're right. <APPLAUSE> Very quickly. Who said that? That was very good. Thank you. Thanks. So, we're going to start winning again. We're going to win on trade. We're going to win with our military. We're going to knock the hell out of ISIS. We're going to win for our Vets. <APPLAUSE> We're going to win for our Vets. We're going to win at the border and we're going to build this beautiful, beautiful powerful big wall... <APPLAUSE> ...and Mexico is going to pay for that wall. Mexico is going to pay. They know it. Mexico is going to pay for the wall, and that's an easy one. And you know why they're going to pay? Because Mexico is making a fortune, the trade deficit. I'm not talking about the drugs pouring across, OK? We're not even including that -- massive amounts of drugs. You know, when I won New Hampshire, I made a pledge. Who's from New Hampshire here? I love them. So I made a pledge because I went around and it never made sense to me, you know, you see New Hampshire and you don't associate the beautiful streams and -- and all of the beautiful things that you see there, even the little roadways and -- and the forests, the lakes. And I said to the people of New Hampshire, what's the biggest problem? They said heroin. They said heroin. It just doesn't look like it, right? Am I right? And I got to know the people and we had a tremendous victory in - that was my first victory -- first victory politically. <APPLAUSE> Amazing people. And I said to the people of New Hampshire, ""And if I win, we're going to stop this poison from flowing in and destroying your children and others."" <APPLAUSE> And that's what we're going to do. We need to stop it. And then we have to help the people that are hooked because you have many, many people in this community, in New Hampshire, all over -- all over the country not just New Hampshire. But somehow New Hampshire because it just didn't seem like, you know, it's so delicate, so beautiful. This is so beautiful. Who would think that you're loaded up with drugs in Maine, and they're coming mostly from the southern border? We're going to stop it 100 percent. We're going to stop it, we're going to stop it. <APPLAUSE> And then we're going to work with people to get them unhooked. We got to get them unhooked. There's tremendous problems. We got to get them unhooked. And that's all over the country by the way. But I really learned more about that problem from New Hampshire than any place else. So here's the story, folks. We're going to start winning again. We're going to save our Second Amendment. We're going to get rid of common core. You're going to have your education locally. <APPLAUSE> You have your education locally. Save our Second Amendment. And the bottom line is this. You are going to be again very, very proud of your country. <APPLAUSE> Very important. You're going to be hopefully very proud of your president. <APPLAUSE> We're going to win again. We're going to win at every level, and we're going to make America safe again. We're going to make America first. Remember, we don't make America first, not anymore. We don't make America. We're more worried about other nations than we are ourselves, that's why they're ripping us off. We're using the wrong people. We're going to make America first. We are going to make America great again. Thank you. Thank you everybody. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <MUSIC> Thank you everybody. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-10"">
<TRUMP:> Well, thank you very much. And he's not 68-years-old, he's actually 95, right? But he's been mining for 68 years safely. It's fantastic. <APPLAUSE> I thought he looked pretty good at 68. He looks really good at 95, I'll tell you that. So I want to thank everybody. It's fantastic to be here. We've had a tremendous response from the miners. And you look at West Virginia, what happened there during the primaries. It was a massive landslide for Trump. And it was very interesting because after winning New York, here we are standing on 5th Avenue and I said -- and the all <ph> just incredible street of New York. And for some reason, and it had nothing to do with West Virginia, I just said it because I was seeing what was happening with this industry. And I said in this, you know, really such a different location, that we are going to put the miners back to work. And I said that during my speech. And... <APPLAUSE> And by the way -- and I meant it. And then a number of weeks later, I went to West Virginia and we had a big, huge building, actually. And it was packed and there were thousands and thousands of people -- tends of thousands of people outside. And you've never seen so many people. It was like love, like absolute love the way they showed up, the miners. And you know, we did so well there, it was something I won't forget. I mean, it was really incredible. And I pulled over some of the folks because afterwards, I was talking to some of the people and some of the mine owners who have been really decimated and really, in many cases, destroyed by regulation and by what they're doing to the mines. And you look at all the mines that have been closed up. But I brought over some of the miners and we were talking after the speech, and I said, ""Could I ask you like would you ever think of maybe leaving and going into a different industry, going into a different job?"" And they all said -- and I understood this very well because, you know, my father was in real estate, I went into real estate. We sort of do that. They said, ""Mr. Trump, we love mining. We don't want to do anything else. We love mining."" I so understood that. It was so incredible. And they all said it like at the same time. They want to be miners, but their jobs have been taken away and we're going to bring them back, folks. We're going to bring them back. <APPLAUSE> The -- the U.S. -- I just took a look at this. Somebody just handed -- the U.S. has lost nearly 200,000 mining jobs since 2014 -- 2014, and that's not a long period of time; 200,000 jobs.
<TRUMP:> The senator brought up a fact and a couple of the folks brought this up, and it's a fact that nobody's heard. But during times of national problems. We're talking about the defense of our country. Having those minds and having that potential energy source available to us is an awfully important thing. It's an awfully important thing. And nobody thinks in terms of that, they don't think in terms of that. <APPLAUSE> And I fully -- and I fully understand that. But it's been an honor. We just met with some of the folks. We're really representative, I would say. Senator, I would say representatives from every aspect of the business, right? And it was amazing. It was really amazing. These are great people, they're great Americans. They love this country. And if I get in -- if I get in, I mean you know, it's -- it's -- if I get in this is what it is, OK? <APPLAUSE> And -- and other forms of energy, all forms of energy. But what they've done to the minors is incredible and the Obama Administration. And you remember and I think you might've just seen it. <AUDIENCE BOOS> Yes, know what they've done and nobody knows, you know clean call, nobody knows. While you look at what's happening with China, the amount of energy they're producing and what they're using coal for, tremendous amounts of -- just tremendous. It's like incredible. They're not cleaning it. Believe me, they're not cleaning it. We have a small, a very, very small planet compared to the universe, right? And that stuff is going up and they're not cleaning it. And here we produce great stuff and we're not allowed to use it. And its getting worse and worse. So they're gonna be out of business soon. Hillary Clinton will be worse than Obama. You know it, she'll be worse. <APPLAUSE> Don't forget, when she made the statement, gonna put the minds and essentially gonna put the minds and minors out of business, gonna put them out of business. And I guess she forgot about West Virginia, right? She was -- she was going to West Virginia. She forgot about Virginia too, in all fairness, you know. <APPLAUSE> You know, she had -- she had West Virginia right after -- a short time after that. And you remember when she went into West Virginia she met with that wonderful family and the man -- the <ph> miner for many years? And he was trying to explain to her and she was trying to say well, you know I really wanna keep -- she didn't know, she was groveling. She was groveling, she didn't know what to say. I don't think he was going to be easily convinced, do we agree? Because she said it just like she said and you know she said it was a mistake that she's going to raise taxes in the middle class, you saw that one? Now, maybe she misspoke. I mean we have to give them a break. But it did come out awfully loud and clear, I -- I don't know. Hey look, hopefully it won't matter, OK? Hopefully it's not gonna matter because she's not gonna get <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> But what I told -- what I told the folks before, we were over at Peterbilt <ph> the plant, incredible. But what I told -- what I told the folks before is -- is that you have to get our and vote. Because the minors to a certain extent they are so down and they've been treated so badly that they haven't been voting. They haven't been going out and voting like they can. And that includes members of their family that have left the mining business, let members of the family -- they've left coal. They've left everything. And they've gotten into something else and that's fine, that's great.
<TRUMP:> But they live in Virginia and they vote. And their parents are still in the coal world where they wanna be and that's where they wanna be. But everybody has to get out and vote. If you get out and vote, we're pretty close in Virginia and she's spending a fortune in ads. A friend of mine said he can't see television without seeing anti-Trump ads. And they're not even true. My friend actually said they're not true. I said, ""I know."" I could go over those ads one by one and show you the - it's fraudulent, actually. But, what are you going to do? She's spending Wall Street money on ads. And it's just one after another, after another. And this guy kiddingly said, ""I just want to see one Ivory soap ad. One."" Just to break it. And we haven't spent anything yet. We will be, because we're doing well. But we haven't spent anything yet; we're holding it. But it's really - it's really a shame that they can say whatever they want to say. They try and demean and defame. And then you look at what she's doing with her e-mails. 33,000 missing e-mails. Yeah, 33,000. It's - it's very sad. And then I guess yesterday, 1,000 came out or something - some fairly vast number. Oh, I want to see the ones - the - what I really would like to see the - we have to see the 33,000. Can you imagine? Remember, she said I think it was for her wedding - the wedding of Chelsea. And it was for yoga classes. 33,000 e-mails. It's a lot of yoga - it's a lot of yoga. But a couple of very bad ones came out. And it - it's called pay for play. And some of these were really, really bad and illegal. But it's true, it's illegal. You're paying and you're getting things. I mean I watched yesterday, because of the Apprentice, Blagojevich, right, Governor Blagojevich - 14 years in jail. And you know some people think OK, some people think it's crazy. Look at what she's done - nothing. She's running for president. But it came out to her people, pay for play. And very big stories today. The problem is, it'll be big stories for about two minutes, and then they're going to drop it because the media is so totally dishonest - so totally... <APPLAUSE> If that were me - if that were me, the story that just came out this morning - and really, hidden from some of the major newspapers - hidden. If that were me, that would be biggest story in the history of the various papers. They go quadruple spacing, bomb <ph> Trump. But with her, it's - it's just - I mean it - it's - I mean some of them covered it - big league. But some of them are just refusing to really report the facts. And I think it's gonna get worse and worse though because I assume more stuff will come out. But this was big stuff. Pay for play - it's illegal. I mean it's illegal. And we'll see what happens with it, folks. We'll see what happens with it. But it's very serious stuff. It's very, very serious. I don't know that it can be any more serious than deleting or getting rid of 33,000 e-mails, and all of the other things - the server - the server, which not allowed to have. The information gotten off that servers by who knows who, probably many people - many countries, potentially. Secretary of State to put us all in that position. So I think it's a very sad thing.
<TRUMP:> And they give her a pass on everything. Give her a pass. It's so sad when I watch that. And it was point, after point, after point. And everybody was saying wow, they're really going to do it. And then they go, however - as soon as I heard - you know, when you hear the word ""however."" But it's just -- it's just so incredible that a thing like that could happen. So let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. In the meantime, we're doing very well. You saw the polls over the last day or two have really tightened up a lot. I think we're going to have a great victory. I really feel it. <APPLAUSE> One of -- one of the things I suggested is your ballots. You go and sign -- do it early so you don't have to -- because on November 8th, we have our big day. And if you go in an sign, we have some people in the room now that I've met before that are going to be pushing hard. But put in your ballots. They have certain requirements and you live by those requirements perfectly. Make sure they don't lose your ballot. Make sure they don't lose your vote, which I'm sure -- you know, and I just left a great place, North Carolina. And they just had a tremendous loss -- voter ID, voter ID. They lost voter ID. How do you lose voter ID? You mean, you don't have to show identification? You don't have to show that, hey? And then you say -- you know, I've been talking about the rigged system for a long time. And I get hammered in the press for talking about it. Oh, I can't believe he'd be talking about the rigged system. And then in the meantime, voter ID, you don't have to do. And I'm sure none of those folks would be voting 10 times during one day, right? I'm sure a thing like that... <LAUGHTER> But I get -- and really, a big part of the rigged system is the press itself because they can take a little story, that isn't a story, and make it into a big deal. It happens so much, happens so much. And speaking of that, remember this. We have so many things that we have to protect in this country. We have to protect our Second Amendment, which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> Remember that. Remember that. It's under siege. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have to -- you know, I see -- and by the way, we have a lot of unity in the Republican Party, but nobody talks about it. If one senator says we're not voting for Trump, never Trump, some people were beaten so badly that they, you know, they just can't get it. And I understand that. I mean, I can see that could happen. So, you know, they've won throughout their lives politically, and then they lose an election by a lot to a guy that never ran before. OK? I never ran before. Never thought I'd be doing it this time, either, but I watch what's going on and I say, it's time. <APPLAUSE> It's time. Boy is it time, right? <APPLAUSE> You know, I look at the Iran deal. How about the $400 million in cash? How about that? How about that? The $400 million -- do you know what that is? Does anybody know what that would even look like -- 400? And did you see Iran actually finally did do what I thought they were going to do. They released pictures, because they want to embarrass the United States, just like they took the 10 sailors and they made us look so bad. They made us look so bad. It was like a humiliation of our country.
<TRUMP:> OK? This is horrible. And then we keep going and going. And you saw what their so-called leader -- somebody would say the supreme leader. I refuse to use that term. President Obama would say the supreme leader. What is going on, folks? What is going on with our leaders? And with our leader, in particular? He is grossly incompetent. OK? Grossly incompetent. <APPLAUSE> So -- so their <ph> $400 million in cash going, it happens to be the same day as the hostages were released. The hostages were in the airport for massive amounts of time. And I guess one of them said they wouldn't let us go because they were waiting for a certain plane to come in. And I just can't imagine what was on that plane, right? We can't imagine. I'm sure it had nothing to do with the $400 million. But isn't that unbelievable? And then he'll stand up and he'll say that one thing had nothing to do with the other. And then practically I guess you could say there's a one or two percent chance that you know, what he said is right. But that's about it. They would practically -- they're saying -- they're waiting for something else and a plane to come in, right? And they were at the airport forever. And they say and President Obama said no, this had nothing to do with the hostages. And you know if you remember with Obamacare, he said you can keep your plane, you can keep your doctor. You have your doctor, you have your plan -- how many times he said it, 28 times or something? And many Democrats approve that disaster, it's a disaster. We're gonna repeal it and replace it <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> But many, many Democrats -- many, many Democrats would not have -- you know, won by almost nothing, the margin was almost nothing. And a lot of Democrats approved it, they didn't want to approve it. But you know, with the doctor and the plan and over and over again a lot of pressure put on. And it's out of control. Premiums are going up at a rate that nobody has ever seen before. You know, in Texas through Blue Cross Blue Shield they just had almost a 50 percent increase. And they -- the big increase is now going to come on November 1st. And they're trying to delay it 'till after the election because it is catastrophic. It is going to be an increase like never before. I'm hearing numbers that I don't even wanna say because the press will say oh, that's terrible, he exaggerated. There's not gonna be an exaggeration. Its going to be election changing. And we can't let those numbers be released on another date sometime after the election. Because it will show what a total disaster Obamacare is, so important. So I just say to all of the politicians in the room and your great congressman who is a terrific guy -- where is he by the way <inaudible>? Oh, congressman stand up. Stand up. <APPLAUSE> Vote for him, he's out guy. <APPLAUSE> Stand up Senator, come on Senator. <APPLAUSE> Now, we have -- we have great people, here. So right now they're swimming uphill but with Trump we'll be just sliding beautifully down. It'll be a whole different deal. It'll be a whole different deal. And it can happen quickly. It can happen -- we discussed that, we had a big meeting and we discussed it. It's gonna happen very quickly it doesn't need to go through Congress and doesn't need to go through lots of different things. EPA is very important what they've done and we want -- everybody agrees? We want clean air and we want clean water, do we agree? I want. <APPLAUSE> So I very much appreciate the meeting, it was a great meeting. I just wanna say that Virginia has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Now, NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton. NAFTA is a disaster.
<TRUMP:> It's been a disaster not only for Virginia but for virtually every state. Upstate New York, it looks like a war zone. That's why I won so much and I go the upstate vote in numbers that nobody's seen before. Upstate New York, you go to New England, you see the factories, these beautiful old factories that you see they were once thriving. Thousands and thousands of people working and those people now are doing part time jobs. They're working two jobs, they're making less money than they made 18 years ago. I don't know if you saw that statistic where people, and people in this room too, but where people are making less money now in real wages than they made 18 years ago and even longer. And they've gotten older, gotten older, and they're working harder, not supposed to be that. It's supposed -- hey, of course I've gotten older and I'm working harder too to be honest with you. <LAUGHTER> I didn't need this. I could have enjoyed myself a lot. <APPLAUSE> Oh, getting older, we're working -- it's supposed to be the other way, right? We're getting older and starting to relax. No, it's not work, I don't know, I don't know that like that -- I love what I'm doing. I have been all over this country. We have the greatest people. Anywhere in the world, the greatest people. <APPLAUSE> And I have the greatest supporters. We have the most loyal supporters and the smartest. You know they always like demean everything, they try to demean supporters, they're always trying to put a little knock, you know little shots, boom, boom, boom. We've got the smartest, we've got the most loyal, we've got the hardest working, we have the best people. They like to demean. <APPLAUSE> But we have amazing, just amazing people and I've seen this all over the country and we can start making Apple computers in our country, OK folks? We can start building, we can start building. <APPLAUSE> You know we go to China, and you'd think even the shipping costs, when you just think of it, the shipping costs, I mean how much of a difference, we can -- and you bid it all to different states and you'll get the good deal from somebody, just keep it in our country. When they close plants and they move to Mexico and then a company builds in Mexico, whatever product they're making and then they think they're going to sell the product back into the United States. All of their people have been fired, every single one of them have been fired. And they're now using people from another nation to make the same product. And you know what, they think they're going to sell it across our border, which by the way will become a very powerful, very strong border, OK it's no long going to be a piece of Swiss cheese. <APPLAUSE> And they think they're going to sell it across the border. No tax, no nothing, sell it to wherever it came from. Let the people that got laid off buy it and now maybe they're unemployed, maybe they're two jobs, and they're making less, right, as we said. And, not going to happen folks. And I've watched for years as our government, which is I guess you could say stupid, but honestly not so stupid. They're controlled by special interests. When you see companies moving over to Mexico, and other places... <APPLAUSE> They're controlled by special interests. They're controlled by lobbyists, they're controlled their donors who have big chunks of companies or own the whole company. Because these aren't stupid people, our politicians. Some are but we have a genius right over here, that's all I care. Some are, but a lot of them are just controlled because that's the way the system works. So you think that, you know, like a friend of mine asked me a few weeks, how did a deal like this get approved? It's impossible. Unless -- you know there's no way, there's a certain deal that happened with the government. And he said how is it possible? And he's a little naive and I said well it's possible because that company has total control over the politicians that have to approve.
<TRUMP:> Now, I spent like over $50 million, substantially over 50 million in the primaries, my own money. I spent a lot of money now in the general election and I'm spending a lot of money for myself. We're also raising a lot of money. We're also getting a lot of money. Don't worry. You don't have to give. Don't give. We're going to straighten this place out. OK? We're going to straighten this place out. But, you know, we have a lot of small donors -- $61, I think, average. We raised millions of dollars. In June, we raised actually $51 million, of which like $27 million was small donors -- $27 million. <APPLAUSE> And last month, we raised $82 million, of which much of it was small -- I love the small donations -- to me, the best. And so I'm spending a lot of money from myself. I'm raising a lot of money for the Republican Party. But the beautiful thing is the people that are giving those small dollar donations -- $61 average -- because those people are invested in the campaign. They want to see -- they get out and vote 100 percent. They get out there and they vote, and it's so important. And a Republican generally doesn't have that. You know who had it? Bernie Sanders had it. He raised a lot of money with that. And we have a different side of the ledger, but we have the same thing. I mean, we have a tremendous amount. People are shocked. In fact, newspapers that truly hate me put it on the front page. They couldn't believe that. They actually were very nice about it. Because, you know, the month before, we raised nothing. I wanted to make sure I got the nomination, if you don't mind. OK. You know. I wasn't going to go wild. But once we started, we started in June. And in June, I think we did $51 million and then we did $82 million, and now we have very good numbers coming in again. So we're -- we're equipped. We have to get the people out. We have to get them out to vote. But we're equipped. We're going to do a job for you folks and you're going to be really happy in Virginia. OK? <APPLAUSE> And I'm not only talking, by the way, I'm not only talking about the miners. I'm talking about the whole state. Because look, Virginia has lost one in three manufacturing jobs, right, since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton. A disaster. Didn't hurt him. It hurt every other president. That's where the country emptied out. Without an agreement, even aside <ph> the existing U.S. trade deficit, with TPP. TPP -- it's a disaster. Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disaster. It will be as bad, if that's possible. I think NAFTA is the worst economic development deal ever signed by any country, anywhere in the world. That's how bad it is. <APPLAUSE> And you know, I said, and it's part of my platform. I made a speech the other day, some of you saw it. I said we're going to renegotiate NAFTA. And they said, well supposedly, they don't renegotiate. I said that's OK, then we're going out. We're out of it. Because it's sucking our jobs out of the country. I tell this story because it's such a perfect story. I could go out and hire a consulting firm, pay them a million dollars, and they'll spend months, you know, telling me what's going on with here and Mexico and the different places. Right? But I have much better. I have a friend who builds plants. I say, how are you doing? He said unbelievable. I said, great, it's going well inn the United States? He's a U.S. guy. He loves this country. He said, no, Donald, it's going unbelievable in Mexico. He said we're building some of the greatest plants in the world. He said -- he called it the eighth wonder of the world. He said Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world. I said, how about here? He said, not so good, not so good. Can you believe this? He's an American guys. He wants to build here. But just through years and years -- I think he's the biggest in the world with plants, or just one of them. But he builds plants. And he's really -- he can't believe what's going on in Mexico. Now, that's better than hiring the consulting firm and saying, tell me how we're doing against Mexico. I mean, I know the answer, because he can give me the answer better than any guy that graduated from the Wharton School of Finance that you're paying a lot of money, and he'll go around and do surveys, right?<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> It's common sense. And it costs me nothing. Right? But that's what's happening. That's what's happening. So not only is it the miners, it's -- you know, you look at manufacturing jobs are gone. But NAFTA's one of the worst deals ever signed by our country, certainly the worst in terms of economic development, what it's done to us. The destruction of manufacturing in Virginia was caused by Bill Clinton's signing of NAFTA. And then she'll come along. And she had a very interesting thing because two days ago in The Washington Post -- I was shocked. In fact, I had to read the story twice to believe it. They did a story on -- a big story. She was a senator form New York and she made tremendous -- you know, tremendous promises of what she was going to do for New York when she became senator. And she won the race and she was a disaster. We lost jobs, tremendous numbers of jobs. She said she's going to help rebuild upstate New York and all these places where all these jobs were taken because of NAFTA and bills that her husband signed. The whole thing. But she said she was going to do a great job and it was a disaster. She was going to create I think it was 200,000 jobs, 200,000 jobs. It was negative. It went to hell. It's all talk. It's all talk. <APPLAUSE> And now, she's doing the same thing. She's going to make a job speech or something tomorrow, a speech on the economy. Look at what she did during her term as senator. Take a look at what happened during her first term. Take a look at what happened. Take a look at the results. What she said -- of all newspapers, it was the Washington Post that did it. It was like the most devastating article. In fact, I think I'm going to use it on my stump speech because you can't -- it just doesn't get any worse. She promised the world and it went -- went like this. It went down. And she got virtually no legislation passed. She couldn't get anything passed. It was unbelievable. At the same time, or similar time a little while ago, they had an article about Donald Trump and what I did for New York and Manhattan and the buildings and the revitalization and all of that. I mean, they gave me a lot of credit for getting it all started and doing great jobs. And I don't want to brag about it, but I'm contrasting that... <APPLAUSE> And that's what we have to do for our country. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. We have to bring trade back. We have to bring jobs back to this country. We have to bring jobs back to our country. We're losing our jobs. I mean, frankly... <APPLAUSE> Frankly, any form of energy -- and we're losing our factories and we're losing our jobs and we're losing millions of jobs and we're losing thousands and thousands of companies. And they're leaving and they're going to other places. I mean, in particular, in terms of manufacturing, they're going into Mexico. Look at what's happening with Michigan, where Ford and others are building these massive car plants in Mexico. Folks, they're going to build cars and under Clinton, they're going to just build them there and let them come roaring in and all those jobs -- thousands of jobs. Over 100,000 jobs gone in Michigan -- car jobs. All car jobs. And -- and I'm going in front of Michigan. I think we have a good chance of winning Michigan, I think, because I've been talking about this for years. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary wouldn't know what to do. So I just ask people when she makes her speech tomorrow or whenever she's doing it, she'll stand at the teleprompter, she'll spin around a couple of times. Always a very short speech. Then she gets off the stage, she goes back home, she goes to sleep.<LAUGHTER>
<TRUMP:> When she's -- when she makes her speech tomorrow -- very limited time. Did you ever notice? Very limited. Everything's very limited. No -- no effort, no time. Great effort, but doesn't spend any time. She'll make a speech and you'll see her a little while later. I mean, take a look during the primaries. Take a look at the whole thing. When she goes out and she makes her speech on economic development or on trade or on the economy or whatever she's going to be talking about refer yourself to yesterday. Take a look at the Washington Post. Take a look at the promises she made as a senator from New York and the jobs she was going to create. Take a look at what happened. It is a wasteland, what's happened up there. Our jobs got sucked away from us. Our factories are falling down, just from the rain and the wind, the ice, the snow. They're falling down. These plants are falling down. And you could envision 30, 40 years ago, 25 years ago, vibrancy. And now take a look. But you have to read this story. And I think the biggest shock -- if I read the story anywhere else, because I know the story. I mean, I now she did nothing. She had three minor bills passed. One was the naming of a building, and very little stuff. She did nothing. But if this were in any other paper, it probably wouldn't have made such a big impact. But this in the Washington Post, one of the most dishonest papers in the world in terms of me <ph>, what they say. <APPLAUSE> You know <inaudible>. The New York Times actually did a story, and this is sort of amazing. They actually said in way that they're biased toward me. They actually said it. They said we hate him so much. Essentially, they say we hate him so much, we're going to be biased. And most people have never seen a story like that. Even I was surprised. You know, normally you'd think they wouldn't want to admit it. They practically admitted it, but you look at it. But look at the Washington Post from two days ago. Look at the story on Hillary Clinton. Compare that with what she says tomorrow. We're never going to let her escape it. Because everything she says is all talk, no action. It's all talk. It's no action. <APPLAUSE> And the funny thing is that she put in a pretty unpopular guy, right? A pretty unpopular guy. So you have Bernie Sanders, who had big -- almost 50 percent of the vote and the whole thing was rigged -- the super delegates and everything else. But regardless, but he did a good job. The nice thing about Bernie's people is that they agree with me on one thing -- trade. Because he was so against what was going -- these bad trade deals. He just bought a $600,000 house, so he knows something about what's going on. You know, he's got some sense, right? But -- but about trade, we're in agreement. Now, the difference is I can do something about it. He would not be able to. He'd end it. I want to have trade with other countries, but I want to make great deals for our country. I want to make great deals for our country. <APPLAUSE> But she -- she took a person -- did you see how angry he was at the convention? He was so angry because he made a deal. And he made a deal that he wished, in my opinion, he wished he didn't make. Because his legacy would have been amazing if he didn't make a deal. It would have been a lot different. And on top of everything else, instead of appointing someone that is a little bit like, at least representative of that big faction of the party -- 45 percent. Instead of doing that, she appoints Tim Kaine. OK? Tim Kaine. <AUDIENCE BOOS> You can't get more different. During Tim Kaine's tenure as governor of Virginia, from 2006 -- and you all remember, right? -- it was a disaster -- to 2010, the unemployment rate of Virginia more than doubled. Other than that, he's doing great. <LAUGHTER> Now, compare that with Mike Pence of Indiana. He did incredible. He's also incredible. <APPLAUSE> He's doing great. And the state's going great -- AAA bond rating -- doing great. And I'll tell you what, Mike Pence really has been fantastic. During Tim Kaine's tenure as governor, the state of Virginia lost 60,000 manufacturing jobs. During Tim Kaine's tenure as governor of Virginia, it averaged only 1.1 percent in real GDP growth. Less than a week after Tim Kaine became governor of Virginia, he proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase, including a tax increase on people earning as little as $17,000 a year. So everybody felt the brunt <ph>. And I could go on and on. It's -- I could just go on and on talking about his transportation disasters, everything else. And I watched him the other day and he was saying -- you know, he's won elections, but they've always been very close. He said, ""Every election I win is very close."" That's not a good thing, right? In other words, they were so razor thin. And then I said let me check. And I called up some friends and I -- you know, when they first picked him, I said, ""Oh by, that's going to be tough,"" because we're doing -- we've got to win Virginia. I want to win Virginia. <APPLAUSE> And -- and what happened is -- so during -- during this period of time, I'm saying -- call up a friend, a friend calls me, three of four people call me. I have a lot of property in Virginia. You know, in Charlottesville, we have the property on the Potomac River -- Potomac Falls, Sterling, Loudon County. We love Loudon County. We have a lot of stuff. We employ a lot of people in Virginia. It's a great place. Great -- I don't know if you know my Charlottesville place, but it's a fantastic place. It's now a winery. It's one of the largest wineries on the east coast. We have a lot of employees there. They're going great <inaudible> Virginia wine, which has become a very big thing. And... <APPLAUSE> So I have a big -- I have a big stake in Virginia. We have a lot of -- a lot of different property in Virginia. These two places are incredible. They're incredible places. But I figured she was going to pick somebody that was unbelievable. So I heard she picked somebody from Virginia, an ex- governor. I said, ""Oh man, that's going to be tough. We've got to beat somebody"" -- he raised your taxes by $4 billion in his first week. <LAUGHTER> He had negative growth. I mean, think of it. He raised your taxes by $4 billion. It was like a catastrophic governorship. And I don't get it. I don't get it. And everybody said to me, yeah, he wasn't very popular. And then I heard him talking how he's won races and every time, he prides himself on having just won. So I actually think he's going to be a negative in Virginia, not a positive. I really do. <APPLAUSE> I really do. But you know what? I wish him luck. I wish him luck. Whatever, whatever. But look, here's the story, folks. We have an election which is I think going to be the most -- and I know they say this -- everybody says it every four years. I thought it actually four years ago. But this is going to be -- I think it's our last shot. I know this. It is the last shot for the miners. It is the last for the miners. That I know. That I know. <APPLAUSE> And I'm not like a neutral for the miners. I'm not like, ""Oh, well he'll be all right."" Hillary will be a horror show and I'm going to be an unbelievable positive, but this is the last shot. Every -- the mines will be gone. The mines will be gone if she gets elected. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> I believe -- I honestly believe she'll be worse than Obama and I honestly -- I know that when she made the statement not so long ago about the miners and the mines are going to be gone, that was a statement that she believes. That was the real truth. That was -- it wasn't sitting down talking to the guy who's such a good guy. I've seen him on other programs and really a good representative in so many ways. But that's -- that's the real Hillary and that's what she's going to do. And she'll probably come in and she'll probably come down and see you. And she'll say oh well, I actually think -- she's -- believe me, folks. That's where she is. I hope you understand that these politicians can say anything they want and get away with it. It's really disgusting, OK? It's really disgusting. <APPLAUSE> So we're going to open up, we're going to do such a good job. And you know, I understand, you know, I grew up -- my father was a real estate -- I grew up with the carpenters, I grew up with the sheetrockers, I grew up with the plumbers and the policemen and the firemen and the whole thing. That's what I grew up with. <APPLAUSE> People say gee whiz, you're a rich guy but you get along very well with a lot of carpenters and a lot of electricians. I said yeah, that's what I did, you know, I mean that's what I did. And these are amazing people. The miners are amazing people, so. <APPLAUSE> So I -- I really -- and I say it, it's up to you. You've got to get out and vote. You just don't vote, you know? I don't know why. And I think it's because you've been beaten so badly as an industry, just beaten up so badly. I was talking about it with your congressmen. Just beaten up so badly that you just don't want to do it. And I can understand. You've got to do it. We've got to give it one shot, you know? Takes you 25 minutes or two minutes or 10 minutes. <APPLAUSE> You have nothing to lose. You have absolutely nothing to lose, believe me. You will be happy. You will be happy. You will be absolutely happy. So just a couple of other things. Immigration. We've got to have strong borders or we don't have a country. <APPLAUSE> Got to have strong borders. <APPLAUSE> We are going to have a strong border. We are going to have a strong southern border. We are taking in drugs and you're having the problem here big league <ph>. Up in New Hampshire where I won the primary, I got to know the people so well. And their number one problem they told me is heroin. I said heroin? Just doesn't go with the territory. These beautiful trees and lakes and rivers and so beautiful. Heroin? And it is their number one problem. And now, so many people, their youth is so addicted. And we've got to take care of that. We've got to stop it from coming in, comes in from the southern border. And I got the -- you probably heard. The border patrol agents, 16,500 border patrol agents endorsed Donald Trump and they've never done it before for a president. <APPLAUSE> They've never done it before in a presidential -- 16,500. Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, great guy. He endorsed Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE> He probably knows borders better than anybody in the history of the world, right? Sheriff Joe, he's a great guy too. But he endorsed us and we've got to have borders. We've got to stop the drugs from coming in. We've got to stop illegal immigration. You know, illegal immigrants -- and we will build a wall, don't worry about it, we're going to build a wall. Going to have to, going to have to. <APPLAUSE> We're going to build a wall and Mexico's going to pay for the wall. They're going to pay for it. <APPLAUSE> Just so you understand -- look, some of these politicians would get off stage with me and they'd say you know that you can't build a wall. I said really? China just built 2,000 years ago.<LAUGHTER>
<TRUMP:> China built a wall 2,000 years ago, 13,000 miles. We have 2,000 miles of which we really need 1,000 miles because you have a lot of natural barriers -- lot of natural barriers. So you need a 1,000. But we have -- 2,000 years ago, a wall was built, the Great Wall of China. This is a serious wall. OK? This is a very serious wall. And we have to build 1,000 and we have Caterpillar tractors. We have Caterpillar tractors. <APPLAUSE> Not Komatsu. We have Caterpillar. We don't <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> No, no. We have Caterpillar. We're going to start -- remember the old days? Made in the USA, right? Remember, they used to have Made in the USA. We don't have it anymore. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have signs just like, you know, they made these signs. I love them, too. But we're going to have signs -- look how beautiful on both sides. See? We cover them both. You like yellow. You like black. Yellow, black -- beautiful. We cover a lot of territory, right <inaudible>? What a good looking group of people <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> They'll be so happy in a year from now. They'll be so happy. It's going to go fast. <APPLAUSE> But I will say that -- so we have to build the wall. And we're going to build the wall. But, you know, the politicians would tell me, you can't build a wall. Really, can you build a wall? They don't know. I mean, I built 90-story buildings. Building buildings is tough. Building a wall, boy, is that easy. Pre-cast -- pschoom <ph>. And every time they fight me, it gets 10 feet taller, right? Every single time it gets 10 feet taller. It goes up. It goes up, up, up. The taller it gets, the safer it gets. <APPLAUSE> No, we're going to have a wall. And we're going to let people come into our country because we want people to come into our country. But they're going to come into our country legally -- legally. <APPLAUSE> And then I said Mexico's going to pay for the wall. Now, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of like close to $60 billion a year. Think of it. Mexico. They're making a fortune. So these politicians say -- because it's not their deal. It's not their deal. These politicians say, well, OK, maybe you can build it. But how are you going to get Mexico to pay? When you are losing so much money on trade, like we lose to Mexico, it's easy. The wall is peanuts compared to the kind of numbers we're talking about, where they're taking our jobs and building factories. So easy. But they don't know that. They don't know, because they don't have that instinct. It's not that they're bad people. Although in many cases, again, they're controlled by people that don't want to see the wall. There are a lot of people that don't want to see that wall built. And those are people that have reason to not want the wall built. And in many cases, again, they're representing their special interest groups, their lobbyists. Their donors are representing companies where it's not to the advantage to have the wall built. But we're going to build the wall. We're going to stop drugs from coming in. We're going to stop all of this illegal immigration. And I see a lot of military guys in the room. We have illegal immigrants treated better than our vets in many cases. <APPLAUSE> And that's going to stop. <APPLAUSE> We have vets that are treated so badly, the Veterans Administration is a disaster. We're going to take care of our vets. Our military is depleted. It's depleted. We're going to build up our military. We're using fighters that are 18 years old where they can't even get parts. They have to go to airplane graveyards to get parts for our fighter jets. Two went down last week. You saw that. So we're going to make a lot of changes, folks; going to make a lot of changes. So we have, just to sum up, Obamacare out. <APPLAUSE> Repeal and replace. Very important. Common Core -- we want education local. We're getting rid of Common Core.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We're getting rid of Common Core. And it's obviously not working. Look at what's happening with our education. Look at where we're ranked worldwide. It's not working, folks. We don't need bureaucrats in Washington telling us how to educate our children in Virginia, OK? <APPLAUSE> So we don't need it. Bureaucrats that make a lot of money, by the way. We're going to have strong borders. We're going to make great, great trade deals. We're going to bring jobs back. We're going to make money. We're going to make money for our country. We need money. We're losing a fortune. We're losing almost $800 billion. Think of it, $800 billion a year trade deficits worldwide, $800 billion. It's going to end, folks. It's going to end. We're going to have great relationships with these countries and we're going to trade with these countries, but it's going to be a two- way street, not a one-way street. Right now, it's a one-way street. <APPLAUSE> It's a one-way street to unemployment. They're stripping us. They're stripping us of our jobs, they're stripping us of our money. They're taking our manufacturing -- I mean, every time I come to a location, I have statisticians and they give me these numbers. I don't even need the statisticians no matter where I go. I mean, manufacturing way down, always way down. Not going up, it goes down. Keeps going to down. They're moving to other places. They're moving to other countries. They're moving a lot to Mexico. It's not going to happen anymore, folks. We're going to keep our companies and if they want to move, that's OK, but there is going to be retribution. It's going to be -- there are going to be consequences -- going to be consequences. <APPLAUSE> They want to sell product into our country, they're going to fire all our people. They want to sell product into our country, they're going to have to -- sadly, they're going to have to pay. You know, I use the case of Carrier. Every single air conditioning unit they make in Mexico, they're going to pay a 35 percent tax. And you know? You know what's going to happen? <APPLAUSE> Now, a lot of people don't like to hear that. A lot of the conservatives -- you know the conservatives. You know what's amazing to me? When I say I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA and make it into a good deal from a disastrous deal -- now, you always have to be prepared to walk, so there's a good chance we'll have to walk. But I'm going to make it into a good deal as opposed to a bad deal. I get bad stories <ph>. They said that's terrible. He's going to -- I'm like why? What's terrible? I want to make it a good deal. When I say I want to get the NATO countries to pay up -- they're not paying, right? They're not paying. Many of them. They're not paying what they're supposed to be paying. <APPLAUSE> So what I have -- we're supposed to protect these countries. They're taking advantage of the United States. And I think NATO's a good thing. But they're taking advantage of the United States. They're not paying what they're supposed to be paying. Maybe they're not being asked properly. But they're not paying. So we protect countries that aren't paying. They've got to pay up. And you know what they -- the money, if you add it all up, you know the kind of numbers we're talking about in this country? I mean, we go from a country that's really bust to a country that can just be incredible -- incredible. And then I'll get people saying I don't like NATO. I think NATO's wonderful. It was obsolete. I said ti was obsolete because it wasn't covering terrorism properly. And they all laughed and they smiled. They said, ""Donald Trump said it's obsolete."" Well, I'm not a great expert on NATO, but I have a lot of common sense, said it was obsolete. And I also said countries aren't paying up, those two things. But it was obsolete because it wasn't covering terrorism. And then about four months ago, there was a front page story in the Wall Street Journal. Got a lot of publicity. They smiled and, you know, said, ""Trump said it's obsolete about terrorism,"" this and that. A lot of them left the terrorism part out. Then, about three months ago, front page here in the Wall Street Journal. NATO to develop terrorism unit. Wow. I said, ""Thank you."" That's good. <APPLAUSE> They gave me a tiny little mention, like about a quarter of a sentence. ""Donald Trump was unhappy."" But they gave me like a quarter of a sentence. That's OK. Big progress, right? Big progress. So we all know what we're doing. So here's the story. We're going to start winning again as a country. We don't win anymore. We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to build up our military. We're going to do a lot of great things. <APPLAUSE> We've got to fix our infrastructure. We're going to fix our infrastructure so those Peterbilt's aren't going to be running over potholes and having lots of problems. Right? You know what I'm talking about. A friend of mine in the trucking business said the roads have never, ever been so bad. You know that, right? That the roads have never, ever been so bad. He buys beautiful new equipment and he said what these drivers go through with the potholes and the problems and the bad roads, he said, it's never been like this. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. We have to fix our bridges, our tunnels, our highways, our roads, our hospitals, our schools. We have so much to do. We've spent -- we've spent in the Middle East -- it used to be -- thank you -- it used to be -- I've been saying for years -- $2 trillion in Iraq. Iraq. We shouldn't have been in Iraq. I said don't go to Iraq; you're going to destabilize the Middle East. That's exactly what happened, and a lot of other things happened. Hillary Clinton's policies have been a disaster from the time she got -- look at Libya. What did we get out of Libya? I mean, that's been a disaster. You look at what she's done. You look at the bad decisions that she's made. You look at the bad judgment. Like Bernie Sanders said, she's got bad judgment. You look at the bad judgment. And now we're going to put her in charge of our country? We won't have a country left. <APPLAUSE> So I just ask the people of Virginia and the people in this room and in particular because we're in such a mining area, give it one more chance. I know you're discouraged. Give it one more chance. If you're not feeling good, if you're so sick you can't move, if your wife got angry at you and you don't want to get out of the house, say I'm sorry -- I'm just sorry, Charlotte. I'm going out to vote for Trump. <APPLAUSE> You have to vote. Give it -- seriously -- give it one more chance. Go out and sign those early ballots. Go out and vote on November 8th. You can sign the ballot and you don't even have to, but give it one more chance. I promise you, you will be happy. OK, fellows? These are tough cookies. I don't want to -- I'm not lying to these guys. <APPLAUSE> All right. You've got to get them out <inaudible>. Give it one more chance. And we're going to start winning again as a country. We're going to start winning again. We're going to win in so many different ways. We're going to make America great again. We're going to make America first. And we're going to make America safe again. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, everybody. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you, everybody. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-12"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you. What a beautiful crowd. Thank you. Thank you. What a group. Thank you. So, you know, outside we have a lot of people trying to get in. And downstairs, there's a room and it is loaded with people. It's almost this size. <APPLAUSE> And we're really -- we're really doing a job. So important to win the state of Pennsylvania. We're going to bring your jobs back. We're not going to let your jobs be taken from you. We are not going to let your jobs leave, folks. We're not going to let it happen. They're not going to Mexico. They're not going anywhere else. Your companies are going to stay, we're going to make them happy, we're cutting their taxes, we're cutting your taxes. Hillary... <APPLAUSE> Hillary, you probably saw yesterday, she proposed one of the biggest tax increases that anybody has ever seen. We're already the highest-taxed nation just about, but in terms of industrialized nations we're the highest-taxed nation anywhere in the world, folks. And she wants to tax us more. So we're going to be lowering your taxes very substantially. We're going to be simplifying the whole deal. You won't need H&amp;R Block anymore, believe me. You're not going to need them. <APPLAUSE> Middle-income people, the taxes are coming way down, they're coming way down. <APPLAUSE> And many people that aren't earning enough money, but they're out there really trying, they have no tax to pay. And it's going to be a very, very simplified procedure. So I want to thank everybody for being here. We're going to talk a little bit about security. I have something new with me tonight, pretty new anyway, it's like one-day old. It's called charts. Look. Charts. Charts. Do you believe it? <APPLAUSE> So we'll get into that. But I want to introduce a few people. And we have a man who has been somebody that I've known for a long time, somebody that I've respected for a long, long time. And he's your congressman, right? Do you know your congressman? You better know your congressman. So Bill Shuster is right here someplace. Come on up here, Bill. And you know, it's interesting, I'm looking about Bill, defeat ISIS with Bill, change Washington and fix the rigged system with Bill -- and me, too, by the way. I might even be more important to this than Bill, I don't know, but he's going to help. We want to secure our country. We're going to end Obamacare. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure. We're going to do all of these things. <APPLAUSE> Also, I want to introduce a woman who has been of incredible assistance to me, just incredible. The people love her. And come on up here, please. Come, come, Judy Ward, everybody. Judy? Bill, say something real quick. <APPLAUSE>
<SHUSTER: Well, thank you very much, Donald, for coming to central Pennsylvania, western Pennsylvania. (APPLAUSE) I can tell you, on election day, the state's going to be won here in central and western Pennsylvania because these people are going to get out and vote. (APPLAUSE) And the people of western and central Pennsylvania have to overcome what goes on down in Philadelphia, the cheating, what they do, we've got to make sure we're doing the job here in central Pennsylvania. The road to the White House goes through Pennsylvania, goes through central and western Pennsylvania. Ladies and gentleman, Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Bill, very much. So what Bill has been saying is a little bit -- a little bit bad because we're talking about voter ID all over the country. They're approving in some cases, in some cases they're not. And you know, I went to school in Philadelphia. I went to the Wharton School of Finance in Philadelphia, so I know the state very well. My kids went to school here, two of them, and we love -- we love the state. But we have to be very, very careful about our day because we're going to have tremendous voter turnout. We're going to have unbelievable turnout. But we don't want to see people voting five times, folks. We don't want to see it. And I've heard some stories about certain parts of the state. And we have to be very careful. I don't even know, maybe you should go down and volunteer or do something. But without voter ID, there's no way you're going to be able to check it properly. We have a lot of law enforcement people working that day. We're hiring a lot of people, we're putting a lot of law enforcement. And by the way, speaking of law enforcement, do we love our police, right? We love our police. <APPLAUSE> Just met your chief. He's like central casting. You can put him in a movie right now. But we love our police. And I will tell you that I just -- and I can't say it any more strongly, we're going to bring your jobs back, we're going to bring so much back. We're going to make our country great again. We're going to make America great again. But... <APPLAUSE> But it's a tough process because, you know, I've been talking about a rigged system for a long time. And I'll tell you, whatever you can do. I know you're going to go out, I know this part of Pennsylvania is phenomenal. I just left Erie County. Erie has been, I don't know, I guess you've heard and Bill has heard and everybody has heard what went on there. We had 10,000 -- at least 10,000 people. <APPLAUSE> And they're going to go out and vote and you're going to go out and vote. We're going to have -- I guess they call it the big T. Maybe that's lucky. Have you heard about the T? They say that T is good. I wonder what that means. But I really -- I really say, look, November 8th, such a big day, you have to turn out. We're bringing your jobs back. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton is a disaster. It's a disaster. I watched Hillary Clinton yesterday. She gave her short little speech reading a teleprompter on taxes are going to be raised. Can you believe it? She's got a massive $1.3 trillion, massive increase in taxes, massive increase in regulation. Now, speaking of regulation -- before I speak of regulation, Reince, I want to thank you. Where is Reince? What a great guy. Reince, get over here. Right, what a -- he has done -- thank you very much. Reince has done such an amazing job and they portrayed him slightly inaccurately. Reince, come here for a second, please. <APPLAUSE> The head of the Republican National Committee has done such a great job. We're friends, we work together, we work with a lot of other people. And I have to say, we have great unification. Now, every once in a while, you read about somebody that wants to be a rebel, they get a little free publicity for themselves. But the way we have gotten along. And I've raised -- I've put in a lot of money into the Republican National Committee, I've spent a lot of time and put in a lot of money. And I will tell you... <APPLAUSE> And I'm spending money on my own campaign. You know, I went through the whole primary system, I paid for it and I'm going through this. And I'm spending for me, but we're raising a lot of money for the Republicans. And honestly, I just want to thank this man because it is not an easy job. He has done an incredible job. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, man. Thank you, Reince, I appreciate it. They like to portray it a little bit differently in the press. These guys are the most dishonest people, the most. <CROWD BOOING> And I'll let you know -- hey, you know what? We have a great relationship, we have just about from the beginning. When I first came out, I'm not sure Reince believed too much. So, you know, I understand. But if I didn't have a good relationship, guess what? You and they would be the first to know. And I would call and I would tell them and I would tell you. But we've had a special relationship. But somebody has to call us, so they write stories. Like, for instance, they wrote the story about the founder, right? Barack Obama, the founder. Oh, that's sort of nice. Do we like it? Turn him off. We like him better the other way. What was that? They didn't pay their electric bill, I guess, right? <LAUGHTER> But you know, you talk about -- Barack Obama has done such a poor job with ISIS that I have been, for numerous days, sarcastically saying that he is the founder of ISIS, right? You've heard that. And then I say they really like him a lot. Don't forget, when he took over, I think there was -- there were eight countries, seven countries. Now I understand they're in 28 countries. They're rampant all over the world, probably they're rampant here, too, because we're taking in so many people we have no idea who they are. So I say -- so I've been saying and I'll keep saying because it's true, but somewhat sarcastically, I've been saying he's the founder of ISIS. And I say she's a close second. And then I say -- but they cut it off in <AUDIO GAP> media, the dishonest media, they cut that off because that, you know, shows a little sarcasm. And I say they're going to give Hillary Clinton the most improved player for letting ISIS exist. Look, if it weren't for them, you probably wouldn't even have ISIS. Of course, he calls it ISIL, ISIL. You know -- and there are reasons to call it ISIL, there actually are. Geographically, there are reasons to call it ISIL, but he's the only one. And I honestly believe he calls it ISIL to make people angry because he is the great divider. And let me tell you, folks, he is a terrible, terrible president. He has done a terrible, terrible job. He is grossly incompetent and we have to make a change. And Hillary Clinton is four more years of Obama. <CROWD BOOING> That's what she is. Four more years of ISIS, four more years of high taxes. Think of it, wants to raise your taxes. And I don't think you're going to put up with it. Four more years of -- well, I guess there won't be any e-mail scandal by that time. Can you imagine? Thirty-three thousand e-mails wiped out. Think of it, 33,000 e-mails wiped out. It's a very sad thing, folks. Well, we're going to get back to it. Listen, so I just went and I visited one of your companies, a great company, an amazing family, six generations, really seven because I actually met the seventh generation, you know what that is? You know how long? Andrew Jackson was president. Andrew Jackson, 1835. And you probably -- most of you know <inaudible> that's right. You know Mike. Everyone knows Mike. So Mike McLanahan, an amazing guy. I met his son, I met his kids, his grandkids, I met everybody, I met his employees. And they're devastated because after all of these years, from 1835 to now, they're really having a hard time because of Obama and his ridiculous policies. And George Sidney works with Mike and the family, and they said things to me that I thought were incredible. And I said, ""I know you don't do this for a living and you probably have never done this before, but if you could come up on the stage, we have a small group of about 9,000 people, if you could come up"" -- and lots of television, look at all those people. Oh, they're so terrible. They are so dishonest. <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> For instance -- for instance -- so, as you know, right downstairs and next door we have a room like this with just about as many people. They're not going to cover that. They're not going to show these massive crowds. They're not going to say that in the history of this building, which I guess is 15 years old, this is the biggest crowd they've ever had by far, by far. They're not going to say that. They're not going to say that. <APPLAUSE> So 1835. I would like to have George and Mike just come up for a minute and explain the company quickly, how it started, where they are right now and what regulations and horrible, horrible policy has done to these great people. OK, come on up. Thank you. <APPLAUSE>
<MCLANAHAN: Thank you so much. I'm Mike McLanahan, chairman of the board of McLanahan Corporation. (APPLAUSE) We started in 1835. We're 181 years old this year. The last eight years have been the toughest in existence and it's come to having to lay off friends and families that have worked for us for generation (AUDIO GAP). It's just sad. And these regulations... (AUDIO GAP) We support him in everything he's doing to change what's happening in Washington and in this country. George? (APPLAUSE)>
<SIDNEY: We're really proud of the organization that we have in McLanahan Corporation. And we wear it on our sleeve and feel it's so sad that you're talking about a company in McLanahan that's survived the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, the First World War, the Great Depression, the Second World War, the Korean conflict, the Vietnam War, the wars in the Middle East. And we're scared to death that we're not going to be able to survive four more years of Obama regulation. (APPLAUSE) Which Hillary has promised to continue his legacy. (CROWD BOOING) We're very serious when we say that we absolutely cannot sustain four more years of what we've endured over the last eight. We need help in getting Donald Trump elected. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> So Congressman Shuster, we just created two stars. And you know, it was so amazing, though. I looked and I love that stuff, I love plants, I love all of it. And I looked at the plant and you can see it's amazing, the age, but the cleanliness, the loving care that's given to the plant. I've seen plants that aren't so good. The care and the -- I looked at a piece of steel, as big a piece of steel -- I've seen big steel, but as big a piece of steel beam as I've ever seen. And I was talking to him about it. How do you get this in? How do you truck it in? What do you do? Do you splice it? What are you doing? And it was just fascinating. But I saw that, you know, so many years, so many years. And I said, so, how's business? They said it's catastrophic, it's a disaster, can't go on much longer. And I said, what's the problem? Is it regulation? Well, it's really tax and regulation. But I've found over the years, because I've met so many people, same position, incredible people. The difference here is 1835. That's a long time. That's one that's really out there. Andrew Jackson was president. You know, usually you'll hear, like, Ronald Reagan was president. That was a long time ago. But Andrew Jackson? So that was a long time ago. But when I see the love in that plant. And I met all the employees. And one of them was there 31 years. One of them there 21 years and 15 years, great people, and you know, it's just a question of time. Much smaller than it used to be, the dollar is killing them, killing them. It's not so much the dollar, it's that other countries are absolutely -- you know, what they're doing. Well, it's China and it is China, but it's others, and the devaluation of their currencies. The devaluation of their currencies is absolutely killing our companies, killing them. And we let these people get away with murder. And we're the piggy bank. Remember, they come in, they dump their product. Next is going to be steel, you watch. First of all, they're killing your coal, they're totally killing your coal, and that's one of Mike's problems also. Because the stuff they make for coal, I mean, they don't need it anymore because the mines are all being closed and the miners don't have jobs and they want to have jobs. You know, I was in West Virginia where I had a tremendous victory, I got a massive vote. And Hillary Clinton a few weeks before that, she didn't know people were listening, and she said we're going to put the mines and the miners out of business, all right? <CROWD BOOING> And then, do you remember, she went to West Virginia and she sat around the round table with that beautiful miner and his family -- that beautiful miner and his family, and in very, very sad terms he was explaining how they want to be miners, right? And she was trying to say she was only kidding, essentially. She was trying to -- yeah, she was lying. Hey, look, look, has anybody lied as much as Hillary Clinton? Has anybody? You look at the FBI director and you see what went on with the e-mails, you see how she got away with that. I think that that will go down in her career as her single greatest achievement, how she got out of that mess. But she's not out of it yet. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. Honestly, it's disgraceful. And you know who's more disgraceful, in my opinion? The media, because -- because they don't put her -- they don't put her to the task. They don't put her to the task. They don't do anything. They follow me and I'm on all the time. I do get much better ratings than her, in all fairness, though. <APPLAUSE> But the media concept is that don't put her on because if you don't watch her, she'll be OK. Right? Right? And then she goes out and she talks that she short-circuited, short-circuited -- the mind short-circuited. She was asked a question on Fox by Chris Wallace and the answer was so bad. I was watching, which is hard to watch because it's pretty boring to be honest, but she said she's short-circuited. And I said to myself, man, that's a bad one, oh, she's going to have problems. Wait until you see tomorrow. Nothing. What do you see the next day? Nothing. And I said to a friend of mine, can you imagine if I said that about myself? I would be all over every paper anywhere in the world, right? It's like I told you about, you know, sarcastically -- I mean, you ought to see these news organizations yesterday when I said Obama, right? Did you see that? That Obama is the founder of ISIS, he's the MVP, they're going to be giving him the MVP award and she's right there next to him. And you had to see. And they left the MVP stuff out because then you'd know. But you had to hear, did he mean it? What does it mean? We have nine panelists tonight... <LAUGHTER> We have one -- we have one panelist representing Donald Trump, we have eight panelists plus the moderator and plus another few moderators. Come on, folks, get in here. It is so ridiculous what's going on, the pile-on. A man that's been doing this for 45 years said it's the single- greatest pile-on of a candidate that he's ever seen. Every day, every single day, story after story after story. And I think they're going to be good stories. You know, I do good work. I've built one of the great companies of this country. I built this -- I did one of the great jobs, some of the great assets in the world. Very low debt, tremendous cash flow, that's why I can do this stuff, believe me. <APPLAUSE> You think it's cheap? It's not cheap. And by the way, in the primaries, I spent about $51 million, something like that, and -- which believe it or not was about the lowest amount of money for the majors, right? And I came in first in a landslide. Others spent much more than that, one spent many times more than that and came in toward the bottom of the pack. And I said to myself, isn't that what you want for a president, right? Don't you want -- you spend the least and you come in first. <APPLAUSE> Spend the least and come in first, wouldn't that be nice? And that's what we have to do. That's what we have to do. But Hillary Clinton will be so bad for our country, will be so bad for our country. And here's the thing, the press doesn't go after her. So she hasn't had a news conference in approximately -- in fact, her statement and a couple of other bad statements were made -- oh, don't worry about it. Go home. Go home. Like, go home.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> So she's going home to mommy. Go home to mommy. <APPLAUSE> Go home. Go home. And you know the nice part? Her mother is voting for Donald Trump. It's great. <APPLAUSE> So it's an amazing thing that's happening. But they don't show her. So she hasn't had a news conference in, what, 255 days, something like that. The little one that she had, she tried to pretend. They were all her friends and they were asking -- and she gave such bad answers. But I just said, man, look at these answers. Wow. I don't want anybody to be hurt, but I said she's really going to be hurt by those answers. And what happened? Nothing. Although now, I will tell you, it was a little delayed reflex, but short-circuit really is catching on now very belatedly, because we don't want a president that's going to short-circuit. We have bigger problems than that. We have big problems in this country, we don't need that. So she wants to raise your taxes; I'm going to lower your taxes. She wants to raise your regulations, and you heard Mike and George talking about regulations, they're putting them out of business. And we're going to do such a massive decrease of regulation so that our small businesses can thrive and grow and start. Can't even start a small business. <APPLAUSE> So we have -- we have lots of things that we're going to be working on. But I'll tell you, big is we're going to bring our companies back, big. And for this area, honestly, we've got to bring our companies back. Our companies have gone to Mexico. I tell it now, for the last month I tell this. This is so inexpensive, because normally, you'd go out, you'd hire a big firm or you'd hire the Harvard guys or the Wharton guys and they'd charge you a lot of money, they do a report and they come back in six months, they'd charge you a million dollars. And you wouldn't know anything. Most of the reports you'd just take them and throw them. But a friend of mine builds plants, right? And he's just about the biggest in the world, maybe he is the biggest in the world, but he builds massive plants. And I said to him, how are you doing? He said really well. I said, where? He said, ""Donald, you have to see what we're doing in Mexico. We are building some of the great plants anywhere in the world, car plants, computer plants, anything."" I said, really? He said it's the eighth wonder of the world, Mexico. And he wants to build here. He's an American guy, he's a U.S. guy, he wants to build here. So I said, how's the United States doing? He goes just like this, meh. How stupid are we? How stupid are we to allow this? Our companies are moving to Mexico. As we talk today, and I said this before in Erie because we had a crowd that was massive in Erie -- and somebody said it's, like, a Democrat area. I don't think so, I'll tell you I don't think so. We had this massive crowd of people. But I said it to them. We can't let our companies go without consequence. We can't let our companies be stripped out of our country, open up a plant somewhere because of a NAFTA agreement that was signed by Bill Clinton, with a wife that won't be -- she won't be able to do a damn thing about it. <APPLAUSE> There have to be consequences when they leave and they fire all their people. And the consequences when they make their product and they want to sell it through what will soon be a very, very strong, powerful border, they're going to pay a 35 percent tax on that product. And they're not going to leave, they won't leave. <APPLAUSE> Don't worry about it, folks. They won't be leaving. They won't be leaving. So in this area, because it's been hit so hard and the coal has been hit so hard -- you know, in Erie they have General Electric and they're stopping with the big locomotives. It's way down because the coal is way down. It's way, way down, tremendous unemployment. Well, all of that's going to stop. So we're going to open our minds, we're going to work with our steelworkers and our miners and all of our people. <APPLAUSE> And you know, look, my whole theme of what we're doing is very simple. He's got it on his cap. There are hundreds of people that have it on their caps. It's called make America great again. America first, make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Now, believe me, the jobs are coming back, folks. That's going to be so easy. A friend of mine said, why didn't somebody else think of that? And honestly, they don't think of it because they're politicians. And other than Bill, who would understand that immediately, right? Bill has no doubt, and Judy, and he is, Bill is a business guy. But these are politicians that, number one, are controlled by special interests and lobbyists, right, and donors. And a lot of times they don't want it because they own companies that want to move across the border, there are a lot of reasons. A friend of mine recently said, Donald, how could a certain deal have been made a month ago? He said it doesn't make sense, it's so bad for the country. He said, boy, those politicians are stupid. I said, no, they're not stupid. They're getting massive campaign contributions. They're getting massive donations. Isn't it nice that I do what I do and I just spend a lot of money? I'll tell you, I hope I win. I'm going to feel very, very foolish if I don't win. But when they call me because they need help in moving their company out of the United States and firing a lot of people, folks, I couldn't care less. They didn't give me anything, I couldn't care less. We're going to keep our companies and we're going to bring new jobs back in. And they're going to come roaring back in with a new tax on business. They're going to come roaring back in. And they're coming in to this area. And we're going to cut regulations and our favorite, unbelievably old company is going to thrive again, hopefully better than it's ever been since Andrew Jackson. OK? <APPLAUSE> So one of the things that we have to do, and there's so many, one of the things we have to do, Supreme Court justices, right? The new president is going to have probably -- next president, probably more picks of Supreme Court justices. We lost a great one with Judge Scalia, lost a great one, we lost a great one, a great guy. I met him a couple of times, what a great, great guy, very conservative principles, very smart. And he wasn't -- and that wasn't supposed to happen, that was supposed to be another 10 years, 15 years. So we have one before we start. We could have four, we could even have five; probably we'll have three. But when I watch these people, never Trump, those poor, poor, sad people. They've been saying never Trump now for two years. Never Trump, never Trump. Trump gets more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party, and then never Trump, never Trump, never Trump. <APPLAUSE> I don't get it. I don't get it. Never Trump. I mean, we won massive numbers of states, far more than -- there wasn't even a second-place finisher, frankly. So we won these massive numbers of states. We won almost 14 million votes, and that's with 17 people, don't forget. When Ronald Reagan ran -- great guy, by the way -- when Ronald Reagan ran and when others that did well ran, they're running against two and three people and four people. I ran against 17 people and got more votes. Think of what that means. We got more votes than anybody. We brought in new votes into the Republican Party. That's all not being registered in different forms of media. They're not talking about the fact that the Republican primaries were up 60 percent and the Democrats were down 20 percent. So with all the Bernie stuff -- and we like Bernie. Look, Bernie, the system was rigged. And we're going to watch Pennsylvania very quickly. We're going to watch Pennsylvania. Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don't come in and vote five times. Because if you do that -- and I know you're all voting. Is everybody here voting? <APPLAUSE> If you do that, if you do that, we're not going to lose. The only way we could lose, in my opinion, I really mean this, Pennsylvania is if cheating goes on, I really believe it. Because I looked at Erie and it was the same thing as this. And I've been all over the state and I know the state well, I know the state well. But let me just tell you, I looked all over Pennsylvania and I'm studying it. And we have some great people here, some great leaders here of the Republican Party and they're very concerned about that. And that's the way we can lose the state. And we have to call up law enforcement and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching because if we get cheated out of this election, if we get cheated out of a win in Pennsylvania, which is such a vital state, especially when I know what's happening here, folks, I know. She can't beat what's happening here. The only way they can beat it, in my opinion, and I mean this 100 percent, if in certain sections of the state they cheat. OK? So I hope you people can sort of not just vote on the 8th, go around and look and watch other polling places and make sure that it's a hundred percent fine. Because without voter identification, which is shocking, shocking that you don't have it -- many states it gets approved and some states they don't get approved. And I have still -- I'm supposed to be a smart person -- I have still -- I have yet to understand how you cannot approve voter identification, at least in some form, right? So we're going to do things that are going to be amazing, I really believe, on November 8th. We're doing well in Florida, we're doing well in Ohio. I think we're going to do well in Virginia -- we're not doing as well there now, but I actually think we're doing really well, I just don't think they're giving us the credit. We're still pretty close. But we're doing really well in certain states that no other Republican would even waste their time with. We're doing well in lots of different -- we're doing well in Michigan. Hey, look, I've been talking about Michigan being ripped off with their car companies moving to Mexico, for two years, OK? They don't talk. Hillary doesn't know about it. Hillary, aye, aye, aye <ph>. <LAUGHTER> Four more years of Obama, but worse, and run by the machine and total dishonesty, total dishonesty. I mean, again, look at the e- mails. Remember, 33,000 e-mails, 33,000 e-mails and it's OK, it's all right. Don't forget. Well, maybe it is OK. No, it probably is. 33,000 -- she needed a few for the wedding and she needed some for yoga class, right? So I figure two for yoga class, five for the wedding, where are the rest? Boy, oh, boy, would I like to see. Hey, can you imagine what's on those e-mails? Now, they say that NSA has those e-mails. You know that, right? They say they have them. They say NSA has everybody's e-mails, but they say that NSA has the e-mails. So if they have the e-mails, if they have the e-mails, I think maybe should they give them out? I don't know -- I don't know, I don't know what the law is. But they say that they would have the e-mails. I guess somebody came out from NSA and they said we have everybody's e-mails. So I don't think they tried too hard. Do you, folks? I don't think they tried. We'll see what happens. The other thing we need, we need security at our border. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500 Border Patrol agents endorse Donald Trump -- sure of <inaudible> the first time they've ever done this in a presidential race, 16,500. And believe me, if they didn't, their job is a lot easier, just walk right by, go ahead. The other way they have to stop them, bring them back, it's a lot more work. They're great people. But 16,500 endorsed me. Sheriff Joe Arpaio from Arizona, like, a great man. He's been on the borders for 50 years. I can't imagine. And he's tough and he's smart and he's strong and he's a good person. I'll tell you -- I've gotten to know him -- thank you -- I've gotten to know him very well. He's a good person. But he knows what's good and he knows what's fair and he endorsed me and that was a great honor. OK? And a lot of other people. By the way, a lot of other people, but on the border. <APPLAUSE> So here's the story. So many people when I walked in, would you read The Snake tonight? I don't know, have you heard The Snake, anybody? Has anybody heard it? Raise your hand if you've heard it. Not that many, it's great. Is it OK for the ones that have heard it if I read it? Is that OK? Written by the great Al Wilson years ago. So we need a strong border because drugs are pouring across, crime is pouring across. It's rampant, rampant. And when I originally ran, when I made my first statement, I talked about illegal immigration. I talked about problems that we have. It turned out to be true -- it turned out to be true. So we have problems where our military is depleted; we have to rebuild it. We have problems where our vets aren't being taken care of; we have to take care of our vets. <APPLAUSE> We have massive problems with education, and we have to end Common Core, and we have to bring education local. <APPLAUSE> We have to repeal and replace Obamacare, we have to do it. <APPLAUSE> We have to save our Second Amendment. <APPLAUSE> The NRA, by the way, endorsed me early. I think it was the earliest endorsement they've ever given. But the NRA endorsed me, terrific people. They love this country, let me tell you. They love this country. <APPLAUSE> And you know, it's interesting. San Bernardino, they walk in, boom, boom, boom, Paris, Orlando, so many places. Now, Paris actually has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world. You don't have guns, unless you're a bad guy you have guns because then you're allowed to walk in with guns. Right? But you obey the law, they don't have guns. Toughest gun laws they say in the world, who knows? So these thugs, these horrible, horrible -- I was going to say human beings, but I would say these horrible animals walk in to various places, all fairly close together, and they just start, boom, boom, boom, you get over here, boom, boom, boom, 130 killed. Many, many, hundreds, people don't know this, hundreds in the hospitals never really to recover. I mean, some are so badly wounded. Same thing, San Bernardino, 14 people killed, many, many people still in the hospital. I mean, their lives can never be the same. And I'm just saying, if we had people in that room, if we had some people in any of those rooms with a gun right around here... <APPLAUSE> ... where when they see it's going to happen, the bullets start flying in the opposite direction. <APPLAUSE> You really would have had a whole different story. And you know, if they knew that you had guns where the bullets are going to go in the opposite direction, they'd probably say let's take a pass, OK, let's not even go in. So we're allowing -- we're allowing -- tremendous numbers of people into our country from Syria, from parts of the massive terrorist world. We have no idea who they are. Law enforcement says there's no way really to vet them. There's no real paperwork, there's a lot of false paperwork. And we're allowing -- and Hillary Clinton wants to allow <AUDIO GAP> 550 percent more coming in than Obama. <CROWD BOOING> So I read this today and so many people standing outside they heard me, they said, would you do it again? I said I'll do it again. And it's called The Snake. And it represents, in my mind, what's going to happen in our country. Because this is like the Trojan horse, we're allowing people in. And I have a bigger heart, I have a big heart, I want to take care of people. I want to build safe zones in Syria, I want to have the Gulf states pay for it. We don't have -- hey, we're at $20 trillion, OK, folks? It's time we stop. We've spent probably $4 to $5 trillion in the Middle East. You know what we have? Nothing, nothing. If we would have done nothing in the Middle East, we would have been unbelievable. So we've spent all of this money in the Middle East, we have nothing for it. So here's the story. I read this, I immediately thought of our border, OK, immediately. And I said to myself, guess what, I'm going to put this in the form of a poem and I'm going to read it when I'm of that mind. Because you see what's happening, you see what's happening in Germany, you see what's happening in France. Look at France, look at what's going on in France with Nice, with all of the things going on in France. I have friends that won't go there anymore. I have a friend, he thinks Paris, the city of lights, he thinks it's the most beautiful city. I said, how are you doing, did you go to Paris yet this year? I don't go to Paris anymore, France is no longer France. How stupid are we? How stupid are we? When you see what's going on, how stupid are we? So we're letting these people in, right? This is a tremendous mistake. Look at what one person did, one sicko, wacko whose father was sitting behind Hillary Rodham Clinton with a big, red hat on and a big smile on his face. You see that? Was that a smile? He's sitting behind her. And as soon as I saw that and I heard he was there because he came over, we think it's him, and he had a red hat, I said, oh, no, don't tell me, but it wasn't. It was not make America great again hat. But you see this guy sitting back there. And his son had just killed so many people in Orlando. And here's the story, so I read this, and a lot of people love it. And think of it as what happens if we're not smart, tough and vigilant with our borders, with people coming in that we don't know about them, that we don't know who they are, where they come from, especially when you have a track record of violence all over the world. What the hell do we need it for? We'll build safe havens. But what the -- what are we doing? So are you ready, folks? <APPLAUSE> Called The Snake. On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tenderhearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake. His pretty-colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. Oh well, she cried, I'll take you in and I'll take care of you. Take me in, oh, tender woman, take me in, for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman, sighed the broken snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk, then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now, she hurried home from work that night, as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken had been totally revived. Take me in, oh, tender woman, take me in, for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman, sighed the broken snake. Now, she clutched him to her bosom, you're so beautiful, she cried. But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you certainly might have died. Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in, oh, tender woman, take me in, for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. I saved you, cried that woman, and you've bit me, heavens, why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die. Oh, shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in. <APPLAUSE> Be careful, folks. Be careful, Altoona. People put all over the country, we don't even know where the hell they're being put. You know that, right? Your government officials don't even know, many of them, don't even know. Your governors don't know, your senators don't know, you don't even know. This could be the great Trojan horse. This could replace the story of the Trojan horse, OK? So I brought something special for you. We're going to go quickly because I want to get the hell out of here, I want to go home. <LAUGHTER> But I'm only leaving if you promise -- if you promise -- than on November 8th you're going to vote for Trump and we're going to make America great again. <APPLAUSE> All right. You ready? All right. Congratulations, Pennsylvania. Great job, great job. Great job, Governor Ridge. Great job. The Clinton's legacy: One in three manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania has been lost since NAFTA. Would you say that's something to be proud of? I don't think so. One in three lost since NAFTA. Not too good, right? I love these boards. Look, here's a beauty -- here's a beauty. I just -- I love charts, I love charts. And they always said, you know, it's too tough putting a screen up, you've got to get guys, it costs too much money -- I don't like to spend money. This is a cheap version of a screen, OK? It's just as good, but you need good, strong hands. So, look, you ready? So there it is. So U.S. home ownership, right? Lowest in 51 years, right? So the American dream, folks, the American dream, there it is, the American dream. Here's Obama, here's where we are right now. Home ownership, the American dream is to have a house, to own a house. Here's where we are right now, folks. Wow, wow. Great -- great job -- great job, Obama. All right, here's the snake. The snake, do we like the snake? No I don't like the snake. So Syrian refugees admitted to the United States, monthly totals since October of 2015. Look, look, how stupid are we, folks? How stupid are we, folks? <CROWD BOOING> Look at that. And Hillary Clinton, again, wants 550 percent more. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. You better get out there and vote. Here's another beauty. Number one, ready? Number and percent of immigrants in the United States 1900 to 2010, plus Census Bureau projections. Look at this, OK? Go ahead, go ahead. A lot of them coming in from Syria, from places that are rough places, OK, rough places. OK. So here's something. So I spent a lot of money on my campaign, I continue to spend a lot of money on my campaign, that's good. And I'm not looking -- you know, I'm raising a lot of money for Reince and for the whole Republican Party. A lot of people don't understand that, but that's OK. But I've raised a lot of money. We took in $51 million in June, we took in 82, I think, million dollars last month. <APPLAUSE> And I don't think they even know I'm doing -- I'll be honest. Some of these people, they're saying, like, well, we don't know if we like Donald Trump. I'm raising so much money for these people. Oh, but that's OK. They'll figure it out soon. I'm telling you, soon they're going to figure it out. And the other ones, you know, when you hear never Trump. How about never Trump? Think of this -- think of this, never Trump, never Trump. I told you, we got the highest vote in history, but never Trump. Supreme Court justice -- so it's not me, it's going to be Hillary. If it's Hillary, you're going to have super-left-leaning judges. You're going to have a country that's destroyed probably forever. It would be 75 years, but probably forever, OK? How could they not say Trump? But they defeated and they were defeated. They've been saying for so long never Trump, years, never Trump, and they're embarrassed. So we understand. But you know what? It doesn't matter. Because if we win, it doesn't make any difference. But I'll tell you what, I'm going to say never them, never... <APPLAUSE> So, you see what I did here? Look. So in one way, I feel a little foolish, to be honest. I showed this yesterday. I feel a little bit foolish. Hillary, Hillary -- these are hedge funders. Now, I know the hedge funders, many of them. Some are semi-friends of mine, some are sort of friends of mine, tough guys, tough people, tough women in a couple of cases, not too many, but tough, tough people, smart. And they give her millions and millions of dollars. They're not doing that for their health. They're not doing that for the good of the country, folks. This I can tell you. These are tough people. Frankly, they're people that I'd like negotiating for, let's say, against China. You know, we have all of these political hacks negotiating our deals. But I have some, like Carl Icahn, I have some of the great people on my side, some of the greatest businessmen in the world, and they love it because they want great trade deals and we're going to renegotiate our trade deals. And Hillary Clinton said, after hearing me yesterday, we are going to renegotiate, the other day, we are going to renegotiate our trade deals. She never even thought of it before. And she can't do it because her donors won't allow her to do it, folks, a hundred percent. Do I know this business, or what? Hey, I used to be a donor, now I'm a donor to myself for my own campaign. <APPLAUSE> And you think it's easy? It takes guts to run for president, don't kid yourself. <APPLAUSE> So look at this one. So this is a campaign contributions from hedge funders, these are the tough ones, hedge fund guys, hedge fund people. Hillary Clinton, crooked Hillary, $48,500,000; Trump, $19,000. I don't even know who it is. <LAUGHTER> And look, they had a terrible picture of Hillary, which I felt was unfair. I said don't do that, get the best picture you can find. And I'll tell you what, honestly, I feel much better about it. No, they had this terrible picture, it was unfair. I'm a very fair person. $48,500,000 against $19,000 -- I'm going to give the $19,000 back, it's ridiculous. I don't know who the... <APPLAUSE> This is just a list of some of the countries, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Algeria, Qatar. These are millions of dollars given to Hillary Clinton. You think she maybe will do what they want her to do? So here's your total national debt, total national debt, it's doubled under Obama, will more than double by the time he gets out. And you know the bad thing -- I was thinking about it today. Yes, it's tough, but we'll be at $20 trillion. Nobody even knows what that is. We're going to be at $20 trillion. But here's the thing. If it doubled, Bill, as an example, if it doubled and our roads were in great shape and our schools and our hospitals and everything was good, right, if our bridges and tunnels were beautiful and new and fresh -- 50 percent of our bridges are in trouble, our tunnels are a mess. You ever go through these tunnels? The tiles are falling off the roof, right? You know, as a builder it's disgusting to me. You go through these tunnels and you say, I wonder, were people injured? You see tiles. You know, they used to be beautiful, white tiles, right? And now you'll see big openings where patches have fallen off. I say, there are cars driving 40, 50 miles an hour through. I mean, if those tiles fall and the people get killed, right? Now, I don't know, I don't read about it. But you look at our tunnels, they're disgusting, they're dirty, there's soot, the tiles are all off. The roads are in bad shape. So if you had $20 trillion and everything was tippy-top -- I like tippy-top. Everyone who goes to my buildings and my clubs, they're tippy-top, right? Tippy-top. We're opening up a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue over a year ahead of schedule and way under budget, and it's the best. And it's better than we projected. It's going to be one of the great hotels of the world. <APPLAUSE> Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. So the way I look at it, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue one way or the other, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care. <APPLAUSE> One way or the other. But that hotel is under budget and ahead of schedule by more than a year. Wouldn't it be nice? You know, I was recently traveling to -- I won't mention the location because they're incredible people -- but I was in an area where they have a hospital, a veterans' hospital that's under construction. I said, how's it doing? Oh, Mr. Trump, sir, it's a disaster. Why is it a disaster? It's not that big, why is it a disaster? Well, we have a $1.2 billion -- billion -- cost overrun. I said, a billion dollars? How can you have a billion, how can you have $1.2 billion? Do you think those contractors and those subcontractors are making a couple of bucks on that, folks? How stupid are we to let this happen? How stupid are we? $1.2 billion for a hospital. That should be a tiny fraction of that to build it, to build it. So here's the story, folks. We have to get out on November 8th. I'm going to come back. I'm going to be in Pennsylvania a lot. I'll come back again and visit you. <APPLAUSE> But you've got to get out and vote. You've got to get out and vote. And I promise you we're going to do such a great job, you're going to be so proud of your country. You're going to be so proud -- less importantly, but you're going to be so proud of your president. I'm a messenger. I'm a messenger for common sense. I'm a messenger for doing what we all know has to be done. But we don't win anymore, but we're going to start winning again. We're going to win with our military, which I said before is very, very depleted. But we're going to build it up and we're going to make it strong and we're going to make it powerful. And hopefully, we're not going to use it other than to knock the hell out of ISIS. We have no choice. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to take care of our vets, our great vets. And they have not been taken care of. And we're going to have strong borders, and by the way, we're going to build the wall and we're going to stop drugs from coming in. <APPLAUSE> And Mexico is going to pay for the wall. And we're going to save our Second Amendment. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to make the greatest trade deals we've ever made. Jobs are going to come flowing back. We're not going to let our companies go. We're going to be the smart people. And we're going to win and win and win, and we're going to win so much that the people in this room are going to call up their congressmen and say, congressmen, we cannot stand it, our president is winning too much, we're not used to it. Please, please, Mr. Congressman, please go see the president and talk to him. And I'm going to say, when he comes into Washington, Bill, I'm sorry, I can't do that. Actually, I want to win much more. We're going to win so much. We're going to win at every single level. We're going to make America first, and we're going to make America great again. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. <APPLAUSE> ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-17"">
<HANNITY: Welcome to Hannity. And we are at the Pabst Theater. Welcome Milwaukee, Wisconsin. How are you? Here tonight for the entire hour Donald Trump is going to talk about the threat of radical Islam and what poses and how we can ultimately defeat it. And tonight you'll also hear from victims of terror attacks and (ph) family members and the author of ""Defeating Jihad"" Dr. Sebastian Gorka. We have a huge, fun enthusiastic audience. The governor of the great state is here. Sheriff Clarke is here tonight. But before we get started - on a serious note, this summer we have seen a wave of violence inspired by radical Islamists both here at home and abroad. Let's get a quick reminder. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO)>
<UNKNOWN: Oh my god. They're all shooting back at (INAUDIBLE).>
<UNKNOWN: Tonight our community witnessed or experienced a very horrific crime. Many lives were lost.>
<UNKNOWN: Now a terrorist outside Paris stabbing and killing two French police officers and he streamed the murders live on Facebook.>
<UNKNOWN: One of the three blew himself up outside. The other two blew themselves up inside after opening fire and engaging in a firefight with police. That all too familiar news of another terror attack striking at the very heart of Europe. Suddenly, this truck accelerated and plowed into the people lying on a beach watching the fireworks.>
<UNKNOWN: There is no (INAUDIBLE). This is the reality. The enemy has a plan. The enemy is dedicated.>
<UNKNOWN: An Afghan refugee injured five people in an ax attack in Meersburg. Another Syrian refugee killed a co-worker and injured two others in a knife attack in the town of Reutlingen.>
<UNKNOWN: A Syrian suicide bomber who pledged his allegiance to ISIS blowing himself up and injuring 15 people.>
<UNKNOWN: They attacked and cut the throat of the priest, and then attacked one of the elderly parishioners. They then left the church and it was as they were emerging from the church that they called, ""Allahu Akbar!"" >
<SEAN HANNITY: And joining us now here in Milwaukee, 2016 Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump is with us. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: You know, I which had very closely your speech yesterday and you were very, very frank and you talked about this being literally -- this death -- ideology of death must be stopped. You talked about San Bernardino. You talked about Orlando. You talked about Chattanooga. You talked about Paris, uh, France, Germany, Belgium, all of this terror. That's just from this summer. Is this a war, a clash of civilizations?>
<TRUMP:> Absolutely it is. And we're not taking it, uh, we're not taking it to them and we have to take it to them. You know, I didn't want to go into Iraq, I said, now he's a civilian, so I would say not too many people cared what I wanted to do. But that was a terrible mistake. Our terrible mistake number two was getting out the way we got out. President Obama, Hillary Clinton, the way they got out was absolutely insane. It will be talked about for many, many years and it really led to the formation of ISIS. Uh, we have problems in this country. We're letting thousands and thousands of people come into our country. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no paperwork. Nobody knows what they're doing. And they're coming in by the thousands. And Hillary Clinton, it was announced recently that she wants to allow 550 percent more coming into our country from Syria, from the migration than Obama is allowing to come in.
<HANNITY: You said yesterday...>
<TRUMP:> So it's got...
<HANNITY: -- anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead this country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, the oppression, the violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president. (INAUDIBLE)...>
<TRUMP:> Well, he actually had a speech. And it's -- it's so <INAUDIBLE>... <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> It's actually... <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> -- it's not only true, it's sad because, I mean, how obvious can it be? You look at what's going on, World Trade Center, you look at San Bernardino, you look at so many different things. You look at Nice just recently. I have friends, they won't go to France anymore. They love France. They love the -- the city of lights, Paris. They love -- they love Paris. And I say to them, how was France this summer? Oh, we don't go there anymore. France is no longer France. And we're going to do the same thing to our country, Sean. So we can't allow it to happen and I have as big a heart as anybody. We take care of people. We'll build safe zones over in Syria. We'll do something. We have to have the Gulf states pay for it, because the Gulf states they make nothing but money...
<HANNITY: In other words, the refugees, you'll help them.>
<TRUMP:> A hundred percent.
<HANNITY: You'll give food, water, medicine...>
<TRUMP:> Oh, 100 percent.
<HANNITY: -- supplies, baby formula, but it will be a safe zone that's protected and not bring them here.>
<TRUMP:> A hundred percent. A hundred percent. And we have to... <APPLAUSE>
<HANNITY: Let me ask you this. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: I know it was... (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: -- it was deemed controversial when you said that the founder of ISIS is Obama and the co-founder is Hillary. Um, but yesterday... (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: -- yesterday... (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: -- yesterday, you went into a lot of detail. You did -- you and I actually -- I remember debating you because I did support Iraq, but I didn't support leaving early without finishing the job. We had so many Americans bleed and die and risk their lives for Mosul, Baghdad, Fallujah, Ramadi, and -- and Tikrit. They won those cities.>
<TRUMP:> Right. 
<HANNITY: And you talked about even though you were opposed to it, you were opposed to leaving...>
<TRUMP:> Well, look -- look, I said one thing right from the beginning, I wanted to get out. We should have never been there and I wanted to get out and I've been -- I've been against it ever since. I mean you can look back to 2004, 2003, uh, in fact, on Neil Cavuto's show, before the war started, I said, let's not do it. We have other things we have to do, including fix our economy, which was a mess, OK, to put it mildly. But the way we got out was ridiculous. But I've been saying something ever since I've known you, keep the oil. Have I said that?
<HANNITY: Yes.>
<TRUMP:> Keep the oil. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Keep the oil. And...
<TRUMP:> We went through -- and I said, when we went in, you know, in the old days, to the victor belonged the spoils. We -- if we -- I don't call it a victory, it's no victory. But certainly militarily, we wiped them out. But I said keep the oil and take the money and some of it give to the families of the soldiers who died. Give it to the Wounded Warriors. Give to the people that have been hurt so badly in that war. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And -- and it... <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> -- it -- it would be -- by the way, that would be such a small part of the money and the rest we used to pay ourselves... <CROSSTALK>
<HANNITY: -- lifeblood of how they fight terror now.>
<TRUMP:> Right. So...
<HANNITY: That's how they're funding it.>
<TRUMP:> -- it's -- what I'm saying is keep the oil. Now, if they would have done that, there would be no ISIS. I said keep the oil. And I -- I think most of the audience has heard me say 200 times, I mean every time practically somebody or so <ph>. So I wanted to get out, but I wanted to keep the oil. So by nature, that means you're staying in because you're going to have to guard the oil, etc. Etc. But that oil is very prized oil, believe me. We have the same problem in Libya right now. We did the stupid attacks on Libya and we got nothing out of it and ISIS has taken over the oil and it's some of the finest oil in the world.
<HANNITY: You said it's time for a new approach yesterday. But you're also against sending in ground troops. And this enemy is different from any other enemy. And you mentioned our history of defeating fascism and Nazism and communism and imperial Japan. And you talk all about that. How do you defeat ISIS if you don't have ground troops?>
<TRUMP:> So when I was young and went to school, I had always heard we never lost, this country, we never lost a war, you know, World War I, World War II, we -- we just didn't lose wars. And since then, I mean when you think of it, you look at Vietnam, you look at this mess that we're in right now, all of the money spent on this. I mean it's so sad. Trillions of dollars. I used to say $2 trillion in Iraq. But that was years ago. I mean I've been saying that for so long. Nobody even knows what it is. In the meantime, our country is going to hell. Our infrastructure is terrible. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals, they're -- we're like a Third World -- we're becoming like a Third World country. We're spending our money over there. With all of that being said, you have an enemy that wants to do serious harm to us, OK, beyond what anyone has ever seen. This is like medieval times.
<HANNITY: You know, you know what other like one question I'd like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama asked. I've seen the beheading videos. Have any of you taken the time? It is -- it is the embodiment of evil in our time. I don't know if Hillary or Obama has ever watched them. Have you watched those videos?>
<TRUMP:> I -- I chose not to, but, you know, I -- we all understood what took place and these were great young people. And not only our people, they're doing it to their own people. They're doing it to Christians. If you're a Christian in the Middle East and they have you, it's very likely that's going to happen. The point is, they want to do serious harm. We have to take them out. We have to take them out very, very swiftly and viciously if necessary. <APPLAUSE> 
<HANNITY: If there's no ground troops, though, you know, (INAUDIBLE) a couple of other things. You said the era of nation-building is over and it's going to come to a quick end. And you're saying it will come to a quick end. That will mean bombing on a very -- at a very high level. And every time that happens, you know what the media is going to do, is they're going to find the one area where there is collateral damage, which sadly happens in every war. We've been a compassionate nation. How do you do it...>
<TRUMP:> Generals have... <CROSSTALK>
<HANNITY: -- collateral damage and win?>
<TRUMP:> Right. General Flynn and other of the generals, these are great people. And I ask them all the time, if you were given your head <ph>, because right now, they're fighting a politically correct war. If you were given your head, just you go and you've got to get them out, how long would it take? I'll tell you what, they are... <CROSSTALK>
<TRUMP:> -- they are telling me they could do the job very, very rapidly. Now, very rapidly is longer than you would like, but they could get the job done and get it done with precision and get it done. Uh, we have no choice, Sean. We have no choice. We have to take them out.
<HANNITY: All right, stay right there. We're just getting things started. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: Now, we will have much more as we continue with Donald Trump right after the break. Also tonight, you'll meet victims of radical Islamic terror attacks, their family members, as we continue, HANNITY from Milwaukee and The Pabst Theater, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)>
<UNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE). He was there on the floor. >
<UNKNOWN: She says I saw two sisters and one brother from Poland who were mourning the death of their two other siblings. The youngest was crying and the other just didn't know how to react.>
<UNKNOWN: It took a priest to really -- to touch the very deep identity of the French people and that's why it -- it was really a very (INAUDIBLE).>
<UNKNOWN: I feel guilty about screaming about my legs in pain, because I could feel nothing. Like the other 49 who weren't so lucky to feel this pain of mine. The guilt of being alive is heavy. (END VIDEO CLIP)>
<HANNITY: Just a few of the victims of terror. We continue from Milwaukee for the full hour with Donald Trump, as we talk about protecting the homeland. And joining us now, we have victims of terror to tell their story. Joining us here, Karen McWatters. Her husband, Kevin, and Karen, you lost your leg in the bombing.>
<MCWATTERS: I did.>
<HANNITY: Tell us your story.>
<MCWATTERS: I went to see my husband Kevin run and we got a nice spot right at the finish line. I was with a dear friend, Crystal (ph). And, uh, we were all having a great time. The marathon is always a fun day and lots of celebration and fun. And we were at the site of the first bombing. So when the first bomb went off, um, we -- that's -- you know, when -- when I lost my leg and actually, it wasn't right away, but I hurt my leg and Crystal died there. And then we were awake to hear the second bombing. And then after that (INAUDIBLE).>
<HANNITY: This was your close friend?>
<MCWATTERS: She was a close friend, yes.>
<HANNITY: What do you think when you hear -- you heard Mr. Trump's speech yesterday -- you hear a president that can't say radical Islamic terror?>
<MCWATTERS: It's really upsetting. I don't think it's helpful. I think if we don't speak honestly and, um, clearly about what's happening that we can't solve the issue. And I think, um, that he is so concerned that Muslims are all going to be targeted or -- or some -- I -- I'm assuming he thinks that, but for -- I lost my leg. I don't blame all Muslims because I lost my leg. I understand the difference between radicalized, um, people and people who are of peace.>
<HANNITY: Now, Donald Trump, who's sitting right here, talked yesterday about extreme vetting of people that come from countries that practice Sharia, which is the antithesis of our own constitution. Is that something that you think this country -- I mean would you like -- what would you like to tell her?>
<TRUMP:> Well, we're just allowing people into our country that some are going to be a problem. And we have enough problems in our country right now and you people are really proof positive. What you've gone through, it's unimaginable. I watched the Boston bombing so many times on television, how somebody can do that, how they got them on tape. It was genius police work, how they got them to start off with, but, you know, how they caught him. But when you walk -- you see them walking along like they haven't got a problem in the world. And they're looking to do mass destruction. And when I see that, I want to do something about it. I want to do something about it. <APPLAUSE>
<HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE)... (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: -- her two... (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: -- this guy, who's a very close friend now, of mine and -- and she's become a close friend. This is Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: He is one of the heroes of Benghazi. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE) husband (INAUDIBLE) was -- was also one of the heroes, you remember, Mr. Trump...>
<TRUMP:> Sure.
<HANNITY: -- that they were given a stand down order.>
<TRUMP:> Sure.
<HANNITY: They all risked their careers and they said we're not standing down when Americans are under fire. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: While Hillary Clinton was debating... (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: -- whether to ask the Libyan government permission and whether or not they could go in uniform... (CROSSTALK)>
<HANNITY: -- you lost your husband that day. And your husband went to protect people that he knew were under assault at -- at that compound. And he will tell you, and others that I have interviewed, that your husband saved a lot of people's lives. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: Yes. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: That's really I -- I'm here this evening because... (CROSSTALK)>
<UNKNOWN: -- of, uh, Benghazi. And I, you know, as a victim, um, there was lack -- under -- under Hillary Clinton in the State Department, there was a lack of security planning and decision-making up to and during that night. The Obama administration lacked strategic action because they felt like there wasn't enough time to help them. You know, Americans died. My husband died saving American lives. We're at war against Islamic, you know, radical Islam...>
<HANNITY: Yes.>
<UNKNOWN: -- um, here and abroad. So, you know, we have men and women out there in dangerous places serving our country and they don't have confidence that we're going to save them -- or that we're going to save them.>
<HANNITY: I want to remind the audience, though -- and Kris, you can talk to on this...>
<PARONTO: Sure.>
<HANNITY: -- because your husband was a hero. Your husband defied orders, risked his entire career... (CROSSTALK)>
<HANNITY: You did the same thing. You were told to stand down, correct?>
<PARONTO: And Ty is a hero, not was a hero. >
<HANNITY: He is a hero. So... (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: Here is what we've now learned since. There were 600 separate requests for...>
<PARONTO: For what?>
<HANNITY: -- for security that were denied before while the while Great Britain and the Red Cross left... (CROSSTALK)>
<HANNITY: Because things were so bad.>
<PARONTO: I remember them pulling out, yes.>
<HANNITY: And then during the attack, there were multiple requests -- this was all being seen in live video.>
<PARONTO: Sure.>
<HANNITY: And then afterwards, you were in Germany and you told me that they said this was a spontaneous demonstration...>
<PARONTO: I -- the first thing I saw and I told people to turn on the TV and I saw Susan Rice and her on TV saying it was due to some video and some protest. And I'll be honest with you, I didn't get angry. I turned the TV off and because of all the things that I've seen over those years of deploying under the Obama administration, I turned it off and I said, par for the course and I went back to bed.>
<HANNITY: Yes?>
<PARONTO: So it was almost like I expected to see them start to cover it up. And -- and then it just steamrolled from there.>
<HANNITY: Unbelievable. What would you like to tell Mr. Trump about what needs to change?>
<PARONTO: You know, I believe in the vetting process. I do. Now, the terrorists -- and I've been deploying for 10 years. The terrorists overseas utilize our strengths, with our compassion and empathy, against us.>
<TRUMP:> True.
<PARONTO: That what they're doing right now.>
<TRUMP:> True.
<PARONTO: So I do agree that vetting is necessary. I also agree that -- that -- and when you speak of the Muslim community a -- you're right, not all Muslims are bad. But the Muslim community in America, they are Americans because they're here. They need to start speaking out publicly and condemning it. (APPLAUSE)>
<PARONTO: So...>
<HANNITY: Let me bring in...>
<PARONTO: I do believe that. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: Kimberly Munley. Kimberly, how many times were you shot at Fort Hood, which, by the way, was workplace violence and not terrorism. How many times were you shot?>
<MUNLEY: Three times.>
<HANNITY: Three times. And -- and also, we have Howard Ray. And you were a survivor of Fort Hood?>
<RAY: Yes, sir.>
<UNKNOWN: Yes.>
<HANNITY: Tell us your stories. Kimberly?>
<MUNLEY: As you may remember, on November 5th, 2009, there was a -- I got the recall -- the call of shots fired, uh, multiple injuries and arriving on the screen, uh, engaged the shooter, shot him twice. He still shot me three times. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: Did you hear him yell ""Allahu Akbar?"">
<MUNLEY: I did not personally. Where he started the massacre at inside the building, when I engaged him was outside of the building. Uh, I never spoke a word to him, he never spoke a word to me. Uh, after I went down, my weapon malfunctioned from the impact of falling and he walked up to me and put his gun to my head and pulled his trugg -- trigger and his malfunctioned, as well.>
<HANNITY: And you had to get a new... (BOOS)>
<TRUMP:> Wow! <BOOS>
<TRUMP:> Wow!
<UNKNOWN: That was (INAUDIBLE).>
<UNKNOWN: The day of November 5th, 2009, I had showed up, uh, to the SRP site and, uh, soldier readiness processing station. And, uh, I was actually there for an appointment, uh, in a building just, uh, adjacent to where the shooting initially took place. I heard the shorts ring out and I was like well, this isn't right. And so we took action to make sure that, I got all of my, uh, fellow soldiers and co-workers and a group facilitator out of the, uh, out of the building. (CROSSTALK)>
<UNKNOWN: It was, you know, it -- quite, uh, chaotic. What ended up happening was a woman ended up freezing out the door, uh, on the way out. And I realized that it's from -- from experience, that she -- she froze up. She was lost. I grabbed her. We run out back and there was someone that yelled, ""He's coming around, he's coming around!"" And so that day, I was in civilian clothes. I reached back for my pistol. I was -- I had very, uh, good opportunity and time to take care of the situation, looked down into an empty holster only to tell the woman who is -- who is now in -- in total tears and -- and crying, as she should, uh, because it was such a terrifying situation, where she, uh, I said we've got to go and so we ended up running across the park, back to the parking lot. I put myself in front of her. He came around the corner and raised his gun. And I said, here it is. And, ultimately, I -- I ended up unscathed, but subsequently, I got her to safety. I was given an award for saving the lives of, uh, my colleagues that day. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: These are the victims of real life terror that is hurting our homeland. San Bernardino, Orlando, Chattanooga, abroad, France, Germany, Belgium, all of Europe. The impact immigration has on this. Vetting refugees -- is it possible? We want to thank our -- our guests for being here. Thank you so much for coming and sharing your stories. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: When we come back, we'll talk to Mr. Trump about how to keep the homeland safe, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. We're in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with Donald Trump for the entire hour. And we're talking about protecting the homeland, defeating ISIS, winning this war on terror. These are the real victims. They don't get a -- you know, Boston happens, we move on. Chattanooga happens, we move on. The people in Orlando are still living in the aftermath of what happened at that -- at that nightclub.>
<TRUMP:> Right. And there will be more. Look, we can be nice about it. We can say it's never going to happen again. There will be more. And what we're doing by allowing thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of people in here that we just don't know anything about, it's going to happen again, because there's something wrong. And until we figure it out, we have to stop it. And that was really a large part of the speech that I just -- I just <INAUDIBLE>...
<HANNITY: I want to get into that... (CROSSTALK)>
<HANNITY: -- I want to get into the extreme vetting in a minute. You're a regular -- don't worry. I have -- I know how to do my job. It's alright. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: I want to get into this, because this is a really important question. Yesterday, you talked about countries that live under Sharia and about people that want to come here from countries. If you go -- grow up, for example, in Saudi Arabia...>
<TRUMP:> Right.
<HANNITY: -- which gave The Clinton Foundation up to $25 million, The Clinton Library... (BOOS)>
<HANNITY: -- $10 million, it -- OK. And I can't find any -- I can't find any instances where Hillary criticized them. Women can't drive. Women are told how to dress. Women are told if they can go to school or if they can go to work. Uh, we know that gays and lesbians in Saudi Arabia can get the death penalty. You can't build a -- a Jewish temple. There's a guy over here with a sign that says, ""Jews for Trump!"" (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: And -- and you can't build a Christian church. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: Would you have a -- would you ever take money from a country that treats gays, lesbians, Jews and Christians that way?>
<TRUMP:> Well, you don't want to do that and...
<HANNITY: And women?>
<TRUMP:> -- and if they knew about it, that would be one thing. And I assume they knew about it big league. But certainly they know about it now, so maybe they can give the money back. I've -- I've actually called... <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> -- I've actually called...
<HANNITY: Wait a minute, they knew about it because that has been Saudi Arabia's practice for years.>
<TRUMP:> And you know what? Let's give them the benefit of the doubt. They certainly knew about <INAUDIBLE>...
<HANNITY: You're going to give Hillary the benefit of the doubt? I'm not. OK, go ahead.>
<TRUMP:> And but do you know what -- you know what... <BOOS>
<HANNITY: Yes?>
<TRUMP:> They should give the money back. And I've been saying this for a long time. They should give the money back. 
<HANNITY: Should they give the money back? (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: Yes. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: What did you say, though... (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: I guess (INAUDIBLE). Um... (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: -- what did you say, though, she claims to be the champion of women's rights and gay and lesbian rights and -- and freedom of thought and -- and religion.>
<TRUMP:> Well, you know, look, uh, there's a whole big phony deal going on. And I have to say, when we were talking about Benghazi, uh, the end, I don't know if everybody remembers it. I remember it. At 3:00 in the morning, essentially, who do you want to be at that phone at 3:00 in the morning? We have some people... <BOOS>
<TRUMP:> -- we have some people... <BOOS>
<TRUMP:> -- oh, I'll be -- hey, I'll be up, I will tell you that. <CHANTING>
<TRUMP:> She was... <CHANTING>
<TRUMP:> -- not too effective. <CHANTING>
<HANNITY: Wow! (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: You know... (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> -- you know, the amazing thing, because that was a big ad and everybody made a big deal and she said she'd be there at 3:00. She wasn't there. But...
<HANNITY: This was four in the afternoon.>
<TRUMP:> But -- but she had a certain friend... <CROSSTALK>
<TRUMP:> -- that was contacting her routinely all day and all week and all the time, routinely, and you had 600 messages trying to get through, different forms of message, and not one of those messages got through.
<HANNITY: What is extreme vetting and what does that mean and how do you -- for example, if somebody grows up in a country where the Clintons take all their money from, if they grow up there... (LAUGHTER)>
<HANNITY: -- and then they think that men can tell women how to dress and they can't drive and they can't go to school and you can't build a church or a temple, and you grow up, then you want to come to America, how do you possibly...>
<TRUMP:> Well, look...
<HANNITY: -- vet what's in their heart?>
<TRUMP:> Right. Well, let me just you, you get very smart people. And there are those people. And they're very good at understanding what's going on. But beyond that, you use social media, because a lot of these people -- I mean they're better at social media than we are. ISIS, if you look at what ISIS is doing with social, they're recruiting over the Internet. And I also said we have to end that. We have to knock it out. We have to -- you know, some people would say oh, that's a terrible thing. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We have to end that. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> But -- but, Sean, when you look at what's going on with the Internet and how ISIS is using the Internet and what they're doing and what they're doing to us and then you have people in our country that say oh, you can't do that, that's doing something so bad to us, here we are, people -- they want to blow us up. We have to be very careful. We have to take them out very swiftly, because weapons are getting stronger and stronger, meaner and meaner, and believe me, they want to come over here. Now, again, I was one that didn't want to go over there. But now you have no chance -- really, you have no choice. Now, one thing, when Obama announced when he's going out and we're going to -- all they did is they sat back. I couldn't believe it, when I was watching, I was watching this conference and he was talking about getting out and when they were getting out. I -- I'm sitting there, I can't believe that he would say it. And even Hillary Clinton, when she talks about the different things, she wants to -- why can't we just be quiet and do the job? Why can't we be quiet... <APPLAUSE>
<HANNITY: This is important.>
<TRUMP:> -- and do the job?
<HANNITY: And you say you don't want to telegraph what...>
<TRUMP:> I don't want to telegraph now...
<HANNITY: You don't want to (INAUDIBLE)...>
<TRUMP:> No, I don't want to tell them.
<HANNITY: But -- but when you talk about extreme vetting, and you did talk about in the cold war, we did have ideological test screening and this -- this goes into your thinking, and how do you stop -- how do you possibly you -- know if somebody grows up under Sharia, and these extreme viewpoints that are the antithesis of our constitutional...>
<TRUMP:> OK. So when you look at, uh, San Bernardino, right, which was a horror show. She came in. She probably radicalized the husband. What a -- what a couple that was. That was a real beauty. <LAUGHTER>
<TRUMP:> So if they would have looked at social media, they would have seen that this woman was trouble.
<HANNITY: She was radicalized.>
<TRUMP:> We didn't look at social media. They just came in. Uh, they actually killed people that gave them a baby, uh, a baby shower -- a baby party. They had a child. They -- the 14 people that were killed, they were at the party honoring the birth of their baby and then they went in and they shot them all, killed them all. Look, there's something going on. It's a sick deal. It's beyond just normal...
<HANNITY: All right, so let me follow-up on that.>
<TRUMP:> Sean... 
<HANNITY: Yes?>
<TRUMP:> -- this is a sick, sick deal.
<HANNITY: Agree. A sick ideology. This is an advancement of a caliphate that wants worldwide either convert or die. Here's my -- my question, then. You -- you pointed out that this guy, the father of this Orlando shooter -- and he was smiling, as you said, and Hillary -- and you talked about her stupidity and her weaknesses, what -- and he has explained his radical views. What do we do when we find somebody that has extreme views? Do we throw them the hell out?>
<TRUMP:> I'd throw him out. If you look at him, I'd throw him out. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> You know, I looked at him. And you look, he's smiling.
<HANNITY: Yes.>
<TRUMP:> He had the red cap on. I thought it was one of my caps. I said no, no. <LAUGHTER>
<TRUMP:> Make America great again, I don't think so. But he has the red cap. He's got a big smile on his face during the whole thing. He obviously liked what he heard, OK, from her. Look, we have to be so tough and so smart and so vigilant. And frankly, the Muslims have to help us, because they see what's going on in their community. We don't see it. They have to help us. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And if they're not going to help us, they're to blame, also. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> But in -- in San Bernardino, they saw bombs laying around the apartment...
<HANNITY: They didn't want to say anything.>
<TRUMP:> -- in the apartment. And people saw it. And they wanted to be -- they called it racial profiling. We didn't want to call in because of racial profiling. In other words, a lawyer got to them and said you've got a problem here, you knew this was there, say racial profiling. But look, we have -- whether it's racial profiling or politically correct, we'd better get smart. We are letting tens of thousands of people into our country. We don't know what the hell we're doing.
<HANNITY: And we can keep people like that (INAUDIBLE). We've go to take a break. We'll come back. We have more with Donald Trump. We're at The Pabst Theater. We're in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. That are more as HANNITY continues, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)>
<OBAMA: ISIL is not a caliphate, it's a crime ring.>
<CLINTON: Under President Obama and Vice President Biden, we are making progress.>
<OBAMA: ISIL is on the defensive.>
<UNKNOWN: And what's the problem with radical Islam?>
<CLINTON: Well, the problem is that that sounds like we are declaring war against a religion.>
<UNKNOWN: Allahu Akbar.>
<OBAMA: There's no magic to the phrase radical Islam. It's a political talking point.>
<CLINTON: Our enemy are these criminal killers who misuse a religion.>
<OBAMA: ISIL is not Islamic. No religion condones the killing of innocents.>
<CLINTON: You can talk about Islamists. I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.>
<OBAMA: ISIL does not speak for Islam. They're thugs and killers, part of a cult of death. (END VIDEO CLIP)>
<HANNITY: All right, the Islamic State is not Islamic. There's no such thing as radical Islamic terrorism. By the way, they're the JV team, and, of course, they are contained and they do not represent an existential threat to the United States of America. Those are the words of President Obama and candidate Hillary Clinton. We continue now with Donald Trump. We're in Milwaukee at The Pabst Theater. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: And also joining us, the author of ""The New York Times"" best-seller, ""Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War."" Dr. Gorka is with us. He's the professor of strategy and irregular warfare at The Institute of World Politics at Marine University. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: All right, so these are (INAUDIBLE) JV team, they're contained, they're not an existential threat. We see the victims that we interviewed earlier. What don't the -- what does the president and Hillary not understand about this evil in our time?>
<GORKA: Sean, they don't understand the reality. The war is real and the war is here. The war is here. The victims are here. This is a threat that is real and it's escalating every day. ISIS makes between $2 million and $4 million every 24 hours. It has -- it has captured territory larger than the U.K., with six million people living on their territory and has recruited 80,000 jihadists.>
<HANNITY: And every 84 hours, there's another attack.>
<GORKA: Outside of you -- so there -- there's this hellhole in Iraq and Syria. Outside of the battle zone, every 84 hours since June there's been a jihadi attack.>
<HANNITY: OK, Donald Trump, I know he gets beat up by the media, but he says he's going to have extreme vetting and he's going to build a wall. Who's going to pay for it? (CROSSTALK)>
<HANNITY: But it...>
<TRUMP:> That's -- by the way, that's a little bit of a different subject, but it's all...
<HANNITY: But no, it's actually related, though, isn't it? >
<TRUMP:> It's related. A little different, but it's related.
<HANNITY: Right. You know, will those policies that he's advocating versus what we hear from them, will it keep -- we have -- let me -- let me backtrack. There's 1,000 FBI investigations ongoing now about ISIS in America in all 50 states, including Wisconsin. Will the policies Mr. Trump is advocating keep everybody here and across the country safer, in your professional opinion?>
<GORKA: Absolutely. Let -- let's take politics... (APPLAUSE)>
<GORKA: -- let -- let's take politics out of the equation. We have killed or arrested 108 people linked to ISIS in the last two years in America. Linked to ISIS. Not al Qaeda in ISIS, just ISIS. If you don't have borders, you don't have security. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: Is there anything -- you -- you heard him speak yesterday and I -- I -- you can talk directly -- is there anything else you would add so we can keep the homeland safe? And if you say we can defeat ISIS, can we defeat it as -- as Mr. Trump is saying, without ground troops?>
<GORKA: Uh, we don't have to be the -- the face of this war. It has to be our allies in the region. This is why Mr. Trump's speech was essential. It has to be our Muslim buddies, the Jordanians, who have suffered so much, the Egyptians... (CROSSTALK)>
<GORKA: Absolutely.>
<HANNITY: The Saudis...>
<GORKA: This -- we'll talk about that later.>
<HANNITY: OK. (LAUGHTER)>
<GORKA: Um, it has to be the Jordanians, the Egyptians, who are the face of this war.>
<HANNITY: Yes.>
<GORKA: We can provide the training, the Special Forces advisers, but we don't need to be the face of this war. The most important thing that Mr. Trump said, this is an ideological war like the cold war. We have got to destroy the brand of jihad.>
<HANNITY: How dangerous is the Syrian refugees? And is it a better idea -- by the way, I'm -- I'm talking as if you're not here. Hi.>
<TRUMP:> OK.
<HANNITY: No, but 550 percent increase...>
<TRUMP:> Right.
<HANNITY: -- that Hillary wants in Syrian refugees. You're offering to provide a safe zone, protected militarily.>
<TRUMP:> Paid for by somebody else.
<HANNITY: Paid for by other people. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: By the way, Obama did accumulate more debt than every other president before him combined.>
<TRUMP:> Doubled it.
<HANNITY: A...>
<TRUMP:> Doubled it.
<HANNITY: -- so, but you'd also provide food, water, medicine, supplies, cots, baby formula?>
<TRUMP:> Right. You'd take it...
<HANNITY: That sounds pretty liberal... (CROSSTALK)>
<HANNITY: -- in Syria?>
<TRUMP:> In Syria.
<HANNITY: Yes.>
<TRUMP:> They have plenty of land, that I can tell you. But in Syria, there's plenty of money, because you look at the Gulf states, you like at the kind of money they have, there's nobody seen money like that. And they're not doing anything.
<HANNITY: All right, last question -->
<TRUMP:> They're not doing anything.
<HANNITY: -- James Comey, James Clapper, General John Allen, uh, Michael Steinbeck, the -- the assistant FBI director, the House Homeland Security, uh, secretary, have all warned us and -- and Brennan, our CIA director, that ISIS will infiltrate this refugee population. So is Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama gambling with the lives of these American people by taking them in, yes or -- um...>
<GORKA: If Hillary Clinton becomes the commander-in-chief and continues the policies of this administration... (BOOS)>
<GORKA: -- American lives will be endangered.>
<HANNITY: So they're...>
<GORKA: (INAUDIBLE).>
<HANNITY: Is it fair to say they will have blood on their hands if refugees kill Americans?>
<GORKA: They already do. Two... (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: All right, we're going to have to break. Dr. Gorka, good to see you. Thank you.>
<GORKA: Thank you.>
<HANNITY: When we come back, we'll have more with Donald Trump and his plan to take out ISIS and radical extremists. Protecting the Homeland, a special edition of HANNITY continues from Milwaukee. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)>
<HANNITY: Is there anything else you would add so we can keep the homeland safe and defeat -- you say we can defeat ISIS. Can we defeat it, as Mr. Trump was saying, without ground troops?>
<UNKNOWN: We don't have to be the face of this war. It has to be our allies in the region. This is why Mr. Trump's speech was essential. It would have to be our Muslim buddies, the Jordanians who have suffered so much, the Egyptians...>

<HANNITY: When we come back, we'll have more with Donald Trump and his plan to take out ISIS and radical extremists, protecting the homeland. A special edition of ""Hannity"" continues from Milwaukee. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" We continue with Donald Trump. And we are from Milwaukee Wisconsin. Mr. Trump, all right, I know you get advice from a lot of people... (CROSSTALK)>
<TRUMP:> Everybody.
<HANNITY: Everybody has got advice for you?>
<TRUMP:> Everybody, right, everybody.
<HANNITY: All right. One of the things -- I watched your speech yesterday, and I watched what you did, you laid out everything wrong that you felt Hillary and Obama have done. You laid out your solutions to how you would handle it differently. And the only thing that I know that friends of mine -- I was at a party the other night, I know you know Mr. Trump, we love him, please tell him to only talk about Hillary and Obama. (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: Well, wait a minute, do you all agree with that? (APPLAUSE)>
<HANNITY: All right. Because in 84 days we're electing a president, and they're the only two people that matter. What do you say to those that say don't talk about... (CROSSTALK)>
<TRUMP:> I really do, mostly. But, you know, a lot of times the mainstream media, they put it on like, if I'm talking about anything else, they'll put that on. She is so protected. They are so protecting her. She hasn't had a news conference in like 250 days.
<HANNITY: I think she's in the Witness Protection Program.>
<TRUMP:> Well, she is being protected by the government, definitely. I mean, how she got away with the emails is beyond anything I've ever seen in justice. But I have to say, she's being protected, and she's being protected by the media. When I say something about her, for instance, if I speak for an hour, and I talk about her for a half an hour, 45 minutes, nothing gets on television. They'll put something else on, but they won't...
<HANNITY: You mentioned The New York Times or Mr. Khan or the judge.>
<TRUMP:> Other things get on television... <CROSSTALK>
<HANNITY: Do you think it's better not to talk about that?>
<TRUMP:> Look, let me just say, she's totally protected. I've never seen anything like it.
<HANNITY: By the media.>
<TRUMP:> And she doesn't really do that much. She'll give a speech on teleprompter, and then she'll disappear. I don't know if she goes home -- she goes home and goes to sleep. I think she sleeps.
<HANNITY: Take weekends off.>
<TRUMP:> I guess she takes a lot of weekends off. She takes a lot of time off. And you know that's, frankly -- frankly, it's really not fair.
<HANNITY: You know, I look at -- I've asked you a lot about the economy. We've got the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s.>
<TRUMP:> Yes, right.
<HANNITY: Lowest homeownership rate in 51 years, the worst recovery since the '40s. We've got 12 million more Americans on food stamps, 58 percent increase in the black community on food stamps. We've got 8 million to 10 million more people in poverty. My question is this, forgetting the media, is -- are we -- I have interviewed you a lot. How -- how certain does the wall get built? How certain does Obamacare get repealed?>
<TRUMP:> You never say 100 percent, but I'm telling you pretty close 100 percent the wall gets built. We need it. You know, the Border Patrol... <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> The Border Patrol agents have endorsed me, along with Sheriff Joe and everyone else. <CROSSTALK>
<HANNITY: I'm running out of time. So when you say...>
<TRUMP:> It gets built.
<HANNITY: And you will rebuild the military, that's a promise?>
<TRUMP:> We have to rebuild, it's all depleted. The military is depleted.
<HANNITY: And you will send education back to the states.>
<TRUMP:> One hundred percent.
<HANNITY: And you will make America energy independent. Can you do it in four years?>
<TRUMP:> It could be done faster than that. We have regulations that are absolutely destroying our energy companies.
<HANNITY: And will you appoint originalist justices like Scalia?>
<TRUMP:> Yes, I've already announced who the 11 could be. I have 11 people from which to pick. And I want to get as close to Scalia as I can. <APPLAUSE>
<HANNITY: And you will repeal Obamacare and protect our Second Amendment rights.>
<TRUMP:> You know, Obamacare is dying of its own volition, if you look at the <INAUDIBLE> of Obamacare. You saw what happened with Aetna today. It's really... <CROSSTALK>
<HANNITY: And those are promises you're telling the people of Wisconsin...>
<TRUMP:> One hundred percent, I'm telling you too. <APPLAUSE>
<HANNITY: All right. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left this evening. As always, thank you for being with us. We will see you back here tomorrow night. Thank you, Wisconsin, thank you, Milwaukee. >","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-08-22"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody. So we began one hour early because the place is packed, so why should we wait? <APPLAUSE> Thank you. It's great to be in Ohio. <APPLAUSE> I love this state, I do, I love this state where I once worked and had great experience. And I must tell you, above all, I love the people of Ohio. <APPLAUSE> And I have a very special message for you tonight. We are going to win Ohio. We are going to win the White House. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to bring back your jobs that have been taken from your state and every other state in the union. <APPLAUSE> We're going to negotiate fair trade deals, and what I mean by fair is great, that put the American worker first. <APPLAUSE> We're going to stop the product dumping, all over the place, dumping, and we're going to stop the unfair foreign subsidies and the currency manipulation, which is a form of cheating. <APPLAUSE> We are going to stop all forms of cheating. We're going to bring our workers back. We're going to bring our country back. We're going to bring companies back into our country. They're going to hire lots of people. You're going to get great jobs again. You're going to get jobs that pay you a lot more money than you're making right now, because I know what's happened to the American worker. <APPLAUSE> The era of economic surrender, which is what we've been doing for so long, is over. <APPLAUSE> A new era of real American greatness is ready to begin if I get elected president. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than the state of Ohio. Hillary Clinton backed her husband's NAFTA, one of the worst deals made in the history of our country, maybe the worst trade deal made ever anywhere in the world. That's how bad. She backed China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. She backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she called the gold standard. One bad deal after another. Hillary Clinton's donors own her, they own her lock, stock and barrel. They own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do. And when they own companies and they want that company to move to Mexico, folks, your jobs are gone. OK? You don't have a chance. That's the way the system works. Ohio and the Akron area have lost nearly one-third of the manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. One-third, think of that, and getting worse. And as you stand here tonight, there are companies right now negotiating to leave. OK? You'll find out about it, but we'll stop them, just hang in there. And it won't be hard, won't be hard. <APPLAUSE> This region and this state have lost nearly one in four manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization. Our annual trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion, is that's even believable, $800 billion. We have some great negotiators on our side, don't we? This subtracts directly from our growth. Our economy grew only 1.2 percent in the last quarter, that's a total disaster. That means there's no growth and it's getting worse, not better, it's getting worse. This is the legacy of Barack Hussein Obama. And Hillary Clinton will be four more years, and it will be worse, in my opinion. I am promising a new legacy for America. We are going to create a new American future. But to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We have to. <APPLAUSE> And to do that, you're going to have to on November 8th elect Donald J. Trump as your president. <APPLAUSE> Thank you -- November 8th. Our trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs just last year. Think of it, 100,000 jobs. They're ripping them out of our country. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved. Hillary Clinton, who called the TPP the gold standard, would approve and, by the way, 100 percent, 100 percent approval, she's going to approve it. If you remember, her closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed that that's what she's going to do with a wink and a nod. We can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. That will be, in my opinion, as bad, if that's possible, as bad as NAFTA. We will win this election and we will keep America out of TPP, among many, many other things. <APPLAUSE> We will defend our freedom, our jobs and our economic independence. It's going to be America first. It's not going to be America last, America seventh, America 5th because we want to take care of some company or take care of another country that's taking care of our politicians. I put up my money, folks. You know what? If I don't make it, I've wasted a lot of money, time and energy, that I can tell you, a lot. But I think we're going to win big. I actually think there's something going on. There's something going on. <APPLAUSE> There is something going on, whether it's here or in Pennsylvania or in Virginia or Florida. I go to the arenas, I start an hour, I start two hours early, and the places are packed with people outside. I can start early because they'll fill up hours before I'm supposed to be there. There's an enthusiasm that's going on that nobody has ever seen before. There is something going on. <APPLAUSE> My economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, which in many cases haven't gone up in real wage for over 18 years. You're making less money now. Many of the people in this room making less money now than you made 18 years ago. You're working harder and, in some cases, you have two jobs. It's not supposed to work that way, it's supposed to be the other way. You're getting older, you're working harder, you're making less. Not going to happen. We are going to create millions and millions of new jobs. <APPLAUSE> Here are a few of the things we are going to do. This you will like. A massive tax cut for working Americans and a 15 percent tax rate for small businesses. <APPLAUSE> Look at those people, they're still pouring in. I love seeing it, pouring in. <APPLAUSE> It's really -- thank you -- it's beautiful, beautiful, look.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> It's really beautiful. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. See, to me that means so much. When you see that scene, look at the doors, pouring in, all filling up, unbelievable, unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> I don't know how I explain to them that we started an hour early. I don't know. Thank you, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you. We are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama administration's new anti-energy rules that will lift your energy bills up by more than 40 percent very, very shortly. These Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are a tax on the poor, and they devastate low-income, African-American and Latino Americans. It is a disaster. Ohio gets 60 percent of its electricity from coal-powered energy. Right? <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton says she wants to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. Exactly, just like she wants to put the steelworkers out of business. She wants to put a lot of businesses out of business. We are going to put the miners and the steelworkers back to work. And we are going to get your energy bills down fast. <APPLAUSE> We are going to repeal and replace ""Obamacare,"" saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade alone. <APPLAUSE> Another major part of our agenda is law and order. <APPLAUSE> More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago alone since the beginning of this year. This is one of the biggest differences between me and my opponent. I believe that safety is a right that belongs to all Americans -- all Americans. <APPLAUSE> And I want to take this opportunity to thank the law enforcement and police officials that are here with us tonight... <APPLAUSE> ... and all across the country, for their service and sacrifice in these very dangerous, especially for them, dangerous and difficult times. They are terrific, so thank you to law enforcement and police. <APPLAUSE> Working with citizens and police, we will bring safety to communities across this land, but especially to those and these places that have not known safety in a very, very long time. I want every parent and child in this society, including, so importantly, every African-American and Hispanic citizen, to be able to live in a safe, thriving and prosperous community. It's time. <APPLAUSE> This is the new American future that we're working all together to create. Hillary Clinton is the past. She's been there forever, she's done nothing but mistakes. She's got bad, bad judgment, mistake after mistake. We are the future. <APPLAUSE> Another major part of our agenda is immigration security. We need to protect American jobs. We need to protect American safety. <APPLAUSE> We're going to build a wall, folks. We're going to build a wall. We're going to build it, don't worry. We're going to build a wall. <APPLAUSE> That wall will go up so fast your head will spin. And you'll say, you know, he meant it. And you know what else I mean? Mexico is going to pay for the wall. <APPLAUSE> Low-income workers are hurt the most by my opponent's policies. Poor Hispanic and African-American citizens are the first to lose a job or see a pay cut when we don't control our borders. So true. According to Pew Research, immigration over the next 50 years will add another 100 million to our population. We will be much, much more and it's going to be much, much more under Hillary Clinton's radical plans. She's got a radical plan. You know where she got it? She got it probably from Bernie who took her so far left. Wait until you see what she does to the United States Supreme Court. But we're not going to give her that chance, OK? We're not going to give her that chance. <APPLAUSE> That's so unfair to the low-income workers, African-American, Latino, all Americans, living here today and trying to get a job and get ahead. Hillary Clinton's plan amounts to total and absolute total open borders. It's open borders. I've met with the families who have lost loved ones to sanctuary cities and violence spilling across our border, parents like my friend Jamiel Shaw, Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden and Laura Wilkerson. Hillary Clinton is either too corrupt or too cowardly to meet with the families of those killed by the policies she and Obama support. Hillary Clinton has totally has forgotten the first rule of public service. The job of an elected official is to serve the citizens of the United States. That's what the job is. And if you don't understand that, then you are not fit to run for the office of president of the United States. <APPLAUSE> If you are not prepared to put American workers first, then you should not hold or seek public office. We're not working for somebody else. We're not working for another country. It's just that simple. No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as secretary of state. As the evidence has become public over the last several months, I have become increasingly shocked by the vast scope of Hillary Clinton's criminality. It's criminality, everybody knows it, everybody knows it. Our country has gotten so far behind, everybody knows it. Hillary Clinton said she turned over all of her work-related e-mails.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> She testified that to Congress under penalty of perjury. Now we learn about another 15,000 e-mails she failed to turn over and they have just been discovered, I guess today. And don't forget, the 33,000 e-mails she's already deleted. Colin Powell just proved again how dishonest Hillary Clinton is after he busted her for trying to pin the e-mail scandal on him, one more Hillary Clinton lie. Her foundation took in large payments from major corporations and wealthy individuals, foreign and domestic, and all the while she was secretary of state. The Clinton Foundation accepted as much as $60 million from Middle Eastern countries that oppress women, gays and people of different faiths. The foundation donors included corporations and individuals with significant matters before the State Department. Not good. And then either Hillary Clinton herself or one of her closest aides took action favorable to these donors. Her actions corrupted and disgraced one of the most important departments of government, indeed one of only four established by the United States Constitution itself. The Clintons made the State Department into the same kind of pay-for-play operation as the Arkansas government was. Now, think of what happened back then. Think about it. And I love the state of Arkansas, we're winning it big, but I'll tell you, they know what went on. They know and they're not happy. Pay the Clinton Foundation huge sums of money and throw in some big speaking fees for Bill Clinton and you got to play, you got to do what you wanted to do. It's pretty sad. This is in front of the State Department. This is in front of the State Department. And long before that, you should have seen what they were doing in Arkansas. Same old story, folks. The amounts involved, the favors done and the significant number of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a special prosecutor immediately, immediately, immediately. <APPLAUSE> After the FBI and Department of Justice whitewashed Hillary Clinton's e-mail crimes, they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton's new crimes which happen all the time. Some former prosecutors have even suggested that the coordination between the pay-for-play State Department and the corrupt Clinton Foundation constitute a clear example of RICO, racketeering influenced corrupt organization, enterprise. The Justice Department is required to appoint an independent Special Prosecutor because it has proven itself to be really, sadly a political arm of the White House. Nobody has ever seen anything like this before. The Department of Justice has acted very unethically, particularly the attorney general's private, lengthy, 39-minute meeting in the back of an airplane before the department's decision not to prosecute her for crimes that would have been prosecuted against any other citizen in our country. If the Justice Department fails to do so, it will make it even clearer that a second of four primary constitutional departments have been corrupted. It's as simple as that. Every major lawyer, you look, every major lawyer is saying the same thing. They can't believe it happened. They know the facts, they can't believe it happened. The Justice Department and the FBI, they cannot believe what's going on in this country. And other countries are talking about it and they can't believe what's happening either. Here's one example of Clinton corruption. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to the Russians. Wonderful deal. You know what happens to uranium? You all know what happens to uranium, and they need it in Russia. Clinton's approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions and millions of dollars. In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions and millions of dollars in donations. In addition, Bill Clinton received over $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal. Here is another example of pay-for-play. In 2009, a company called Ericsson came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments, including Sudan, Syria and Iran. Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people. In June 2011, Hillary Clinton's State Department began adding goods and services to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism. During that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000, his highest-paying speech. In April 2012, the Obama administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria, but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson's work in Iran. A Trump administration will end the government corruption. <APPLAUSE> No one will be above the law. We will have one set of rules for everyone. In Hillary Clinton's world, we have one set of rules for her and another set of rules for everyone else. I am fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice. I will be your voice, believe me. <APPLAUSE> I just get the feeling we're going to win in a landslide. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers. My campaign is powered by my money, but also by small donations from working people across this country who want their country back. <APPLAUSE> The average donation last month was about $61, so beautiful to see that. And that doesn't happen often with our Republicans, and that's OK. But I'll tell you, so glad to see it. It's a movement. Folks, it's a movement that's going on. This is a movement. This is a movement. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everybody working, and I mean everybody and everyday working people, give $5, $10, $15 to a campaign like ours. They are very concerned. They couldn't believe when they saw the numbers. It is in fact something very, very special that's happening because it's never really happened like this, certainly for the Republican Party it's never happened like this before. <APPLAUSE> We're going to take government away from the special interests that give her tens of millions of dollars so that she can broadcast absolutely phony adds about me, and we're going to give it back to the voters. And by the way, those ads are absolutely phony with the exception of certain little parts of them. A couple of little things are correct, but we'll get over it. <LAUGHTER> Come November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you and your family and your country, not the special interests, the donors and the lobbyists. <APPLAUSE> We are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas and remember those three famous words: peace through strength. <APPLAUSE> We are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat and utterly destroy ISIS. We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don't support our tolerant values. We are going to have extreme vetting. Remember, extreme vetting. We want people in our country, but we want people that have the ability to love us and respect us. <APPLAUSE> We are also going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future. So true. That is so true. <APPLAUSE> The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city for 50 years, 60 years, 70 years, and even more than a hundred years. They have produced only poverty, failing schools and broken homes. In the last eight years, the African-American labor force participation has declined another 3 percentage points, and it's dropped another 6 percentage points for teenagers, and that's already from the most dismal numbers in history. Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty. African-American home ownership has declined nearly 10 percentage points from record levels. This is just in the last short while. Also, since 2009, another 2 million Latinos have fallen into poverty. Incomes for Latino workers fell by almost another $1,000 a year. Again, by terrible standards. Meanwhile, homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and more than 60 percent in Baltimore and up all over the place, no matter where you look. The level of crime in these cities is something no American should consider acceptable. It should not be considered acceptable. <APPLAUSE> Our government has totally failed our African-American friends, our Hispanic friends, and the people of our country, period. The Democrats have failed completely in the inner cities. For those hurting the most, who have been failed and failed by their politicians, year after year, failure after failure, worse numbers after worse numbers, poverty, rejection, horrible education, no housing, no homes, no ownership, crime at levels that nobody's seen. You can go to war zones in countries that we're fighting and it's safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats. And I ask you this, I ask you this: Crime, all of the problems, to the African-Americans, who I employ so many, so many people, to the Hispanics, tremendous people, what the hell do you have to lose? Give me a chance. I'll straighten it out. I'll straighten it out. <APPLAUSE> What do you have to lose? And you know, I say it and I'm going to keep saying it. And some people say, wow, that makes sense, and then some people say, well, that wasn't very nice. Look, it is a disaster the way African-Americans are living, in many cases, and, in many cases, the way Hispanics are living. And I say it with such a deep-felt feeling. What do you have to lose? I will straighten it out. <APPLAUSE> I'll bring jobs back. We'll bring spirit back. We'll get rid of the crime. You'll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Right now, you walk down the street and you get shot. Look at the statistics. We'll straighten it out. If you keep voting for the same failed politicians, you will keep getting the same results. They don't care about you, they just like you once every four years, get your vote and then they say bye-bye. <APPLAUSE> What do you have to lose? And you know what? I'll do a great job. I'll do a great job. <APPLAUSE> But most importantly, I want to talk to you about really what you have to gain. Those hurting in our country have so much to gain by joining our campaign for a new and more inclusive American future. Tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of small businesses. My energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the price of your energy bills which right now are going through the roof. <APPLAUSE> My trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions of dollars in new wealth to our country and to our people. My immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visa programs that hurt poor workers and everybody else. <APPLAUSE> My infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, your bridges, your tunnels, your airports, which are in terrible shape, the worst shape they've been in in over 50 years. My regulatory reform will make it easier for African-American small businesses to thrive and for young children to live out their dreams without crime and without being scared to walk down the street. <APPLAUSE> My promise of school choice -- you know what the word choice is, it's called competition -- my promise of the word choice, charter schools and merit pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities. Teachers, one of the most important professions; no matter what you do, there is nothing so important. <APPLAUSE> We love our teachers. We love our teachers. We've got to take care of our teachers. Got to take care of our teachers. Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice, for votes. She wants the votes. My government reforms will make your voice heard, not the voice of the special interests. Every insider getting rich off of our broken system is throwing money at Hillary Clinton. It's the powerful protecting the powerful. Excuse me, I used to be there, I know the system very well. <LAUGHTER> I know the system better than anybody. It's insiders fighting for insiders. But I am fighting for you. I'm fighting for you. <APPLAUSE> Every day, you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose the Trump campaign. That's because I don't need them, I don't want them. I'm going to do what's good for you. <APPLAUSE> Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose my campaign, I certainly don't need them. Or some big-time lobbyist says they oppose Donald Trump's campaign, because I don't want the lobbyists. I've had plenty of lobbyists, they do a good job, they get you whatever you want. I wear their opposition as a badge of honor, believe me, right here. <APPLAUSE> Because it means that I'm fighting for real change, not just partisan change or change that's going to make Hillary richer. I am fighting for all of us across the country, and we're fighting for peaceful regime change in our own country. That's what we have to have. We need it in our own country. <APPLAUSE> We have got a country that is so divided. Seldom has it ever been so totally divided. And it's very, very sad. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> The media/donor/political complex that's bled this country dry for years has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. <APPLAUSE> And all of these countries that are ripping us off and taking our jobs, all of those countries will start to respect us again, folks. <APPLAUSE> We will reject bigotry and hatred, we will reject oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity, a future built on our common culture and values as one American people. <APPLAUSE> I am asking, so importantly, where we have already seen a tremendous amount of time, it doesn't mean anything if on November 8th we come in short. It'll look good in the history books, a lot of people will say congratulations, you're not a politician, nobody's ever done this before. But you know what? It doesn't mean anything unless on November 8th we go out and we win. Believe me. <APPLAUSE> You've got to get every one of your friends, you've got to get every one of your family, you've got to get everybody to go out and watch and go out and vote. And when I saw watch, you know what I'm talking about, right? You know what I'm talking about. I think you've got to go out and you've got to watch. I'm asking for your vote so that I can be your champion in the White House, and I promise you that's what I'm going to be. <APPLAUSE> To every parent who dreams for their children and to every child who dreams for their future, of which there are so many, I say these words to you tonight: I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. <APPLAUSE> Together, we will make America strong again. Together, we will make America safe again. Together, we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you! God bless you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody. I am so happy to be back in the great state of Texas. Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> The people of Texas are proud. They're independent and they are free. <APPLAUSE> There is no better place to deliver the message I have to deliver tonight than right here, right in the middle of freedom. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Tonight's message is about re-declaring our independence as a country. <APPLAUSE> On November 8th, a very, very important date, we are going to declare our independence from special interests, corrupt politicians, and I might add, very corrupt politicians. <APPLAUSE> And from a rigged system that benefits only the insiders. We're going to bring our jobs back. We're bringing them back to our country. And we're going to create millions of new jobs. <APPLAUSE> We are going to declare our independence from politicians who don't listen to us and media executives that don't care about us. And by the way, who never report our massive and very, very friendly crowds. That's for sure. <APPLAUSE> We are going to declare our independence from rising crime, soaring poverty rates and crushing, crushing debt. We're going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a new American future. <APPLAUSE> Once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people. <APPLAUSE> Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. <APPLAUSE> It's going to be America first from now on. America first. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Let me tell you what this new future looks like. We're going to cut taxes and create millions and millions of new jobs. <APPLAUSE> And we are not going to allow other countries to steal our businesses any longer. <APPLAUSE> We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. It's a disaster. <APPLAUSE> We're going to appoint judges who will support, defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> We're going to save and cherish our Second Amendment, which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> We will ensure every veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a V.A. facility or with a private doctor of their choice if they don't get that kind of care. <APPLAUSE> We are going to eliminate job-killing regulations. We're going to unleash an American energy revolution like you've never seen before. <APPLAUSE> Let's talk about another issue that is so important to our future and the future of our children. That's the issue of crime. Violent crime is rising across the country. More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year, 2,700 people shot. <AUDIENCE BOOS> No American should consider this level of crime acceptable. Every American has the right to live in safety and peace. A Trump administration is going to restore law and order. <APPLAUSE> And while we're at it, let me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers. <APPLAUSE> This state...
<AUDIENCE: Boys in blue! Boys in blue! Boys in blue! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> This state has known unbelievable heartache in the recent days after the murder of five police officers and the wounding of another seven in the assault. And you know what we're talking about, the horrible assault on Dallas. We pray for the families and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> To all law enforcement in America, we are with you, we support you and we will always stand with you. We love you. <APPLAUSE> Together, we'll...
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Together, we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land, but especially those and for those who have not known safety in a very, very long time. And there are plenty of people in our country who have not known safety for a long time. That includes appointing an attorney general and a secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law. <APPLAUSE> I will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people. <APPLAUSE> And they are all over the place. I will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear. All citizens deserve to be protected. No American will be left behind. <APPLAUSE> I want every African-American parent in this country and all parents in this country to be able to raise their children in safety. <APPLAUSE> I want to ensure every African-American child in this country and all children in this country who are put on a ladder to success. We are going to put people in this country on the ladder to success. A good education with a great paying job, that's success. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have school choice. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have charter schools and merit pay for our great teachers. My opponent, crooked Hillary Clinton... <AUDIENCE BOOS> ... discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice and because she's owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy, and of course, Wall Street. That we know. <AUDIENCE BOOS> No one owns me. No one owns me. Believe me. <APPLAUSE> Nobody. I answer only to the American people. That's why I'm doing this. That's why I'm doing this. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. In a New York Post column recently, Deroy Murdock published data confirming what I've been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities. Murdock confirms these facts. The overall labor force participation rate...
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump! (APPLAUSE) USA! USA! USA! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> The overall labor force participation rate for Black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent down to 3.2 percent recently. This metric also slump for Black teenagers from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent, down 6.4 percent. Going in the wrong direction. Everything going in the wrong direction. Our country is going in the wrong direction. <AUDIENCE BOOS> The percentage of Black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama, the Census Bureau reports, from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent, up too much. Too much. The number of Blacks on food stamps soared under Obama to 11.7 million people in 2014, up 58.2 percent. <AUDIENCE BOOS> Also, from Obama's arrival through last June 30, the percentage of Black Americans who own homes plunged 41.7 percent. <AUDIENCE BOOS> Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty. That's no good and not fair. Fifty-eight percent of young African- Americans are not employed. Homicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore, and up throughout all of our inner cities. Violent crime rose 17 percent in the 50 largest U.S. cities. This is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton. It can't get any worse. <AUDIENCE BOOS> To those suffering, I say what do you have to lose in trying Trump? What do you have to lose? I will fix it. I will fix it. <APPLAUSE> I will fix the problem. With rates of crime, with rates of poverty like you've just heard, what do you have to lose? I will fix the problem. We will fix it. Let me tell you what we have to gain. More jobs. We'll bring them in. I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, believe me. Believe me. <APPLAUSE> Higher wages and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities. We are going to turn it all around. Give Donald Trump a chance. I say this to the African-American community, give Donald Trump a chance. We will turn it around. We will make your streets safe so when you walk down the street, you don't get shot, which is what's happening now. That's what's happening now. Success has to be created for everyone and it has to be available to everyone. That's how we're going to create a new American future. But to make every American safe and prosperous, we must address one of the most vital issues of all, border security. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!>
<TRUMP:> We are going to build the wall. <APPLAUSE> And who is going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> Mexico is going to pay for the wall. We have massive trade deficits with Mexico, with China, with Japan, with everybody. Those deficits will go away. We're going to bring our jobs back. You're going to be so happy. But Mexico in fact will pay for the wall 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> We are going to enforce the law. We're going to protect your jobs and your wages. We are going to protect them. Your companies are not going to flee our country, think they can make their product and sell it back into our country without serious repercussion. <APPLAUSE> We are going to keep our country safe. According to the Texas government, nearly 200,000 illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. <AUDIENCE BOOS> Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges... <AUDIENCE BOOS> ... and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft. <AUDIENCE BOOS> Not going to happen, folks. We're not going to let it happen to our country. It's enough. Yet Hillary Clinton wants a totally open border. <AUDIENCE BOOS> She wants catch and release. <AUDIENCE BOOS> She wants Obamacare and other things for illegal immigrants, in many cases, more than our great veterans get. <AUDIENCE BOOS> She has said she's going to give massive amnesty in her first 100 days. <AUDIENCE BOOS> She wants to gut Immigration Enforcement. The Immigration people to such a great job, but they have no leadership at the top. She supports sanctuary cities. <AUDIENCE BOOS> She wants to let people overstay their visas without removal. <AUDIENCE BOOS> One lawless order after another. We must not let that happen. We are going to vote for President Donald Trump. And we're going to stop it. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump! USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> We love Texas. <APPLAUSE> Love Texas. Hillary Clinton also wants a 550 percent increase over Obama, who's letting them come in by the thousands, in Syrian refugees. We have no idea who they are, where they come from, no paperwork. The great Trojan horse. It's going to be trouble, folks. There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9/11 and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston bombing, San Bernardino and Orlando. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the flood gates to our borders, let everybody come in, open up our country, let people pour in. We don't know anything about them. It's going to be a nightmare for our country, just like it's turning out to be an absolute nightmare for Europe. Just ask them what's going on. <AUDIENCE BOOS> I want to create safe zones in the Middle East. And we'll get the Gulf States to pay for them. We owe almost $20 trillion, folks. We're not paying. But we want to help people. Look, I have as big a heart as anybody, believe me. We have to help people. We're going to build safe zones in the Middle East. We're going to get the Gulf States to chip in to pay for them because they have the money. They're not doing what they're supposed to be doing. <APPLAUSE> My plan suspends visas when we can't perform effective screening and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who don't support our values. <APPLAUSE> I'm calling it extreme vetting, extreme vetting. After all, that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Is there any place that's better to be or safer to be than a Trump rally? <APPLAUSE> Right -- right in the heart of Texas. <APPLAUSE> This election, so important, will decide whether or not we have a border. This election will decide whether or not we have a country. Today, I met with the moms of incredible American children killed by illegal immigrants, as a result of the policies of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. <AUDIENCE BOOS> Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families. She will never hear their incredible, but so sad stories. She will never hear. She doesn't have the heart, believe me.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> I would like to invite the mothers who lost their children to illegal immigration to join me on the stage right now. These are great people. They're here with the incredible Remembrance Project. Come on up. <APPLAUSE> I also want to invite very, very special people that I've gotten to know over the years. And they've given me their endorsement, first time ever in their history. The Border Patrol, folks. They are so good. <APPLAUSE> These are incredible people. The suffering that the families have gone through is incredible. And Jamiel Shaw, another friend of mine, what he's gone through is just unbelievable. So I just want to thank you. I want to say that we are with you 100 percent. And your children did not die in vain because we're not going to allow it to happen to others. So thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> Give them a big hand. Thank you very much. Border Patrol, amazing. Come here, Shaw. Come here. Say something. Thank you. <APPLAUSE>
<UNKNOWN: Nineteen years. Nineteen years as a Border Patrol agent has taught me one thing. Our borders are not secure. Forty to 60 percent effectiveness is not a secure border, and that's what we have today. We only arrest 40 to 60 percent of those who cross the border. Donald Trump will change that. And it needs to be changed. (APPLAUSE) Your country is not safe. Our homes are not safe unless Donald Trump changes the security of the border. And he will do that. And that's why we endorsed him. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: Thank you, everyone, for believing in Mr. Trump because he is certainly alleviated our fears. I'm telling you my son was systematically tortured, beaten, murdered and set on fire. Where -- I'm an average American family. If this can happen to my family, it can happen to yours. I am looking forward to voting in Mr. Trump, who will end this slaughter of Americans. (APPLAUSE) As you can see that we have shirts of our children and some banners. I have one of another mother's shirt today because I want you to remember there are so many people and families with the Remembrance Project that are on their knees in grief that they can't get out and talk about it. Pray for those families today. And thank you so much. (APPLAUSE)>
<GIBBONEY: My name is Agnes Gibboney and my only son was murdered by an illegal alien. And I am a legal immigrant. It took my family 13 years... (APPLAUSE) Thank you. And Mrs. Trump is the only one that's going to protect your children from being slaughtered like my son was. Thank you and God bless. (APPLAUSE)>
<MENDOZA: Hello. My name is Mary Ann Mendoza. And my son, Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, Mesa, Arizona police officer, was killed when a repeat criminal illegal alien drove over 35 miles the wrong way on four different freeways in Phoenix May 12, 2014, and slammed head on into my son on his way home from work. He had been previously convicted of crimes up in Colorado. The judges showed leniency once he was caught and brought back for justice. So as I was talking to Mr. Trump earlier, please, please, please research the judges who you are voting for also because we've got crooked federal judges in our court system. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: Thank you, Texas. I'm a German legal immigrant and my only... (APPLAUSE) And my only child, my only child, my son was killed four years ago. So if a few of you still feel that compassion for illegal families not being separated, this is what I have of my family; his ashes. I have no family left. And the only one that will protect you, your family and future generations is our next president, Mr. Donald J. Trump. (APPLAUSE)>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Incredible people. What they've gone through, incredible. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, fellas. Thank you. And so many more hundreds, thousands, so many more. We will never let these families down. On immigration Clinton is bought and paid for by special interests. She's never going to do the right thing. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> This corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our country and our democracy. Every day more and more alarming facts come out. <AUDIENCE CHANTING>
<AUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA. USA... (AUDIENCE BOOS)>
<TRUMP:> What are you going to do? The scandal I speak of is the State Department's pay-for-play. It's right now being looked at very seriously. Probably nothing will happen, even though it should happen, because she is being protected by our country like nothing ever before. And it's a disgrace. And as the world watches, it's such an embarrassment to everyone in this big arena. It is a total embarrassment. If the secretary of State can be bought or bribed or sold. Look, what's happening right now with government favors then the whole American system is threatened. So many people for doing so far less are right now suffering tremendous repercussions, tremendous, for doing so far less. For doing a tiny fraction of what Hillary Clinton did. It is a disgrace. This is a threat to the foundation of democracy, a threat. This is what happens in third world countries. It's the failed conditions of people. And this is why they flee to America and they come here and they get no better. Our laws and our country is being jeopardized. America can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> The new revelations about Hillary Clinton's email scandal made clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. Hillary Clinton is desperate to cover up her crimes. And she has been unsuccessful. Except that some people that head up some very important groups have said it's OK, even though it was never OK for others. That's why she deleted 33,000 emails and she got away with it, sort of. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> That's also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and to the American public. She said she never sent or received classified materials. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> That was a lie proved over and over again. She claims she used her email server for the convenience of using only one device. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> But she used multiple devices. So that was yet another lie. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> She said she turned over all of her work-related emails. But the FBI found thousands she never turned over. And now just recently found another 15,000 more. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> That was another lie. Can you imagine? Can you imagine what she had on the 33,000 deleted emails? Can you imagine? She said she sent nothing marked classified, a total lie unmasked to the entire world. And more, and more to come. She said her server was secure and had no breaches. But we know now what was completely unsecure and the FBI director said it could be easily hacked by foreign enemies. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> More Clinton lies. Clinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them. That was a lie. And why were her lawyers let free when they destroyed the emails? <CHANTS>
<TRUMP:> Lie after lie after lie. Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to hold public office. <APPLAUSE> <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and really for I guess the making of large amounts of money. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> Today a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills. <AUDIENCE CHANTING>
<TRUMP:> I will say this. The Bernie protestors were much better, more... <APPLAUSE> They were much -- they had much more vim and vigor. <APPLAUSE> These have very, very, very little energy. So you had a phone log today that was released. She was Secretary of State Clinton's chief of staff. You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business. But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the chief operating officer of the Clinton Foundation. No other individual or group appears to have left that many messages. We also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was secretary of State were donors to the Clinton Foundation. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech. I walked through two of them yesterday. The sale of U.S. uranium to Russia and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton a tremendous amount of money for a speech. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> The UBS saga is another one. Shortly after Hillary Clinton became secretary of State, she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans. That's nice. She negotiated a very good deal for UBS, and a very bad deal for law enforcement. Of the 52,000 accounts the U.S. was seeking, the government settled for only 4,450. Her intervention was described by Treasury as ""unusual."" Before her unusual intervention, UBS had donated only $60,000 to the foundation. After the Clinton favor for UBS, it opened its wallet for big bucks. And out came a $600,000 contribution, a $32 million loan, and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> This is corruption. And this is why I have called for a special prosecutor to look into this mess. <APPLAUSE> Justice is supposed to be blind. It's never supposed to be for sale. Hillary Clinton thinks she's above the law. Come November the American people will show her that she is not. We will have a tremendous victory on Nov. 8. We will win and we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> You will be voting for justice, fairness, equality and jobs. We will be working on making our inner cities and African-American people who have suffered so long in these unsafe, horrible places. They will be so proud of what takes place over the next four years if I'm elected president. <APPLAUSE> You will also be voting for a more inclusive country where no one, no one is left out. Another two million Latinas have joined the ranks of those in poverty. No good. Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama. The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent. Our pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda is going to bring back hope to every community in our nation. <APPLAUSE> I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all of those who live in poverty, of which there are tremendous numbers. We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future. She is a disgrace. <APPLAUSE> The era of division is coming to an end. We will create a new future of American unity. Are you ready for real, real, real American change? <APPLAUSE> You'll get it. And it'll be beautiful. <APPLAUSE> It's time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans. We will promote our common culture, values and principles. We will be one nation. We will be one people. We will share together one great future. <APPLAUSE> It's going to be America first again. <APPLAUSE> We will make America proud again. <APPLAUSE> We will make America prosperous again. <APPLAUSE> And we will make America safe again. <APPLAUSE> Friends, citizens and fellow Americans, we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Nov. 8, go out and vote. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. ","The Grammar Lab"

As you know, Florida is my second home, place I love. It's an amazing state and it's filled with so many incredible people. That's why I like it, the people.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> For the next 75 days, we are going to have to work very hard together to win the White House on November 8th. We're going to win. <APPLAUSE> And we just had a great poll come out from Florida University just about a half an hour ago that we're leading by two points in the state of Florida. <APPLAUSE> Our victory on November 8th will be a victory for the people. For the people. It won't be a victory for the pundits. It won't be for the special interests that put up all of that Hillary money. And it won't be for the failed politicians. It will be a victory for you. <APPLAUSE> And maybe most importantly, for your family, for your country. It will be a victory for jobs, jobs, jobs. We're going to bring our companies back. We're going to have jobs back in this country again. We're bringing out jobs back. Manufacturing is down 40 percent. We're bringing our jobs back. And companies aren't going to leave our country so easily. There will be consequences when they do. It won't be so easy for them. But it'll be a victory also for security, for prosperity and it will be a victory for American independence. So important. <APPLAUSE> We will reject the failures of the past and create a new American future where every child -- African-American, Hispanic -- all children can live out their dreams together in peace and in safety. <APPLAUSE> We will bring back our jobs. We will rebuild our depleted military. <APPLAUSE> We love our military. It's been so badly depleted, folks, at a time when we need it just about the most ever. We are going to rebuild our depleted military and no better people than are in our military. But we're going to rebuild it. We're going to take care of our great veterans. They have been left behind. We're going to take care of our great veterans. We're going to unleash American energy. Restore law and order. <APPLAUSE> And we will make government honest once again, which it is not now, believe me. The stakes in this election could not be higher. Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes very substantially and send jobs to other countries. That's what she wants to do. <BOOING> We are going to cut taxes dramatically and bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores. <APPLAUSE> And that is something I look so forward to doing. No one can do jobs like Trump. If you look at Florida, whether it's Doral or whether it's so many of the jobs we have on the beach. We have so many jobs in the state of Florida. And I'll tell you what. Those people love what we've done for them; high wages, great jobs, health care, education. We take care of our people. We have to take care of the people of our country. Believe me, we are not doing that. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton wants to pass more terrible trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She wants to pass it. <BOOING> We are going to stop the TPP, totally renegotiate NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made by mankind, and protect every last American job. We're going to protect your jobs. They're not going to be disappearing from you anymore.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> People in this room 18 years ago were making more money in wages than they're making today. And today, they're working harder and in many cases to a certain extent because of this horrible Obamacare, they're working two jobs. So they're getting older, they're working harder and they are making less. Not going to happen that way, folks. Not going to happen. <APPLAUSE> Of course, I'm working harder also and getting old. That's for sure. Hillary Clinton wants to expand the job killing regulations destroying small businesses in America. Regulations, by the way, are out of control in this country. We're going to cancel every needless job-killing regulation and put a moratorium on new regulations until our economy gets back on its feet. And even then, they're not going to be brought back. They're not going to be brought back. <APPLAUSE> They're not going to be brought back. You know, we need safety. We need a little environmental protection. We want clean air, we want clean water. But what they've done on top of that has been insane. It's killing our businesses and it doesn't allow our businesses to compete with other countries, and you're losing your jobs. We will create great numbers of American jobs beyond anything you've ever witnessed. I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. The greatest. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> And speaking of jobs and speaking of the fact that we're going to do a great job on jobs, evangelicals, people of religion, Christians, Jews, Catholics, Muslims, everybody, you've got to get out and vote on November 8th. <APPLAUSE> And there's only one person you can vote for, Donald Trump. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. We're going to do it <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton wants to put the miners and the steelworkers out of work. You've heard her. <BOOING> You've heard her. We are going to lift restrictions on all American energy and we are going to stand up to foreign cheating -- which is what they're doing, they're cheating -- that threatens steel production in America. They're dumping all over this country because they want our steel to go out of business so they can make this deal for us and charge us plenty. Not going to happen, folks. Not going to happen. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton wants to expand job-killing Obamacare and put government in charge of your health care. You know where that leads. <BOOING> They tried that in Venezuela. You see what's happening? Not working. And many other places, it doesn't work. We are going to repeal -- and this is so important. Are you ready? We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare and create... <APPLAUSE> And by the way, I have to tell you -- always gets one of the most incredible applause -- people are dying with Obamacare. It's a disaster. Your premiums are going up by 40 percent, 50 percent. The number on November 1st -- and they're trying to move the date because it's an election changing number -- is going to be close to 50 percent. It could even be more than that. They want to make it in December. They don't want to reveal the numbers. Obamacare is a disaster. In the great state of Texas, they had almost a 50 percent increase going through Blue Cross Blue Shield -- almost a 50 percent increase, and the people are furious. You're going to have more than that. And folks, it's not going to work. It's dying of its own weight. Regardless of who becomes president, it is dead. She's going to try and save it by raising everybody's taxes. Believe me, we can come up with a plan that will be so much less expensive and so much better. And we will do that.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We will create choice and competition, and that's going to really make it swing. It's going to be an amazing thing to watch. All right. Hillary Clinton wants to trap children in failing schools, 100 percent. I want school choice. Choice. Choice. So you have competition. I want charter schools and I want merit pay for our great teachers. We should have merit pay. Nobody more important than a teacher. We should have merit pay for those teachers that are outstanding. We are going to put our kids onto the ladder of success, and that is a good education and then a great job. That's what we need. <APPLAUSE> This is so important for our inner cities. Our inner cities are suffering like never before. They have been run by Democrats for so many years. In some cases, over 100 years. Almost every inner city is run by the Democrats. Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty. Think of it. Fifty-eight percent of African- American youth are not employed, 58 percent. More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. Not a long time. Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and more than 60 percent in Baltimore. The Democratic Party has run, as I've said, nearly every inner city in this country for 50 or 60 or in some cases over 100 years. Over 100 years. They've produced only more poverty, only more crime, only more joblessness and broken homes all over the place at record levels. To those suffering and hurting and the people left behind, I say vote for Donald Trump. Vote for Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? It cannot get any worse. And believe me, I'm going to fix it. I'm going to make it so good. So to the African-American voter -- great people. To the Hispanic voter who have been absolutely treated terribly, I say, what do you have to lose? What? I will fix it. I'll be able to make sure that when you walk down the street in your inner city or wherever you are, you're not going to be shot. Your child isn't going to be shot. Last night, I brought some incredible families up on stage with me, people that lost their child to illegal immigration, people whose child has been killed, people who have lost children -- devastated, can never be the same -- to people that came into the country illegally. We're going to fix that problem. And we're going to fix our inner cities. And I say to the African-American parents, you have a right to walk down the street of your city without having your child or yourself shot. And that's what's happening right now. That's what's happening. <APPLAUSE> To the Hispanic parents, you have a right to walk outside without being shot. You have a right to good education for your child. You have a right to own your home. You have a right to have a good job. The Democrats and Hillary Clinton policies, once she gets -- if she gets your vote -- and I think we're going to do great with African-Americans and with the Hispanics. But once she gets your votes, you know what she does? Bye-bye, folks. See you in four years. That's what it is. She's going to do nothing. She's going to do nothing. And you know what the truth -- she doesn't have the stamina to do it even if she wanted to, believe me. I'm asking for the honor of your vote so that I can fight for you. That's African-American, that's Hispanics and that's all Americans. We're going to make it better. Much, much better.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Because Hispanic citizens have been suffering under this president, too. Since President Obama came into office, another two million Hispanics have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Two million have joined the ranks of poverty, not of wealth. I want you to join the -- the ranks of people that are making phenomenal livings. That's what you want to join. <APPLAUSE> The number of Hispanic children living in poverty increased by 15 percent in that short period of time. So I'm going to fight to give every Hispanic citizen in this country a much better future, a much better life. And they know it. And they know it. <APPLAUSE> And I don't know if you've seen what's happening, but over the last three weeks, the polls with African-American folks and Spanish- speaking folks, the Hispanics, Latinos, have gone way up. Way up. They've gone way up. Because you know what? African Americans are tired of being used by these phony politicians. Hispanics are tired of being used by these phony politicians. And everybody else in our country is tired of being used by these phony politicians. Believe me. <APPLAUSE> And part of that better future means securing our border to protect the jobs of all of the people living here today. And that includes African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and all Americans. We're going to protect your jobs. We're going to also bring safety, but we're going to protect your jobs because your jobs are not being protected. Hillary Clinton wants to have a totally open border where people can just pour in and take your job and lots of other things happen. <BOOING> We are going to enforce our laws, remove people who overstay their visas, dismantle the gangs and cartels and protect jobs and benefits for hard-working American citizens. <APPLAUSE> And many of them are African-American, by the way, and many of them are Hispanic. We're going to protect your jobs. That includes protecting the jobs and wages of the Hispanic citizens that and living right here in Florida. So many living right here in Florida. And this is their number one complaint because they don't know if the next day they're going to have a job because of people flowing in illegally into the state and into the country. They deserve to have their jobs protected from illegal immigration and broken visa programs. And they are broken. All Americans from all backgrounds have a right to have their jobs protected in their own country. Hillary Clinton would rather give a job to an illegal immigrant than to an unemployed Hispanic citizen, an unemployed African-American citizen or even to a veteran. Believe me. <BOOING> It's going to be America first from now on. America first. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. At the core of our America first agenda are three words, so important. These are so important. They solve so many problems. Are you ready?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> Jobs, jobs, jobs. <APPLAUSE> That's why at the center of my economic plan is a tax cut for small businesses down to 15 percent from 35 percent. <APPLAUSE> Business will flourish. Jobs will pour into our country and new ones will be created. And I mean created all across the land. We're going to create jobs. Thirty-five percent -- we're one of the highest taxed nations in the world, if not the highest. And we're going to be one of the lower taxed nations in the world.
<TRUMP:> There are over 600,000 Hispanic-owned businesses here in Florida. Hillary Clinton's plan would smother them with new regulations, drive up their electricity bills and then raise their taxes to as much as almost 50 percent higher than they're paying now. Family-owned businesses would take a second hit with a 45 percent death tax so that you have a business, you want to leave that business to your children, you've been paying taxes all your life on that business and now the children have to pay so much that normally they have to either sell the business or close it up. It's not a fair tax. More in Florida than anywhere else because you have so many family businesses that cannot afford to pay a death tax. A Trump administration will be a true friend to small businesses and to all working Americans, that I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> That means bringing down taxes, bringing down the price of energy and bringing down job-killing regulations that cost our economy as much as $2 trillion a year -- $2 trillion a year, remember, $2 trillion. Does anyone know what a trillion dollars is? We've got two of them. We're also going to dramatically simplify our very, very complex tax code. <APPLAUSE> H&amp;R Block will be voting against Donald Trump, that I can tell you. Our current -- and you understand that. Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste nine billion hours he year in tax code compliance. That will end under a Trump administration. Hillary Clinton wants to make taxes even more complicated and will raise taxes by $1.3 trillion on you and everybody else. <BOOING> Her anti-energy regulations will be a tax hike on the poor. Your energy bills are going to go through the roof, folks. According to Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion and reduce incomes by $7,000 a person per year. That means you're making less money in 2030 than you're making right now. We've already done that 18 years ago. Right now as a country, we have no growth. We have no growth. You saw that. A Trump administration will end this war on the American worker and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth and power to our country. <APPLAUSE> According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will very simply increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually. We need that so badly. Add over 500,000 new jobs annually and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next seven years. <APPLAUSE> It will increase federal, state and local tax revenue by almost $6 trillion over four decades, increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years. My energy plan will help put trillions of dollars back into our economy. We'll be able to fix up our military, we'll be able to take care of our vets, we'll be able to help you with your Social Security, which everybody else wants to cut to shreds.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Now, with all of that being said, my all-time favorite subject: trade. How stupid are we to allow this to happen to us? Florida has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, a Hillary Clinton-backed deal, one of the worst transactions ever signed in the history of our country. Probably not as bad as will be proven in the future as this horrible, incompetent Iran deal, but we'll get that -- we'll get to that a little bit later. That's another beauty. Honestly, these people don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they are doing. Florida lost one in five of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton and China -- and he put China into the World Trade Organization, which was also backed by Hillary. Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. So we work hard, we work so hard, but if you don't have the right leadership at the top, you're sort of wasting your time because you're not going to get it done. Think of it. We have a trade deficit -- trade deficit with the world of almost $800 billion dollars. Like Bernie Sanders said, she has terrible, terrible judgment. Got no judgment. Look at what she's got, folks. Take a look at the e-mails. She's got no judgment. The good news is if we win on November 8th, these jobs are coming back. They're all coming back. <APPLAUSE> Here are seven steps to bring back our jobs and create millions of new jobs. Number one; I'm going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks which have yet to be ratified. So important. <APPLAUSE> Number two; I'm going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers so that we make great trade deals with other countries instead of incompetent and bad trade deals. <APPLAUSE> We'll bring our jobs back here instead of having -- it's like a one-way -- it's like a one-way bridge, it all goes out of this country. The only thing that comes into our country is drugs. They pour into the country, the cash pours out. We don't do anything right. We have such bad leadership. I'm going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements that a foreign country is currently using to harm American workers, of which there are many. <APPLAUSE> Because they rightfully think we're run by incompetent people. So I don't blame China, I don't blame Japan and Mexico and these other countries. They're getting away with murder, but if I were them, I'd be trying to do the same thing. I blame our leaders. I want us to be on the winning side. We will be on the winning side if you elect me on November 8th. I promise. <APPLAUSE> I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses. We're being abused. Now, the worst abuser is China. I like China. I've made a lot of money with China. I've done very well with China. They're tenants of mine -- their biggest bank in the world is a tenant -- condos, deals, office buildings, Bank of America buildings, so much. I've done great with China. We can do great with China, too. They have no respect for our country. They have no respect for our leadership. And we don't blame them, we don't blame them. We want to put ourselves in that position very soon. You watch. And they'll like us better than they do now. They don't like us. They're building a massive military fortress in the middle of the South China Sea that they're not allowed to do. They're doing that, and yet, they're ripping us economically. We have tremendous power over China -- economic power -- tremendous. We don't do anything. They build and build and build, and they didn't get environmental impact statements when they decided to rip up the sea. They said -- Sunday night, let's build. Monday morning, they were digging. A little different than our country, wouldn't you say? A little different. A little bit different. Number four; I'm going to tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that horrible agreement signed by Bill Clinton to get a better deal for our workers. And if we don't get the deal that we want, which has to be good and has to make up for all of these years of abuse and lost time, then we will walk away, which is fine.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> I'm going to instruct my treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator, the greatest in the world. Any country that devalues their currency in order to take unfair advantage of the United States and all of its companies who can't compete will face tariffs and taxes to stop the cheating. And when they see that, they will stop the cheating. I don't think our politicians even know what's going on. And they will stop or we're going to take in one hell of a lot of money, I'll tell you that. I'm going to instruct the United States trade representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO, World Trade Organization. China's unfair subsidy and its behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance into the WTO, and I intend to enforce our rules. That's all. Very simple. <APPLAUSE> And they know it's coming. They've called a lot of friends of mine. They know it's coming. They say, ""What do we do? What do we do?"" If China does not stop its illegal activities -- remember this. Our trade deficit with China is approximately $505 billion a year. Think of that, $505 billion. Somebody said, ""Oh, but you'll stop trading with China."" I said, ""Is that good or bad? You tell me."" We have to straighten it out, folks. We can't have deficits of $500 billion. We can't have deficits and we can start making things right here again, and it'll be very nice. <APPLAUSE> And I'm going to use every lawful presidential power to remedy the trade disputes, including the application of tariffs. And I'll tell you, we're going to probably have to at least use them in some cases because they have to understand, we're not playing games any longer, folks. We're not playing games. <APPLAUSE> If we take these steps, jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country. We can use the new money to rebuild our roads, bridges and airports. Manufacturing is also a matter of national security. It's national security. Our manufacturing is being decimated. Decimated. We're not going to have manufacturing. I am so tired of seeing manufacturing buildings that employed thousands and thousands of people being turned into nursing homes. It's fine, but you know what, that's not -- we have to -- we have to -- we have to build. We have to build, we have to manufacture. We need to build, produce and create right here in America. Right here in America. <APPLAUSE> Let me tell you a few more things that we're going to do. We're going to end government corruption. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton ran the State Department like a failed leader in a third-world country. That's what it's run -- it's run like a third- world country. She sold favors and access in exchange for cash. She sold it. She sold favors, she sold access, and wait until you see when it's revealed all of those people. Now, it looks like it's 50 percent of the people that saw her had to make contributions to the Clinton Foundation. Wait until you see ultimately what she did for all of those people. Wait until you see. These are not people that go in, as I said, and talk about, how are you feeling. The people she met with outside of government...
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> The people she met with outside government as secretary of State, so many of these people made contributions. She even deleted 33,000 e-mails to hide evidence of her crimes. It's impossible to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. She then lied about her crime to Congress over and over again. She lied to Congress. I don't know if Congress is going to do anything about it, folks. I'm so sick of looking and seeing and I hear reports, they don't do anything.
<TRUMP:> Congress ought to act. She lied to Congress 100 percent. Everybody agrees, and it takes so long for them to act. By the time they act, you're going to say, ""What was it?"" You won't even remembered what happened. Let Congress act today. Let Congress act immediately. <APPLAUSE> The FBI did not act. I have such respect for the FBI. I am so disappointed. I am so disappointed. I love the FBI. I have such high regard -- high respect for the FBI. How did they let that happen? She was so guilty. She was so guilty. The world is laughing at us, folks. And then you have Bill Clinton meeting with the attorney general in the back of an airplane for 39 minutes. <BOOING> And he said they were talking about golf and their grandkids. Give me a break. And very importantly, Bill Clinton, after all of that and after the beautiful gift he was given, Bill Clinton essentially called the FBI director, James Comey, a liar when he said the FBI director was spouting bull. Can you imagine? Man, they don't realize that they owe the FBI director their political lives for refusing to recommend prosecution for Hillary Clinton's many, many crimes. And then he calls the director a liar. He saved Hillary Clinton from facing justice for her illegal and corrupt actions. They were illegal and they were corrupt, and the FBI saved her. And I would imagine many people within the FBI are extremely embarrassed. Extremely. Remember, Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice and also had to give up his law license -- people forget. Hillary Clinton created an illegal private e-mail server, deliberately, willfully and with total premedication -- premeditation. It could the first way was right, actually. You know, I might like the first way better. <APPLAUSE> Premedication, that's a very. Premedication -- I think I like it. <APPLAUSE> All right, premeditation. I love that. She did so to cover up a vast pay for play scheme. Her actions made our enemies vulnerable to foreign hacking and we are vulnerable. That's what's happened. We've become so vulnerable to foreign hacking and betrayed the security and safety of the United States, our military and all of our people. Her actions are criminal. They're purposeful and they're totally calculated. She knew what she was doing. That's why I call for a special prosecutor to look into this. <APPLAUSE> The problem is, with the administration rigging the system -- it's a rigged system, folks -- to protect her vast criminal behavior, the real jury is going to be the American voter on November 8th. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. She's got -- and honestly folks, she's got nothing going. She's got nothing going. There's nothing there. There's nothing going. There's nothing for you. That's going to be four more years of Obama, four more years of ISIS knocking the hell out of us all over the place and everyone else. <BOOING> Got nothing going. Come November, the American people are going to prove that she is not -- she is not a person worthy of becoming the president of the United States.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We don't want four more years of Obama, and I think she would be worse than Obama. I've been watching so carefully over the past month. Hillary Clinton doesn't do speeches, she doesn't do press conferences. It's been almost 300 days. She doesn't do rallies of any consequence. She doesn't do this kind of stuff. We have all these <inaudible>. She's failed at filling the arenas. If you look at her events, they should show those arenas. They never show our arena is packed, but they should show her arenas that are empty. <APPLAUSE> People don't know where she is. Her supports have really -- her supporters have very little enthusiasm. The only people enthusiastic about her campaign are Hollywood celebrities, in many cases, celebrities that aren't very hot anymore and Wall Street donors, special interests, lobbyists, et cetera that want to control government, not to the benefit of our country, but to the benefit of their wallet. <APPLAUSE> Even her protesters don't have the spirit that Bernie protesters had. We had some protesters last night. We had a massive rally last night and we had some protesters. It's like they raised their hand and people -- they're so nice. The cameras don't even cover her protesters, which is bad. I like it when the camera covers the protesters because then they finally show how many people we have at these things. Her protesters have so little enthusiasm for her and they're so boring that the cameras don't follow them. So it's sad when you think about it <ph>. I like the Bernie protesters better. They had enthusiasm. By the way, a reminder to everyone here, register to vote. You've got to register to vote. We have a movement going on, folks. This is a movement. This is a movement. I'm going to Mississippi in a little while. We have tens of thousands of people. We're only confined by the size -- look at this -- back to the corners. We're only -- we're only confined -- we set a record here today. We always set records. We always do. <APPLAUSE> In four, instances for some reason, we have beaten Elton John's record, who's a great guy. We've beaten Elton John -- and he has pianos, right, I don't have a piano. No piano, but we have beaten four times Elton John's record at arenas. Together, we're going to restore ethics and honesty to our government. We're also going to restore safety to our country. Hillary Clinton -- and maybe this bothers me almost more than anything else because I know bad things are going to happen. Hillary Clinton wants to increase by 550 percent over Obama -- thousands and thousands of Syrian refugees coming into our country. <BOOING> Overall, her plan would bring in 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending countries in her first term. This is at the same time we and Europe and everywhere else is experiencing tremendous problems not only with attacks but with lone wolf attacks. That's sickos that by themselves do tremendous destruction. You look at San Bernardino. You look at wherever. You look at Orlando. You can look anywhere you want. The lone wolf attacker, the sicko -- the sicko -- and we're allowing them in by the tens of thousands. How stupid are we? How stupid are we? And you mark my words, I've been very good at predicting things. Been very, very good. People are writing me letters saying you predicted -- I predict a lot of things. Bad, bad things are going to be happening with these people pouring into our country. Bad things are going to be happening. Bad, bad things. You watch. We're going to build a wall, don't you worry about it. We're going to build a wall. We're going to build the wall and Mexico is going to pay for the wall 100 percent.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And it's going to be a big wall. It's going to be a real wall. It's going to be as beautiful as a wall can be, but it's going to be a wall. And we're going to have protection for tunnels so that people can't tunnel under. We can easily have protection. But we're going to have protection for tunnels. We're going to have a real border. We're going to have a real wall. Mexico is going to pay for it. Mexico, right now -- we have a trade deficit with Mexico of approximately $60 billion a year. Believe me, the wall is peanuts compared to the kind of money they're making with the United States. And speaking of that, and I've said this, we are losing so many jobs to Mexico and other places. There have to be -- there have to be repercussions from this. We cannot allow this to happen. We cannot allow these countries because their leaders are smarter than our leaders, because their negotiators are better, because we have frankly, very, very stupid people representing us. We cannot allow this to continue to happen, whether it's Carrier Air Conditioning or Ford or any other -- I could name hundreds -- hundreds and hundreds of companies, millions and millions of jobs. Millions and millions. We cannot allow this to continue to happen. We won't have a country any longer. I'm going to suspend immigration wherever effective screening cannot take place and I am going to institute a new ideological screening program to keep out people who don't share our values of love and respect. <APPLAUSE> Moving forward, we are going to start promoting American values once again. It's time to put the era of division behind us and to embrace a new American future based on our common values and our principles, our principles. <APPLAUSE> And if people don't like our values and if people don't like our principles, tell them don't come in. <APPLAUSE> I understand that the Wall Street donors and the Washington insiders don't want change. We know why, they're making a fortune. They want things to keep going on exactly as they are. That's why they're throwing so much money to Hillary Clinton. It's the powerful protecting the powerful. I used to do that also, folks. I hate to tell you, it's very easy. I know the business better than anybody. I know this subject better than anybody who's ever run for any office, OK? <APPLAUSE> Sixteen months ago, I was the fair-haired way, and all the sudden, I'm an outsider. It took just a few words -- ""I'm going to run for president."" I became an outsider. <APPLAUSE> It's insiders fighting for insiders, but I'm fighting for you. That's why I'm doing this. <APPLAUSE> I built a great company -- believe me, I didn't need to do this. This is a lot of work, a lot of energy and I'm spending my money, by the way -- a lot of energy. We are -- we are doing well. It's a movement. It's a movement. A real movement. We're going to get it turned around. We're going to stop crime. We're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to straighten out our inner cities. We're going to do a lot of things. And by the way, we are going to save our Second Amendment which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> If in San Bernardino or Orlando or Paris -- where by the way, they have the toughest gun laws in the world. If you had this gentleman right there or this woman right here, right, or that gentleman right there standing there with a gun strapped to his or her side when these animals came in and they started shooting people that had absolutely no protection, it would have been a whole different story, folks.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Would've been a whole different story. And if they had even an inkling, if they thought that guns were in the room, they probably wouldn't have even gone there in the first place, OK? Very simple. So we're going to protect our Second Amendment. So I'm an agent of change, I am. And Hillary Clinton is a total defender of the status quo. I don't think you can be too happy with the status quo. <BOOING> I'm asking for your vote so we can create the new American future. <APPLAUSE> This includes millions of new jobs through lower taxes, less regulation and trade deals that put America first. It includes the appointment of justices to the United States Supreme Court... <APPLAUSE> ... who are going to protect our freedom, and that includes they'll be protecting the Second Amendment. <APPLAUSE> So important, folks. Justices of the Supreme Court. Remember, Justice Scalia, great man. We're going to try and get people of that thought process, that thinking, that intellect. But we already have one, and if she chooses four or five -- it could be as many as five, could be a record in the history of this country of new judicial appointments. If she puts people in that are radical left, you have got yourselves a whole different country. We're going to have a new foreign policy that focuses on defeating ISIS, not nation-building. We've tried the nation building, doesn't work, not going to work, never going to work. Hillary Clinton's reckless policies unleashed ISIS onto the world in the first place. She will never have the judgment or the stamina to fix the problems that she created. She created so many problems. It was just announced in a new poll that people feel the country is less safe today than it was before 9/11. Pretty bad poll, that's pretty bad. With all the money we spent, all the trillions and trillions of dollars that we spent, people feel less safe today than they did then. In the meantime, our country is dying, our infrastructure is sick, our roads are terrible, our bridges are falling. Our schools, you take a look at what's happening there. Our tunnels. Everything is bad. And all of that money was spent. It was spent and wasted by people that didn't have a clue. We're going to change it around, folks. We're going to defeat terrorism and keep the terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> And finally, we're going to create a more inclusive society where no American is left behind. We're going to bring back jobs, opportunity and hope to every community in our nation, every community. Once again, we're going to have a government of, by and for the American people. <APPLAUSE> This is going to be your country, your government and your really great future. It's going to be a great future. The rule of special interests is over, it's gone if I win. If I don't win, it will be worse than ever before, you will see. You will see. But hopefully, you will not get a chance to see because we're going to turn it around. We're going to turn it around and it'll be a beautiful thing.
<AUDIENCE: Vote for Trump (ph)!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. We will bring America together as one country again. We are so divided. We are so terribly divided so many ways. President Obama is a great divider. He doesn't know how to put things together. He doesn't have a clue.
<TRUMP:> We will bring it together as one country, united as Americans in common purpose and common dreams. And that's what it is, it's dreams. We dream of having it right. It will be right. It will be right. We're going to have a driving economy. We're going to have a strong, strong, strong border that people are going to respect. And the drugs are not going to be flowing across like gravy <ph>. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have a powerful military, not a depleted military like we have now. <APPLAUSE> And our vets are part of our military. Our vets are going to be treated incredibly well, as they have to be. They're our great people. We're going to have a peaceful nation, a rising standard of living. This is what I promise you. Let's get out there and win on November 8th. <APPLAUSE> And if we do, if we do, we will make America wealthy again. We have to be wealthy. <APPLAUSE> We have almost $20 trillion in debt. We have to make our country wealthy again. And we will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again -- proud. <APPLAUSE> You won't be embarrassed like you are now, with the Iran deal or when you see $400 million being sent on airplanes to terrorists. Who, by the way, won't use that money for terror; they're gonna put that money in Swiss bank accounts. They've got plenty other money to use for terror. Think of these people. They have a plane arrive with $400 million in cash. All different denominations. They've got it right. $400 million in cash. Nobody could believe it. And it turned out that it was actually for the hostages, despite the lies of Obama. It was for the hostages. <BOOING> He couldn't have been happy when his representatives said it was for the hostages. Couldn't have been happy. You know, it's like Obamacare, if you remember, 28 times, ""Keep your doctor, keep your plan."" Remember? Over and over and over again. And then some Democrats, they actually voted because of that. Over and over he lied and he lied and he lied. Well, he lied about the hostages too. $400 million in cash; he lied about that. We will make America safe again. <APPLAUSE> And we will make America great again for each and every American. <APPLAUSE> You will be so proud of your president. And more importantly, you will be so proud of your country. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you and God bless you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<(JOINED IN PROGRESS)>
<TRUMP:> -- first. Your needs are going to come first. The real divide in this election is not between left and right, but between everyday working people and a corrupt political establishment that works only for itself. <APPLAUSE> This election is a chance for the great majority of decent citizens to end the rule of a small group of special interests and to return that power to the voters or, as we would say, to the people. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton believes only in government of, by and for the powerful. I am promising government of, by and for the people. <APPLAUSE> And this fight, which will be a big one, we are taking on... <APPLAUSE> ... let's just win on November the 8th. <APPLAUSE> That would be the ultimate and that's what we're going to do because in this fight, we're taking on some very entrenched and well financed interests. Money is pouring in to her campaign by the special interests, the lobbyists, the donors, the people that own the companies that are moving your jobs to Mexico and other places. These are the same people who pay Hillary $10,000 a minute for a speech. Not a good deal. <AUDIENCE BOOING> Not a good investment. These special interests are the same people who own the newspapers that cover up her crimes. They're covered up. These are the same Wall Street firms who paid Hillary Clinton a quarter of a million dollars each time she delivered her secret remarks, that nobody knows what she said. They're the same people who paid Bill and Hillary Clinton over $150 million for speeches since Bill left the office. <AUDIENCE BOOING> And who donated countless millions of dollars more to the Clinton Foundation. <AUDIENCE BOOING> But you have the power, with your vote -- and by the way, New Hampshire is a very, very important state in this election; very important. <APPLAUSE> And if I win New Hampshire -- OK, when I win. OK. <APPLAUSE> OK, when I win. Just remember this. This is a promise. New Hampshire is staying right where it is in terms of primary. It's an unbelievable state and an unbelievable tradition. And there's a lot of talk of moving you to the back of the pack. That's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. So, I give you my word, New Hampshire stays right where it is. OK? <APPLAUSE> So you have the power, with your vote, to defeat those special interests and put the people back in charge once more like it's supposed to be. This has been a very historic week in American politics. The voters have always known that our leadership in Washington, D.C. is corrupt, and that the system is very badly rigged -- a word that I believe I used first, that has been copied all over the place. It's badly rigged and it's broken. But this week, the curtain was truly lifted. The corruption was revealed for all to see. The veil was pulled back on a vast criminal enterprise run out of the State Department by Hillary Clinton. <AUDIENCE BOOING> As the Associated Press documented, more than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took as secretary of state with people outside government were Clinton Foundation donors.<AUDIENCE BOOING>
<TRUMP:> Hillary's chief of staff received more messages from the Clinton Foundation's chief operating officer than just about anybody else; 85 donors alone that she met with as secretary gave the foundation $156 million. And I know many of these people. I know many of these people. These are not people that are going up to pay their respects and say, ""Madam Secretary, how are you feeling? Isn't it a beautiful day? The weather is so beautiful."" These are people that want things for their donation. These are people that expect things for their donation. And when you follow it out and you see the people that left her office, you take a look at what those people, those companies, and those countries got, believe me, you will find out it is plenty. On top of that, Bill Clinton's total speaking fees rose 44 percent while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, often raking in money from people who had business or matters before the State Department. Very simple. As I said weeks ago, Hillary Clinton ran the State Department like a personal hedge fund. It's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins. Access and favors were sold for cash. It's called pay for play. Over and over and over, people who donated to the Clinton Foundation, or who gave money to Bill Clinton got favorable treatment from Hillary Clinton's State Department. The examples are too many to name here in full. And I've gone over, I will tell you, I've looked at so many over recent days, but they include the deal to sell 20 percent of United States uranium to Russia. <AUDIENCE BOOING> Or the very favorable treatment given to UBS, big bank giant. It includes -- we're all sick of it. <AUDIENCE BOOING> It includes the exemption of telecom giant Ericsson from government sanctions. It includes efforts to put a foundation donor with no national security experience at all onto a highly sensitive national security panel that he wanted to be on, with access to top secret information. It includes foundation donors getting lucrative contracts in Haiti, all while the people of Haiti suffered horribly and are not, by the way, big fans of the Clintons.
<TRUMP:> But these examples are only the tip of the Clinton corruption iceberg. Hillary Clinton's actions constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise. You know it. The government knows it. And she knows it. She created a private -- she created a private, illegal mail server in order to hide her corrupt dealings. That's all it is, folks. Very simple. She knew what she was doing 100 percent. She did so knowing full well it would put American lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking. And that's what happened. And by the way, people that do two percent of what she did, their lives have been destroyed. But she didn't care, as long as it helped her get away with her crime. No risk to America was too great. It didn't matter to her. And now she's running for president. Then to further cover up her crime, she deleted 33,000 e-mails to keep them out of the hands of the authorities and the American public. As a further element of the criminal coverup, she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her work-related e- mails. We now know this to be one more massive Clinton lie and deception. The FBI found thousands of work-related e-mails she failed to turn over, including the new discovery this week of 15,000 more work-related e-mails she did not disclose. What is being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in American political history. It's Watergate all over again. It's Watergate. And she's being totally protected by our government. Our secretary of state sold her office to corporations and foreign governments, betraying the public trust, putting innocent lives in danger, and then she went to great lengths to hide, delete, destroy and lie about the evidence. Just like her lie that she never sent any material marked ""classified."" Total lie. Lie after lie after lie. This is the corruption we expect to see in a third-world country, but not in the United States of America. Just imagine the damage to our security, to our integrity, to our standing in the world. And believe me, the world is laughing as they watch. If Hillary Clinton is allowed to sell the Oval Office in the same way she sold her office as secretary of state, and she can't help herself. She cannot help herself. We cannot let this happen, can't let it happen. We must vote on November 8th to keep the American government from being sold to the highest bidder.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Vote to save your country. So important. So important. You folks have no idea how important you are in this room and this state. So important. And by the way, folks, if you're looking at the poll numbers, take a look. We're doing very well. They're very well. <APPLAUSE> Very well. So vote to protect your family. Vote for honesty, integrity, and accountability now, as all of these revelations have been discovered -- some this week, many this month. Hillary Clinton has been hiding. She's been hiding. Where is she? Although I hear for the first time in a long time she'll be making some kind of a quick statement tonight, but she's emerging, not to take the responsibility for her unethical and criminal conduct, but instead to make one of the most brazen attempts at distraction in the history of politics. Now, I've not seen what Hillary is going to say, but I've heard about it. And in a sense, I don't want to dignify her statements by dwelling on them too much. But a response is required for the sake of all decent voters that she is trying to smear. The news reports are that Hillary Clinton is going to try and accuse this campaign, and all of you, and the millions of decent Americans at record levels. There has never been anything like this. This is a movement we have. This was set up. This event was set up late last night, and look what happens. Look how many people. <APPLAUSE> It's a movement, folks, like they've never seen before. And going to accuse decent Americans who support this campaign, your campaign, of being racists, which we're not. <AUDIENCE BOOING> It's the oldest play in the Democratic playbook. When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument: You're racist, you're racist, you're racist. They keep saying it. You're racist. It's a tired, disgusting argument. And it's so totally predictable. They're failing so badly. It's the last refuge of the discredited Democrat politician. They keep going back to the same well. 
<TRUMP:> But you know what? The people are becoming very smart. They've heard it too many times before. The well is dry. The well is dry. <APPLAUSE> This is the year the American people, who believe in much better and much more honest politics say the word ""enough,"" ""enough."" <APPLAUSE> This is the year that the people who have been betrayed by Democratic policies, including millions and millions of African American and Hispanic American citizens, reject the politicians who have failed them over and over and over again, for 50 years, for 75 years, without break, for even in some cases 100 straight years. They failed them, and you're going to vote for a change. It's time. <APPLAUSE> As I've discussed for many days now, Democratic politicians have run nearly every inner-city in America for the 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 years. Their policies have produced only more poverty, total joblessness, and failing schools. <APPLAUSE> Every policy Hillary Clinton supports is a policy that has failed and betrayed communities of color in this country. But she doesn't care. She's too busy raking in cash from people and rigging the system and taking the African American vote and the Hispanic vote and saying, ""We're going to do a great job."" And right after the election, it's ""bye-bye, I'll see you in four years."" <APPLAUSE> Nothing happens. Nearly four in 10 African American children live in poverty; 58 percent of African American youth are not working; more than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago this year alone. These are the consequences of Hillary Clinton's policies and the policies of people that think like her. She has brought nothing but pain and heartache and broken promises to your inner cities. On top of that, she wants to raise taxes on African American-owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they're paying now. <BOOING> I am lowering taxes very, very substantially. She is asking for a major tax increase. <APPLAUSE> We should be helping these businesses grow and expand, create jobs. But Hillary Clinton is virtually trying to shut them down. She opposes school choice. <inaudible> education is a disaster. She supports open borders that violate the civil rights of African Americans by giving their jobs to people here unlawfully. She supports trade policies that have closed factories in African American communities and put millions of African Americans and others, all of us, out of work.
<TRUMP:> So many people out of work. She supports radical regulations that puts Americans out of a job, and that raise the price of their So many people out of work. She supports radical regulations that puts Americans out of a job, and that raise the price of their energy bills -- you all see it -- beyond anything that you thought would ever, ever happen. She supports policies on crime that make communities less safe, and that make it harder to raise your children in security and in peace. You see it all the time. The inner cities, parents walking with their beautiful child, and they get shot. They're shot, their child is shot, often killed. Folks, what do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? Donald Trump will fix it. We're going to make it better. We're going to help education. We're going to straighten out crime. We're going to create jobs. We're going to bring our companies back. What the hell do you have to lose? It can't get any worse than what it is right now. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> You know, I said this a few weeks ago and I mean it so deeply in my heart, we will fix it. We will get it fixed. They're never going to do it for you. It's words, it's politicians. You know what I always say about politicians? All talk, no action. They're controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests and their donors. Me, I put up my money. I'm into this thing for a lot of money, I want to tell you. Nobody's going to be calling me and asking for favors. We want to move a company to Mexico, please make sure it happens. Let me tell you, I'm going to make sure just the opposite. I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen. I believe every single parent in this country, and especially in the inner cities, has to right to raise their children in safety. Walk down the street in safety. Not be shot at. This is one of the great civil rights issues of our time. And people don't talk about it that way. This is a civil rights issue. The Democrats have run your inner cities. They're making a fortune for themselves, and they're destroying, they're destroying. Remember this. The people that live there, they are destroying those people. This is actually a civil rights issue. And it's a disgrace, and they should be ashamed of themselves. But Hillary Clinton doesn't want to talk about any of this. She can't defend her record. She's got a horrible record. And, as Bernie Sanders said, she's got very, very bad judgment. She really does. All you have to do is look at what she's done. She doesn't have one single proposal that hasn't been tried and failed. She doesn't have one idea that does anything but destroy jobs for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans in our country. It's going to be a disaster. Her trade deals were a disaster. This will be catastrophic for our country.
<TRUMP:> So what does she do when she can't defend her record? That's right. She lies. She lies. And she smears. And she paints decent Americans, you, as racists. She bullies voters who only want a better future and tries to intimidate them out of voting for a change. I'm for change. She doesn't want change. As I discussed yesterday these are the same tactics, the establishment power is used to try to scare the British people out of voting for change also. It didn't work there, and it's not going to work here. Call me Mr. Brexit. The American people are ready to vote for freedom, opportunity and justice. They are ready to take back control of their own futures. You have to take it back. We will take it back. The movement will take it back together. It's time the Clintons were held accountable for their inappropriate conduct ... <APPLAUSE> Thank you. You can see the feeling in this country. You can see by this, by these outbursts, you can see the anger, the anger at what she got away with but maybe she won't get away with it. But you can see the anger when law enforcement allows her a free pass on something that was so bad. You can see the anger in this room. You can see the anger all over the country. Great, great institutions - the FBI, the Department of Justice - they've taken a hit in our country and throughout the world like nobody ever thought would be possible. Nobody. According to the book ""Game Change,"" Bill Clinton shockingly said about President Barack Obama that a few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee. That's what he said. And we've all seen the cringe-worthy comments from Hillary Clinton which I won't get into here but we know what they are. You've heard them. Here's the central point that I want to get across today. Hillary Clinton isn't just attacking me. She's attacking all of the decent people of all backgrounds - doesn't matter - of all backgrounds - who support this incredible once-in-a-lifetime movement. Never seen anything like it. <APPLAUSE> We can't let that stand. We can't. Voters used to the old game where failed politicians like Hillary who did lose to Barack Obama rather decisively - an election she was supposed to win easily - please don't forget that - where she falsely smears Republicans with the charges of racism and other things.
<TRUMP:> Republicans then always have a tendency to back down and be defensive and look bad. Not Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE> Democrats then continued to push policies that are devastating to communities of color and devastating to lots of other communities. We must break this corrupt cycle. We're going to. And we are going to break it beginning today in New Hampshire. <APPLAUSE> So let me make some very clear statements before this whole country, including all of those many cameras back there. First, on the border. The people of this country who want their laws enforced and respected -- respected by all, and who want their borders secured, are not racists. If you want to have strong borders so that people come into our country, but they come in legally through a legal process, that doesn't make you a racist. It makes you smart. It makes you an American. <APPLAUSE> They're all patriotic Americans. <APPLAUSE> We will build the wall 100 percent and Mexico will be paying for the wall. We will build it 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> I see all this stuff given out over the last three or four days by the media that Trump doesn't want to build the wall. Folks, we are building the wall. OK? <APPLAUSE> And remember this also, I have great respect for Mexico's leaders because frankly they're smarter, tougher and more cunning than ours. But remember this also, Mexico is making an absolute fortune dealing with the United States. Not only on the border, but with trade: a $60 billion trade deficit we have with Mexico. Remember what I say, Mexico will pay for the wall. Remember. <APPLAUSE> These are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs protected, and their country kept safe. It's very simple. They want to have their country kept safe. I will never apologize for pledging to enforce and uphold every single law of the United States. We will uphold those laws for our people. <APPLAUSE> I will never apologize for making it my -- and this is, I will tell you -- for making it my priority, but is it your priority also? I think so. <APPLAUSE> So I will never apologize for making it my priority on immigration to protect American citizens above every other single consideration. We have to protect our people. We've lost sight of that.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We will end illegal immigration and we will restore the constitutional rule of law. It will be restored. <APPLAUSE> Next, on national security, people who speak out against radical Islam and who warn about refugees are not Islamophobes. They're not. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our value as a tolerant society and who want to keep the terrorists' hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> If the choice is between saving lives or appeasing politically correct censors in Washington, D.C., that is the easiest choice you and I will ever have to make. <APPLAUSE> We will always choose saving American lives. <APPLAUSE> We have thousands and thousands of people being brought into our country from the Middle East, from Syria. We don't know where they are or where they're coming from. They don't have paperwork. There's no reliable source that can vet these people. It could be the all- time great Trojan horse. Thousands -- and Hillary Clinton wants to increase that number by 550 percent a year. <BOOING> Not going to happen, folks; not going to happen. Not on my watch, that I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> Now on crime. People who support the police and who want crime reduced and stopped are not prejudiced. They're concerned and loving citizens and parents whose heart breaks every time an innocent child is lost to totally preventable violence. <APPLAUSE> There is no compassion in tolerating crime, and poisonous drug dealing, and the killings all over our streets in so many different cities. I will work to dismantle the criminal gangs and cartels and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and violence and poverty and fear. <APPLAUSE> To Hillary Clinton and her donors and advisers, pushing her to spread smears and her lies about decent people, I have three words. I want you to remember these three words: Shame on you. <APPLAUSE> When you're like the Clintons getting -- think of this one -- getting $69 million in political contributions from Wall Street and big banks -- and I think I got $16,000. You saw that? <LAUGHTER> And I don't know who the poor guy is that gave me the money, because he's not going to get anything for it. 
<TRUMP:> It's easy to look down on the so-called little people, which is the way she views the people of our country. It's easy to ignore the devastation caused by our open borders when you spend all of your time with wealthy donors and Hollywood celebrities who... <AUDIENCE BOOING>
<TRUMP:> It's easy to ignore the heartfelt concerns of communities about radical Islam entering our country when you spend your time hanging out with foreign dictators in their lavish palaces and homes. And it's easy, no doubt, for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to the ravages of crime when she has her own personal armed security force. Now she wants to essentially dismantle our Second Amendment. I think the first thing she should do is call up Washington and immediately request that her great Secret Service agents drop all weapons. Let them walk around with no weapons. And let's see how she feels about that when she wants to take away your guns. But this is how the system is rigged. For decades the American people have demanded that their immigration laws be enforced, and that their jobs be protected from out of control immigration. But the special interests, who only want cheap labor, have stopped it from happening. They've totally stopped it. And they're putting up tremendous amounts of money. For years the American people have worried about letting radical Islam spread within our shores. But the elites, who only want to raise more money for global corporations, ignore the concerns of the American voters. Very simple. For 50 years, people living in our inner cities have suffered under the Democrats failed policy regime. In almost every case it's Democratic rule. But the Democratic politicians, who only want to please media executives and Wall Street donors, do nothing but expand the hurt and the suffering that our inner cities and our country is going through right now. It's time for a new day and a new dawn in America. On November 8 we will end the rule of special interests, and we will begin the rule of the people. I am asking for your vote so that we can break free from the failures of the past and create a new American future. I am asking for your vote so that we can achieve amazing things for the American people.
<TRUMP:> We can be greater than ever before. I am telling you we can be greater than ever before. And African-American citizens and Latino citizens will have the time of their life. Because we are going to create jobs like you've never seen. We're gonna bring our companies back, we're gonna bring our jobs back and we are not going to allow these companies to leave our country, fire all of their workers, make their product and sell it foolishly back into our country with no retribution. Believe me, those days are gone. <APPLAUSE> So I'm asking for the vote of every African-American and Hispanic-American who wants to see for the first time maybe ever a better future and a future that begins with jobs, jobs, jobs and also education, education, education. We are going to bring back great education for our inner cities and for our country. We will fix our disastrous trade deals and stand up to the countries that cheat, of which there are many. We will lower taxes and create millions of new jobs as a result. Companies will come pouring in. We will unleash an American energy revolution. We will eliminate job-killing regulations destroying our businesses. <APPLAUSE> We will repeal and replace the horrible disaster known as Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> We will enforce our immigration laws and we will put rules in place that hire American workers first. And that includes Hispanic workers, and that African-American workers.
<TRUMP:> We will end the era of nation-building. And instead work in partnership with our allies to crush and destroy ISIS. <APPLAUSE> We will keep radical Islamic terrorism out of our country. We will promote the values of tolerance, justice and acceptance. We will steadfastly reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its ugly forms. America will be one nation, united in common. We will have a nation the likes of which this world perhaps has never seen before. <APPLAUSE> We will have dreams, and they'll be common dreams. We will have a purpose. We have no purpose right now. Our citizens will proudly promote our values and our system of government as the best anywhere in the world and they will be proud of it and they will believe it - not just say it - believe it. And we will do so without apology.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Together we will make America prosperous again and wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make, very importantly, safe again. Friends, citizens and fellow Americans, we will make America great again, greater than ever before. Thank you and God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. ","The Grammar Lab"

And he was right, so I want to thank Don and Doug Ericksen -- Senator Doug Ericksen, so I want to thank all of them. Amazing -- they've done an amazing job. We are going to work very hard over the next 70 days, and we're going to win the state, and we're going to win the White House. <APPLAUSE> We are going to take back the White House. <APPLAUSE> You know a Republican would never come to the state of Washington, and you know on television they said, ""I wonder why he's going to the state of Washington,"" because you know what, Republicans aren't winning, but we're going to win it that's why I'm here. <APPLAUSE> That's why I'm here. <APPLAUSE> And this love affair began about three months ago when I came up here, and we set record crowds, two events, massive, massive crowds. And I said, ""Why don't the Republicans win that state? I think we're going to win Washington State,"" so that's <inaudible>. That's why I'm here. That's why I'm here. And I don't know if you saw it, but poll numbers came in today that are phenomenal. We're leading in Florida. We're leading in North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> We're leading on a national basis in some of the polls. Los Angeles Times, we're two or three points up. We're doing really well. Folks, I'll tell you what it's all coming together. And when you see crowds like this, people fully understand why. I will tell you that. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. So, we are going to have a great victory for the people -- people. Remember, for the people. <APPLAUSE> It's going to be a victory for every citizen whose voice has not been heard, and that's a lot of people. <APPLAUSE> It will be a win for the voters, not the pundits, not the journalists... ...not the lobbyists, not the global special interest that take care of these politicians and get whatever they want. And they are the ones that are funding my opponent's campaign -- millions and millions and millions of dollars, and they have total control over crooked Hillary Clinton, believe me. Total control. This is going to be your victory. It's going to be your victory. It's going to be your victory. <APPLAUSE> We're going to create the new American future our children so desperately deserve. <APPLAUSE> In this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the workforce. They've been taken out of -- they are going to return and they're going to return quickly, believe me. <APPLAUSE> Crumbling roads, and bridges, and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves. Our infrastructure is going to hell. Frankly, I hate to say it, our country is going to hell, and we're not going to let it happen. <APPLAUSE> Families trapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity. Government will become lean and mean except -- except it will have a big fat beautiful heart. <APPLAUSE> We will have an effective government, a responsible and honest government for a change. <APPLAUSE> Our border will be protected. Our children will be safe. <APPLAUSE> People don't talk about the inner-cities, but I'm talking about the inner-cities. They don't talk about the inner-cities. The Democrats have taken advantage of African-Americans. They take their vote. They win the election, and then they say, see you in four years. Thanks a lot. Not me. We will rebuild our inner-cities and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens. <APPLAUSE> American values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once again, but to achieve this future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past of which there have been many and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies because they are lies, and I know these people well, believe me. One area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for African-American citizens in the United States. <APPLAUSE> <CROWD CHANTING> Thank you. And thank you to law enforcement and our police. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Millions of African-Americans in this country have succeeded greatly and their contributions to every area of our life and now -- and they have done so much. And now throughout history, we should celebrate and cherish that success. But -- but this includes tremendous, tremendous and amazing achievements in art, science, sports, music, business, et cetera. It includes millions of African- American entrepreneurs, innovators, and the millions of African- American workers in our middle class. But -- but we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner-cities and neighborhoods afflicted by total poverty, drugs, and horrible, horrible violence that we watch every single night. Every single night, you turn on the news and you see the violence and it's horrible. No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies and the policies of Democrats who have run our inner-cities for literally 50, 70, 80, 90, even 100 years. Nobody has been hurt more than African-Americans. <APPLAUSE> There is no better evidence of the fact that Hillary Clinton's immigration policy, which brings in illegal immigrants and -- well, that is a true statement. It brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from our hardworking African-American and Hispanic citizens and they want those jobs. Instead of providing free health care and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world that we have no idea even where they come from, we should rebuild our inner-cities and provide jobs to struggling Americans that have been struggling for years and years. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Tonight I'm asking for the vote of every African- American and Hispanic citizen in this country who wants to see a better future, who wants to see real positive change. <APPLAUSE> The inner-cities of our country have been run by the Democratic machine for so long. These democratic policies, the policies of Hillary Clinton... <CROWD CHANTING> These democratic policies, the policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, broken homes, and rising crime. And it's only getting worse. They don't care about you, remember that. They don't care about you. They want your vote, and they don't care. They have used you for decades and decades and decades, and they will continue to use you. Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty. Think of that. Four in 10 are living in poverty. This includes 45 percent of children under the age of six. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working. Meanwhile, another two million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since 2009 -- not a long time ago. In Detroit, half of all its residents do not work -- half. In Milwaukee, where I just left, almost four in 10 African-American men between the ages of 24 and 54 do not have a job. Here in the state of Washington, 65 percent of Latino children and 60 percent of African-American children live in low income households. Chicago just had the most violent month in 20 years. More than 2,800 people have been shot in Chicago since just the beginning of the year. You look at war-torn countries are safer than living in our inner-cities by a lot. It's not even close. It breaks everybody's heart. We cannot let this violence continue. We can't let it happen. <APPLAUSE> It will and it must be ended. Under a Trump administration, it will indeed end. <APPLAUSE> It will be my priority to work with communities, local police, state police, and federal law enforcement to dismantle the gangs and to liberate our citizens from violence, and poverty, and fear. <APPLAUSE> I will appoint the best judges, and prosecutors, and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission, and so many people want to do that. <APPLAUSE> There is one thing which can no longer be denied. If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same horrible results. Remember that. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary Clinton has been doing this stuff for 35 years and nothing's happened. Just remember, nothing's happened. To those suffering I say, ""What do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump?"" <APPLAUSE> I will fix it. I will fix it. I will fight for you as no one ever has before. They don't fight for you. They don't fight for you. <APPLAUSE> Let me also tell you what you have to gain -- jobs, opportunity, security, safety, great education, and many other things -- many, many other things. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. This means very much and just so much to me. I believe every child in this country in Detroit, in Baltimore, in Chicago has the right to live out their lives in safety and in peace. <APPLAUSE> In the Wall Street Journal today, Heather Mac Donald of Manhattan and the Manhattan Institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime and it is soaring like you've never seen before in our inner-cities. And the responsibility of Democratic politicians for creating this horrible problem -- big article, highly, highly respected person. The article is called ""Black Lives Matter to Donald Trump."" <APPLAUSE> True, true. She writes that, ""Mr. Trump's call to restore law and order recognizes the right of inner-city residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of America now really takes for granted."" Freedom from violence is one of the greatest civil rights of our time, so too is the issue of school choice. What a difference it will make. <APPLAUSE> What a difference it will make. We will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at success. <APPLAUSE> I will not accept and neither will you a future in which children -- and think of this -- children of color, any color in this country are not fully included in the American dream. <APPLAUSE> Our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented aspiring Americans on the sideline, which is happening all of the time. We want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and to the greatness of our country. <APPLAUSE> Remember -- and most people don't know this -- the Republican Party is the -- right, you know what I'm going to say. <APPLAUSE> Right? The Republican Party is the party of Abraham Lincoln. <APPLAUSE> Not bad, not bad. It's also the party of freedom, equality, and opportunity. People have forgotten it so long now it is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow, and the party of opposition. By the way, is there any place better to be than a Trump rally, right, any place? <APPLAUSE> <CROWD CHANTING> Nothing makes me more honored and proud than to be the nominee of Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party, and we're going to do our job. <APPLAUSE> Our Party will fight to bring hope to every forgotten stretch of this country. Once again, we will be one American nation -- one American nation. <APPLAUSE> We will be one united people, and we will have one really great future again, believe me. <APPLAUSE> And a great future will be built on these three critical words -- jobs, jobs, jobs. <APPLAUSE> This will include a complete revitalization of our manufacturing sector, which has been absolutely so badly hurt by Hillary Clinton's policies -- so badly hurt, devastated. We're bringing jobs back to our country. We're not going to let people take our jobs anymore. We're not going to let our jobs go to other countries anymore. <APPLAUSE> There will be retribution. There will be a price to pay. <APPLAUSE> We are going to renegotiate the horrible NAFTA trade deal probably the worst deal ever made in terms of trade. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to keep out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a total disaster. And we're going to stand up to China and fight for every last American job. We're not going to be ripped off any longer. <APPLAUSE> <CROWD CHANTING> Thank you. The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved. It is a disaster -- a disaster for our country, a disaster for our workers. We won't let it happen. We cannot let it happen. <APPLAUSE> These are very, very quiet protesters, I will say. <LAUGHTER> I will say one thing, when Bernie Sanders had his protesters out, they had a lot more energy. They really do. <APPLAUSE> Much better, they were much better. They felt it a little bit deeper in the heart. But that's just the beginning of what we're going to do for the American worker. On taxes, we're going to provide massive tax relief to all working people and lower the tax rate... <APPLAUSE> ...on small business from 35 percent to 15 percent. Low and middle income parents will also be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes -- a very important thing. <APPLAUSE> On horrible, horrible regulations which are taking over our country, I am going to direct every agency and department head in my government to identify all needless and job-killing regulations and they will be removed. <APPLAUSE> We will have a temporary moratorium on new regulations to allow our economy to grow. I mean, our economy is a disaster to allow our economy to grow. Economic growth for last quarter has been revised downward to 1.1 percent, a number that you can't even imagine. Just so you know, if China goes to seven or eight percent, it's almost like a national catastrophe. And what they do is they devalue their currency. They do lots of other things and they suck more blood out of our country, and we allow them to do it, folks. And they get back on track, and we keep going down. Not any longer. And believe me, we have the cards. They don't. We have the cards. <APPLAUSE> We have all the cards. Meanwhile, our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion. Think of that. Almost $800 billion trade deficit for the year. You really say to yourself, who negotiates these deals? I know, I know, political hacks and politicians negotiate them. No longer. <APPLAUSE> We will further bring back our jobs by unleashing an American energy revolution, lifting restrictions on oil, and coal, and natural gas, and all sources of American energy. <APPLAUSE> This will create millions of jobs and lower the price of energy and your electric bill and every other bill for the American household. We're also going to secure our border and stop the drugs from pouring in and destroying our country. <APPLAUSE> And I'll be talking about that tomorrow night in Arizona, big speech on immigration. We'll be talking about that, Arizona tomorrow night. <APPLAUSE> The Seattle area recently experienced the largest number of heroin-related deaths -- think of it -- in 20 years -- the largest number in 20 years. It's getting worse. It's getting horrific. And not only heroin, they have drugs now pouring across the border that most people have never even heard of. We have to stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and poisoning our community. <APPLAUSE> Additionally, we are going to stop the Syrian refugees from entering the United States, and instead build a safe zone overseas. <APPLAUSE> Amazingly, Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country. So, I thought I'd maybe do this if you'd like. You know, we talk about Syrian refugees, we talk about refugees, we talk about some people hate our values, hate our country. And I took something that was a song by Al Wilson, The Snake. Has anybody heard The Snake? <APPLAUSE> Should I do it or not? <APPLAUSE> Are you sure? Yes? All right. So this really has to do with people coming into our country that can't be properly vetted. We have no idea where they're coming from. There's no paper work. You know, our government says you have paper work. There's no paper work. And I believe in safe zones and we have to help people out, and we have to have other people. You know, we're almost up to $20 trillion in debt, so we have to have other people like the Gulf States <inaudible>. It's called ""other people's money,"" but I believe very much that we have to help and we'll build safe zones over in Syria and we'll help the people. We have to do that. <APPLAUSE> But if you look at what happens on a daily basis in Germany, what she's done to that country is unbelievable. If you look at what's happening in France, it's no longer friends. Friends of mine that used to love to go to Paris, they say we're not going to Paris anymore, it's no longer Paris. You see what's happening in different countries and you see what's happening in our own country whether it's Orlando or whether it's San Bernardino or whether it's any one of many different places. And I read this and I said it's so <inaudible>. It wasn't drawn for that reason, but I said this really represents what it is when we allow people to pull into our country, we don't know who they are, but we know -- we just know bad things are going to happen. It's only a question of when bad, bad things are going to happen. So, I'm going to read this to you. It's called The Snake. <APPLAUSE> And a lot of people like it because it represents the truth. It represents what's going to be happening. This could be the great Trojan Horse of all time. Did you see today where they announced tens of thousands of people coming in, and we have no idea even where they're being relocated? So, on her way to work one morning, down the path, along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. ""Oh, well,"" she cried, ""I'll take you in and I'll take care of you."" ""Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,"" sighed the broken snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk and had laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now she hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in had been revived. ""Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,"" sighed the broken snake. Now she clutched him to her bosom, ""You're so beautiful,"" she cried. ""But if I hadn't brought you in by now you simply would have died."" Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. ""Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,"" sighed the vicious snake. ""I saved you,"" cried the woman, ""and you bit me. Heavens, why? You know, your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die."" ""Oh, shut up, silly woman..."" <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> ...said the reptile with a grin. ""You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in."" <APPLAUSE> Get ready, folks. It's not going to be pretty, going to be a bad deal going on -- bad, bad deal. And I just thought that was very representative of what's going to be happening -- not good. Remember I said, now if on November 8th you go and you vote for Donald Trump for president, you can forget about it because it's not going to happen. We're not taking them in. We're not taking them in. <APPLAUSE> <CROWD CHANTING> Thank you. Thank you very much. Another major issue on this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another, beginning with the support for going into the war in Iraq in the first place, which, by the way, I opposed. <APPLAUSE> Her tenure as secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous such tenure in United States history. She was horrible -- horrible. Look at the world before and after she became secretary of State. Pre Hillary, in early 2009, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Libya was stable. Syria was under control. The group we now know as ISIS was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked by sanctions, right, right? Now, fast forward to the present time after Hillary, here is what it looks like. Iraq is in total chaos. Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens Europe and the United States. ISIS has been unleashed onto the world viciously. Iran, the world's top state-sponsor of terrorism has been put on a pass to nuclear weapons and was given a $400 million cash ransom payment. And that's not to mention the $150 billion that they're getting back. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton -- death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. America deserves a better legacy. <APPLAUSE> All of you deserve a better future and a country that runs so much smarter. <APPLAUSE> I am the change agent. This is a movement. No matter where we go anywhere in this country, we have crowds like this. We have people that love our country. They want to see our country heal. They want to see our country be smart. They want to see our country get better. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton is a defender of the status quo. While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time -- made a lot of money. Bill Clinton speaking fee surged. While Hillary was secretary of State, Bill was paid almost $50 million for speeches during her tenure and increased a 44 percent over the previous years. Then there was all of the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations. It was pure and simple pay-for-play. Just look at what she did with UBS, the big banking concern, or Russian uranium. A disaster relief in Haiti -- Haiti has been a catastrophe, and the money that was spent and the money that was missing -- unbelievable -- and so many other examples. But the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 emails that she deleted. They're gone. <APPLAUSE> <CROWD CHANTING> It's very sad. And not only deleted, folks, this was after -- this was after she was subpoenaed by Congress to produce. And not only that, she bleached with somebody said they never even heard of, in a very expensive fashion, used chemical so that nobody will ever be able to see them. Who does this? Who does this? Hillary Clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her work-related emails. But we now know that is just one more Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she never turned over, and then another 15,000 emails were just discovered a few weeks ago. Now today another 30 emails were discovered by the State Department that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over. These were emails about Benghazi. It just never ends with the Clintons. There's only one way to get justice in this totally rigged system, and it's a rigged system when they did nothing about the crimes that she committed. It's a rigged system. Remember that. <APPLAUSE> The only justice we're going to get is a tremendous victory for everybody in this room and this nation on November 8th -- a big, big vote. <APPLAUSE> <CROWD CHANTING> Thank you. Thank you. In a Trump administration, the State Department will work for the country not for Hillary Clinton's donors and special interest. <APPLAUSE> Under Hillary Clinton, it's the powerful protecting the powerful -- politicians defending politicians, insiders fighting for insiders. I am fighting for you. That I can tell you, I am fighting for you. <APPLAUSE> The government will work for citizens once again. The era of division will be replaced with a future of total unity. We'll love each other as a country again. <APPLAUSE> We're going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common. We will proudly promote our culture as Americans, the best anywhere in the world. It's time to break with the failures of the past and fight for every last child in this country to have a better future and a future that they deserve. <APPLAUSE> So this is the change that I'm promising all of you -- an honest government, a thriving economy, a just society for each and every American, and jobs -- lots of jobs. <APPLAUSE> I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. <APPLAUSE> Together, we will make America wealthy again. <APPLAUSE> Together, we will make America strong again. <APPLAUSE> We will fix our depleted military and we will take care of our vets. <APPLAUSE> We will appoint the proper judges to the United States Supreme Court. <APPLAUSE> We will protect and save our beautiful Second Amendment. <APPLAUSE> We will repeal and replace the horror known as Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. We will make America great again. God bless you. Good night. Thank you. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-09-06"">
<FLYNN: As president -- as the next president what can you do to reform to reform the Veteran's Administration and the health care for our vets? How can we take better care of our vets?>
<TRUMP:> Well, General thank you very much for being here Mike, we really appreciate it. And we really appreciate all of those generals and admirals that today endorsed me. We have...
<FLYNN: Almost 90, yep.>
<TRUMP:> The use of the fighters...
<FLYNN: It's unbelievable.>
<TRUMP:> Almost 90. And these are our fighters, these are our fighting generals and they're actually a lot more to come. But I really appreciate everything from you and all of them. We have great respect for those people. These are great, great people. So if you look at the veteran's situation, I have been so involved over the last year-and-a-half and before that in seeing what's going on with the V.A. And it is a disaster. And I've become so friendly and helped the veterans in so many different ways. But it's such a big problem and we have no clue.
<TRUMP:> Hillary Clinton said everything's working just fine. She doesn't know that people are standing on line for seven days to see a doctor. And dying, Mike. They're dying on line. And we came out with a plan, a 10-point plan and it's on the website and you'll see it if you want. Most of -- I'm sure most of you have already seen it, but it's been really praised by the veterans and the veterans groups. And the fact is the V.A. is a -- the Veterans Administration and waiting and all of the problems and you do have some good doctors in there, but people can't get to see the doctors because the administration -- the bureaucratic workings of the Veterans Administration are a total disaster. And what I've done and what I've looked at -- and you know all about the rate of suicide and all of the problems and numbers that honestly are not even believable when you hear 22 people a day, 22 people a day. These are numbers that you wouldn't even think are believable and a lot of it is because of the fact that they can't get better. They can't -- they have no service whatsoever. And it's been really, really badly handled. One of the things that I've done is we allow when that wait is so long and so horrible -- and sometimes, by the way, a simple procedure or simple prescription, just a very simple thing can make a person's life wonderful health wise. And they can't get to see the doctor -- they can't get to see the doctor. And we have a plan where if you have a wait, you're going to leave, you're going to go across the street or down the road or a few miles away, you're going to see a doctor, a really good doctor, you're going to get taken care of 100 percent or you're going to go and you're going to go to a local hospital, whether it's public or private. You're going to get taken care of and your government is going to pay your bill. And you're going to be all set. It's going to be very good. Every simple. <APPLAUSE>
<FLYNN: That's a promise. That's great.>
<TRUMP:> It should have been done a long time ago.
<FLYNN: And along that line specifically, because you've talked about this with female veterans and I think this is just very, very important because of the size of the -- the scale of the number of females that we now have in our military serving as volunteers. Talk a little bit about what you have described as how you would take care of them.>
<TRUMP:> The female veterans have been like the forgotten people and I think it started because it was -- you know, obviously a while ago, there were far fewer and they haven't increased that capacity and now you have tremendous numbers of female vets and we are going to do procedures that they've never done. And we are going to help the female veteran. They have not been helped. They've really been left behind, even more so than our male veterans. They've been left behind. And it's just not going to happen. We're going to straighten it out. We're going to give them also the right -- if things are not being done right, they're going to have the right to go to a local doctor or physician or a local hospital. And again, whether it's public or private, whichever one is most convenient and whichever one is better frankly, and they're going to get themselves taken care of whether it's male or female, and that's so important. And the other issue that's so important is mental health because the mental health problem is such a massive -- it's such a massive problem in the V.A., and that's something we're going to devote a tremendous amount of time to. And it's not just amount of money. You know, the money they're spending is tremendously -- it's a huge amount of money that they're currently spending. But there are people that are incompetent in the V.A., and they have people that are stealing. You've seen that. If you look at Phoenix and what's gone on in Phoenix where they can't even fire the people, they found people that are stealing and found people that are very dishonest, they can't even get rid of them. All of that's going to change. The V.A. -- you're going to be so proud of what you have. I mean, we're going to take it and you're going to be so proud of what you have, believe me. <APPLAUSE>
<FLYNN: And just to highlight. One of the things that you have talked about is accountability of the people that are serving our veterans in the Veterans Administration and the Veterans Administration system, the whole system. And I think that -- I think for all of us, accountability is probably something not just in the Veterans Administration, but in government as a whole.>
<FLYNN: OK. So we're going to switch topics and little bit and we're going to talk about some of the refugee policies now that we see bubbling underneath us here, coming into this country, some of the challenges that we face. What -- what do you think about Hillary Clinton's current refugee policies? And how do they differ from your own?>
<TRUMP:> Look, she's a disaster in so many different ways, folks. Disaster. <APPLAUSE> I don't even -- I don't really even think she believes in herself. You know, she was brought so far left -- she was brought so far left by Bernie and the group -- and I think we're going to get a lot of the Bernie people because of trade, if you want to know the truth. A lot of the Bernie people are coming with us. <APPLAUSE> Because the one thing he was right about is the fact that our country's being ripped off like never before on these trade deals that are disasters. NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States. <APPLAUSE> It's destroyed our country. And that's one thing he got right. And a lot of people liked him because of trade more so than anything else. But when it comes to immigration, first of all, she thinks that everything is more or less fine. She wants to allow a 650 percent increase over and above what Obama's allowing to come in from Syria and the Middle East. 650 percent. And he's already allowing thousands and thousands of people in. And we don't know where they're coming from. You people know because we're military people -- we don't know where they're coming from. We know -- you see the damage that one person can do, you just have to look anywhere. You see the damage that -- whether it's Orlando or whether it's two people that just got married or they're married and they're, you know, from San Bernardino -- you see in San Bernardino they're getting thrown a party, a shower party or a baby party, and then a short while later they go and they kill 14 people in the group. Look, we've got problems, folks. We have to figure it out. And if we don't figure it out, we have to be careful and vigilant and strong. And she wants to allow a 550 percent increase. You know, I was -- very interesting, I was saying she wants to allow 500 percent more coming in from that region and the press said I was wrong. I said, ""Oh, what's the real number?"" 550. So that time, it was true. <LAUGHTER>
<FLYNN: Right, you were close.>
<TRUMP:> They said the number was too low. But as long as they can prove me wrong, they're happy. But 550 percent increase in people coming from Syria and that part of the world and we can't do it. I want to build safe havens, and we'll have other people build them, by the way. <APPLAUSE> We'll have other people fund them. We'll lead the charge. But, you know, Barack Obama has -- has doubled during his fairly short period of years -- he's doubled our national debt, doubled it. It's going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves. $20 trillion. So, we have to get rid of at least a good portion of that. So we're going to have other people, we're going to have the Gulf states pay for this, because we're going to build safe havens. I mean, look, we all have big hearts. We just can't allow these people into our country until we find out what's going on. We can't do it. We can't do it. Very good. <APPLAUSE>
<FLYNN: And I think that also, as you have said, that they also impact our health care system. They impact all the other costs. So it's very, very important.>
<TRUMP:> By the way you have illegal immigrants -- I hate to say this in this room, because you have a lot of vets in the room. But you have illegal immigrants that she wants and he wants treated better than veterans. You have these people are treated better than people that are in this room. <APPLAUSE> You know it. They are treated better than veterans. And let me tell you, folks, they've got their priorities mixed up. That's going to change so fast, OK? That's going to change.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Good. <APPLAUSE> General, we have a couple of people -- by the way, Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York. What a great man <ph>. Stand up. Stand up, Rudy. <APPLAUSE> Rudy -- whoa. They love him. We love what he did. He took a city that was a disaster, he took New York City and he made it great. Think of it, made it great again, right? He made it great again. So, Rudy, great to be -- to see you. And Eric Trump's wife Laura is here and she's done a fantastic job. <APPLAUSE> Laura has been working very hard, in particular in North Carolina, but helping also with Virginia. We have some people in Virginia, Mike Rabino <ph> and the group. They have done -- they have been amazing and hopefully we can get everybody registered because we have to win. Virginia is a very important state. We have to win Virginia. <APPLAUSE> Thank you.
<TRUMP:> OK. So speaking of disasters, the Iran nuclear deal. And Iran -- Iran has -- I mean, we're talking about putting nukes into the hands of an ayatollah that says death to America, death to Israel and they continue to fire ballistic missiles all the time in violation of this deal. But Iran has engaged in growing hostilities, has increasingly shown it continues to have nuclear ambitions. And as president, what are you going to do about Iran?
<TRUMP:> First of all, if you look at the policies of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, they have created what will be a world power. Not -- you know, they're talking about a regional power. This is going to be a world power. They have become rich, they have become powerful. The deal is one of the worst negotiated deals of any kind that I've ever seen if you look at it, you study it. We gave them $150 billion. How about the $400 million in cash that we gave them flown in -- obviously for hostages. That was the big lie also, just like Obamacare was a big lie. This was a big lie. <APPLAUSE> And 400 -- think of it, $400 million in cash and they kept the hostages. Remember, it had the nothing to do with the hostages but the hostages weren't allowed to leave the airport until such time and then they came. Whoever heard of $400 million in cash, different denominations, different countries, all different money from different countries. Who even has the power to authorize something like this? So what we've done is created a monster. We've created in three years, four years if you look at -- if you take a look at Iran from four, five years ago, they were dying. They had the sanctions, the <inaudible>, they were being choked to death and they were absolutely dying, they weren't even going to be much of a threat, they didn't have anything going and now they're a power. We've made them a power. Overnight we've made them a power. Number one, they're highly threatening to the state of Israel, they are so bad for Israel. Obama has been so bad to Israel. But they're a great threat. And they're a threat to us. And they're going to have nuclear weapons and this path, in my opinion, is going to be a quicker path to nuclear weapons. The deal is grossly incompetent. And then I don't know if you saw the other day we have the little boats going out and they're making all sorts of horrible gestures. They learned the gestures, I guess, they studied the United States and they gave those kind of gestures to our sailors and our captain on the boats and I bet those guys wanted to blow them out of the water. I'll bet you. <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> I'll bet you they wanted to blow them up.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And so you see these four little boats circling, circling, going around, you know, taunting, taunting. It's like they've been emboldened. Here we are, we made a deal that's such a great deal for them and they now feel power. They feel power. Remember the sailors -- the 10 sailors who were a little bit off, they were in the water? So instead of saying, ""Hey, you're in our water, please go over there,"" they humiliated our country, they humiliated those 10 people. And this -- and the only reason we got them back -- of course, you would have gotten them back very fast if I was president, that I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> But the only reason we got them back was the payment the following day was due. A lot of the money the following day was due. And stupid they're not. And they wanted to get that. But just think of what's going on. Here we are, we've made this deal, we just -- we made them a power. And we also happen to have given them Iraq, because Iraq -- you know, I always say Iraq and Iran were very similar militarily and they'd fight, fight, fight. And then they'd rest. They'd fight, fight, fight. And then Saddam Hussein would do the gas and somebody else would do something else and they'd rest. We knocked out the one. And a lot of people don't realize that Iraq has some of the greatest oil reserves anywhere in the world. And so Iran is going to get whatever ISIS already doesn't already have, and probably take that too by the way. What we've done to create a major, major power through really stupid leaders -- stupidity -- is just shocking. It's one of the dumbest deals I've ever seen. John Kerry's a terrible negotiator, but somebody... <APPLAUSE> But don't forget, this was a deal that crooked Hillary Clinton wanted. She wanted this deal. This was a very important deal. And she wanted that deal. And most people don't even get it. You know, normally you understand a deal. You say, ""Yeah, I understand, we get this"" -- we get nothing. We get nothing. This was a deal at the highest level of incompetence. The deal with Iran was at the highest level of incompetence. <APPLAUSE> So we'll -- we'll solve that problem if I get the chance, believe me. And if I get the chance, you'll be very happy -- you'll be very happy. <APPLAUSE>
<FLYNN: So (inaudible) -- and just to remind people, Iran -- just to remind everybody, Iran is still designated by the United States State Department as the leading state sponsor of terrorism, and we've put them on a path to a nuclear weapon. So pretty amazing what we've done. Staying -- staying in the same region -- because this is something that all of us that have served in the armed forces over the last 15 years have been a part of, and that is fighting Al Qaida in Iraq, now fighting ISIS. And ISIS continues to expand their operations. Their -- they have this caliphate that they've established in Syria and parts of Iraq, and they have launched attacks throughout the West. I think it's -- the latest count was somewhere between 22 and 25 countries that they have launched attacks in in the last, you know, probably two to three months. And that has resulted in somewhere between 7,000 to 10,000 casualties around the world. Just a stunning display of capability by ISIS. What -- what is your response to ISIS? What do you believe we should be doing?>
<TRUMP:> Well, first of all, it wouldn't have started if we had proper leadership. Because what happened... <APPLAUSE> We shouldn't have been in Iraq, but we shouldn't have gotten out of Iraq the way we got out, where literally they announced we're going to leave by a certain date. I mean, the enemy couldn't even believe it. Actually, a lot of people thought it was a little bit of a deception, because they couldn't believe anybody would say it. It turned out to be true. And we should have left a small force, relatively small force. As much as I didn't want to be there, we should have left a small force. And really ISIS just evolved out of all of the turmoil, all of the weakness, all of the stupidity of decisions from Hillary Clinton, from Barack Obama.
<TRUMP:> And ISIS started off in a small area and now I read the other day they're in 28 different states or nations. Twenty-eight, think of it. So they're spreading rapidly. A report came out where they were told within the government that they want to try and minimize ISIS and minimize, but the fact is they know it's actually gotten very much out of control. And we have to do something about, we can't allow the chopping off of heads, the drowning of people in steel cages, the viciousness, the violence, we have to knock out ISIS. We have to knock them out good. And we have to get countries that are affected by ISIS. I mean a lot of people say as an example Russia you know Hillary likes to play tough with Russia. Putin looks at her and he laughs. OK? He laughs. <APPLAUSE> Putin -- Putin looks at Hillary Clinton and he smiles. Boy, would he like to see her. That would be easy. Because just look at her decisions. Look how bad her decisions have been. Virtually every decision she's made has been a loser. But wouldn't it be nice -- honestly, because Russia doesn't like ISIS any better than we do. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with Russia and you could knock them out together? Wouldn't that be a good thing? <APPLAUSE> As opposed to, you know, tough talk. She tries to do the tough talk and then she leaves. You know, she goes. I watched it yesterday on the airplane, talking tough about Russia. Then she turned around and sat down, you know. Which by the way, wasn't even played on the national media. Wasn't that incredible? Wasn't even played. So we have to get along with people. We have to get along with certain nations, very importantly. Because it would be awfully good to have Russia and others with us on major attacks on ISIS. <APPLAUSE>
<FLYNN: And to stay on ISIS a little bit, I think this is an important topic and it's certainly one of the national security threats that our country faces today. You have described at times different components of a strategy, military, cyber, financial and ideological. Can you just expand on those four a little bit?>
<TRUMP:> Well, that's it. And you know cyber is becoming so big today. It's becoming something that a number of years ago, a short number of years ago wasn't even a word. And now the cyber is so big. And you know you look at what they're doing with the internet, how they're taking recruiting people through the internet and part of it is the psychology because so many people think they're winning. And you know there's a whole big thing. Even today's psychology where CNN came out with a big poll that big poll came out today that Trump is winning; it's good psychology you know. <APPLAUSE> It's good psychology. I know that for a fact because people that didn't call me yesterday, they're calling me today. So that's the way life works right? But I think we're doing very well. And I really think the State of Virginia; so many different places have been so incredible. So I thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> But cyber has been very, very important. And it's becoming more and more important as you look. And a lot of it does have to do with ideology and psychology and lots of other things. You know we're in a different world today than we were in 20 years ago and 30 years ago. And one of the biggest problems and one of the reasons we have to knock them out is because the weaponry is so powerful today. You know in the old days you could have said, well look they have rifles, we have rifles. We shoot. They have uniforms, we have uniforms. This is a whole different war. The weaponry is so powerful.
<TRUMP:> And we have to beat them over there. We're allowing people to come over here. We're allowing, think of it, you military people. We're allowing people to come over here. And, you know, I used to watch the migration and I'd see people with cell phones. I'd say, ""Where do they get cell phones?"" And some of those people had very horrible things on their cell phones including the ISIS flag. And you say ""What are we doing?"" What are we doing? But we're allowing people to come here and we don't know do they turn on us? Are a small percentage of them bad? Because if a small percentage is bad, that's not acceptable. It's not acceptable. We can't take the risk. Just a small percentage can do such damage, so we can't take the risk. <APPLAUSE> So, General, the bottom line is we have to get very tough and we have to get very smart, or we're not going to have much of a country left, I can tell you that, right now. <APPLAUSE> Good.
<FLYNN: So -- and staying in the -- in the same region of the world, because there's so much going on and it is just unraveling in front of our eyes, and this really has to do with Syria and there's been a bunch of different discussion about what to do with Assad, do you support regime change in Syria?>
<TRUMP:> Look, we have a problem. It's called ISIS. ISIS is fighting Syria. Now we've built up Iran to be a big power. Iran is on the side of Assad, Syria. Russia is on the side of Assad, Syria. So, we built these people up, we build -- we created this -- this strong power in Iran which, seriously, folks, you know better than anybody, four years ago, they were dying, they were gasping for air, and all we had to do was let them sit for a little longer -- in fact double up your sanctions. You wouldn't have had -- you could have really negotiated a deal. How Kerry never left -- that deal was incredible. Everybody knows it was bad. They're dancing on the streets all over Iran and, literally, they're all celebrating, you know, shouting, ""Death to America. Dumb Americans."" What they're saying is incredible. They're saying, ""Death to Israel."" This is in the middle of the negotiation. If I had a negotiation like that I'd say, ""Let's check this negotiation, something's not going very well."" We just kept going right through. He never left the table once. If you would have left that table and said ""I'm sorry, you guys"" -- first of all, we should have gotten our hostages back before we started the negotiation, OK? <APPLAUSE> Hundred percent. And we should have said very nicely, with respect, ""Sorry, folks, until you do it"" -- and then you leave the room because they're going to say ""No, we're not giving your hostage back."" Say ""That's OK, don't worry about it,"" then you get up, you leave. You get back to your plane, you double up the sanctions. They will call you before you arrive back in Washington or wherever you're going, turn the plane around in mid-air, your hostages are coming back. OK? Not $400 million in cash that we have to give. Believe me. <APPLAUSE> And it's 100 percent, it's 100 -- it's not like 99 percent, it's 100 percent. You leave, you say very nicely -- I always tell my -- you know, the story of my father, who was a very good negotiator, he taught me so much. And he'd say -- are you listening to this, Ivanka? But he'd say ""son"" -- he thought I was too tough with things, right? He said ""Son, take the lumps out."" Did you ever hear this story? ""Take the lumps out."" My father, Fred. Said, ""Just nice and easy, nice and easy. Just relax, take the lumps out."" And so, I was thinking -- see, in the old days I would have said, ""We're not giving you anything,"" you know, I would've made the room very angry. Now I just say ""Sorry. We owe $20 trillion. We don't have the money. We can't do it. We can't do it."" <APPLAUSE> <inaudible>. We don't -- by the way. How do we pay them all this? We keep the $150 billion, but with the hostages you say, ""We have to have it back. Look, our people want the hostages; your people don't care."" Their people probably didn't even know -- they did because they played up the hostages because that's a sign of, you know, the big brave Iran.
<TRUMP:> So, what happens is you say, ""We have to have the hostages back."" They will say, ""No."" You leave the room and you double up the sanctions. Within 48 hours, you'll have your hostages back. Believe me. But they didn't do that. Kerry never walked. The only time he walked is when he entered a bicycle race. Can you believe this guy? Seventy-three years old. It's true. <LAUGHTER> He fell off his bicycle and he broke his leg and he was out of the negotiation for three or four weeks. And they probably did better in the negotiation when he wasn't there. That's the only time that he left. He should have left the negotiation and doubled up the sanctions and get what he wanted. That deal is a disaster for us. It's a shorter road to nuclear weapons and it's an incompetently negotiated deal. So these are the things that we're stuck with, folks, but we will fix them.
<FLYNN: All right. And staying in this -- sort of the wider transregion because I -- this is another important aspect because it is a place where members of ISIS now come into Europe, they come into the United States and this really has to do with Libya. So since 2011, with the removal of Gadhafi, Libya has turned into a safe haven for ISIS. It is also one of the -- one of the shipment points for some of these refugees that are leaving coming into Europe and into the United States. What would you do in Libya to defeat ISIS? And just talk a little bit about your commander-in-chief philosophy for how you would deal with this.>
<TRUMP:> Well, it's more of the same. I mean, it's just another place they've taken over. This was a Hillary Clinton deal. We could have done a minor attack. You know, he was begging, he wanted to make a deal, he wanted to do whatever. And this was just -- Gadhafi was so strong on wanting to -- you know, because he knew what was going to happen. But she was unyielding. And frankly, it's a total disaster Libya right now. You know, they have among the finest quality oils anywhere in the world. Their oil is so valuable, so good. And you know who's got a lot of that oil right now? ISIS, ISIS has it. So we knock them out and ISIS now is all over Libya and they've taken over the oil. Remember -- I've been saying this for years, folks, keep the oil. Shouldn't have been there. If you get out, keep the oil. <APPLAUSE> And we should've kept the oil and we didn't. We didn't keep the oil anywhere, we got out. We spent -- I've been saying $2 trillion for years. I know one thing, it's now -- I'm hearing $4 trillion. I mean, you look at what we've spent, $4 trillion to $5 trillion, in the Middle East. And think of it, what do we have? Less than what we had 15 years ago. It's a disaster. It's a total disaster on top of which you have the migration which is destroying Europe. Look at Merkel. I mean, what happened to her the other day in the election is incredible. And I knew that was going to happen. I mean, how could -- what, she's supposed to be popular? Germany is a disaster now. France is a disaster. I have friends -- they love, you know, the city of lights, right? I said to one of my friends the other day, ""So how was Paris this summer?"" He always goes -- he said, ""I don't go there anymore."" He said it's not the same place. It's a totally -- that's not Paris anymore. We're destroying our planet. We're destroying what's going on. We're destroying ourselves. And you look at the election results from Merkel, they were so bad. And people were saying, ""Oh, I think she'll be OK."" I don't think she'll be OK. I was saying -- two weeks ago <ph>, I said, why would she be OK? Millions of people go into Germany. The crime is unbelievable. The problems they're having is unbelievable and Hillary Clinton wants to be the Merkel of the United States, OK? I don't think so. I don't think it's going to happen. I'll tell you what, I don't think it's going to happen.
<FLYNN: I want to -- I want to stay on this issue because this is important. We still have an awful lot of troops deployed in this -- what I would describe as this perpetual state of conflict over in Iraq, in Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere. And I think Americans -- I know American are just -- they're weary of this endless war.>
<FLYNN: So we -- right now, specifically, we have about 5,000 troops in Iraq, and in some cases supporting the Kurds. I think through Hillary Clinton, Secretary Kerry, the Obama administration, over the last eight years, they really have not developed any kind of coherent strategy. What would you do as commander in chief?>
<TRUMP:> Well, first of all, as I predicted years ago, Iran is really controlling Iraq. And they're in there now and they have -- we have just -- you know, they've wanted it -- for decades and decades and decades they've wanted it. And we gave it to them. We gave it to them. Because you had two militaries that were equal. I was saying before, they fight, fight, fight, they rest. They fight, fight, fight, they move 10 feet this way, 10 feet this way, they go home and rest. We've handed it to them on a silver platter. You know, when I say about the deal that we made for them or with them on, you know -- on the whole -- you know, the $150 billion deal, I always said that's one of the best deals I've ever seen. Not really. The best deal is we have given them Iraq, with among the largest and finest oil reserves in the world. We've given that to Iran. We've handed it to them. What we've done is incredible. If we would've -- if our presidents would've just stayed home and gone to the beach, or even gone out and played golf every single day, played two rounds a day... <LAUGHTER> OK, which Obama almost does, but... <APPLAUSE> But I think he's played three -- look, golf is wonderful. I think he's played 300 rounds of golf or something like that -- more than 300. That's more golf than many members of the PGA tour. <LAUGHTER> OK. So look, it's a very serious problem. But honestly, if they would've just done nothing, we would've been in much better shape. Forget about much better shape; it wouldn't even be close. The Middle East now is a total catastrophe, between the migration and all of the problem -- and all of the death. And I'm talking death on both sides, folks. I'm talking death on both sides. Look at the people. You know they blow up a city and they say two people were wounded. All right? You know the real numbers, OK. The real numbers are astronomical, astronomical. And we started this whole thing. And I'll tell you what, we are going to solve the ISIS problem, but we have to also get back -- and we have to solve it big league and strongly and swiftly. But we have to get back to rebuilding our country, because our country is going to Hell. Our infrastructure is a disaster. <APPLAUSE> Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools -- I mean, we go into Afghanistan and build a school. They blow it up. We build it again, they blow it up. We build it a third time, it's still there, barely. And yet if we need a school in Virginia, or we need a school in Brooklyn, New York, or we need a school in Iowa, there's no money. OK, there's no money. What are we doing? What are doing? So, one of those things. <APPLAUSE>
<FLYNN: And -- and I think that the real issue -- and you have hit on this quite a bit -- is how our homeland security and the things that we do here and domestically impact everything we do overseas as well, and I think vice versa. So...>
<TRUMP:> One thing, General, I have to say, the people in our military are amazing. They're amazing. The people. <APPLAUSE> And we don't take care of them properly, because the vets are not being taken care of. And we don't take care of them on the field either, because the equipment is old and tired and, you know.
<TRUMP:> A friend of mine has a son who's been in Iraq for quite a while, you know, going back and forth to different places over the Middle East. And the thing that -- I talked to him -- he's a fine young man and hasn't been wounded badly. I don't think he's been really, you know, very much affected in that way. But he said, the thing that is most discouraging to them over there, soldiers, is when he looks at the other side having better equipment than they do. Because, you know, we give the equipment to people that we think are on our side. And then a bullet's fired and everyone drops their weapons and runs and they come and pick up the weapons. I always talk about the 2,300 Humvees, armor-plated. If our young people would have had those Humvees they wouldn't be walking around without legs and arms right now believe me. <APPLAUSE> Believe me. But they take them. They just take them. So and he said it's so discouraging for our soldiers when they look and they see the quality of equipment that the other side has. ISIS, but the other side has. And they see it's better than what we have, and it's our equipment that they've taken. It's a very, very sad thing. And those kids, they're incredible people. But they really lose their spirit when they see this kind of thing. Believe me.
<FLYNN: So what I want to do is I'm going to jump to the other side of the world now and talk a little bit about North Korea. Because North Korea is probably one of the most belligerent countries on the planet with Kim El Jong (ph). And so North Korea they have grown increasingly belligerent under the Obama-Clinton administration and against them. And they have done just some unbelievable things over there with testing of some of what we believe is their nuclear capability. What do you see just overall as your strategy for North Korea?>
<TRUMP:> Well it's not that they've done some unbelievable things but they're in the process of doing some unbelievable things, believe me. I mean they're very belligerent. They have no respect for our country, none whatsoever. And we have a situation that's a potential catastrophe. We have somebody that truly does have nuclear and nuclear capability. The carrier maybe is not there yet, but it soon will be. We have a man who is I mean he's took over 25 years old I guess or around that, and now it looks like he's getting more and more hostile. And what I would do very simply is say, China this is your baby. This is your problem. You solve the problem. China can solve that problem. And remember this... <APPLAUSE> It's a big problem. China has virtually totally control over North Korea. But they say they don't because they want to tweak us. Look at our president. They wouldn't even give him stairs to come out of Air Force One. <APPLAUSE> OK? All right? And they probably say on that, gee we couldn't get them there, you know? When I saw that yesterday, did everybody see that? Where he couldn't get off the plane? So he had to get off on the kind that drop down. But that's really meant for the crew. And so that when they fix the plane, they go up on those stairs. The whole thing is just, it's insane. You know it's interesting with the president because I saw that yesterday with the stairs. He went to Saudi Arabia and the top people didn't greet him right? He went to Cuba and Castro, the brother, was not there to greet him. And I said to myself, you know if that happened, I'd land, I'd hear he's not there to pay respect to the country, not to him, to pay respect to our country. I would say thank you very much folks, that's OK. Close it up, boom. Let's go back to Washington. <APPLAUSE> I would. I would. Let's go back to Washington. And the scene on the airport tarmac yesterday where this young woman is fighting with these Chinese people, they're saying this is our country, this isn't your country. Wow. Wow. And just so you understand, we are very good to China. And I have great respect for China. I make a lot of money with China. China's great. I don't hold it against them. I hold it against our leaders for allowing this to happen with the trade and the trade deficits.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> The trade deficits are massive. $500 billion trade deficits. I hold it against our leaders. I respect China. I mean, our people should be doing that to them. But it doesn't work out that way. So, you know, nothing against China. I have -- the largest bank in the world is a tenant of mine. I sell condos to people in China. I sold to everybody. But -- but that we allow this to happen, and then we land on Air Force One -- and I was saying, in the history of Air Force One, which is long and distinguished, these are the only three times where incidents like this have taken place. Think of it. Lands in Cuba; doesn't have high officials to greet him. Lands in Saudi Arabia, which we protect -- if we didn't protect Saudi Arabia, they would be gone, OK? They would be gone. But lands in Saudi Arabia, and they don't have the high officials to greet them -- the highest officials. And I said to myself, ""That's probably the only time in the history of Air Force One where it goes into a country, lands, and you don't have the appropriate officials to greet,"" right? I really believe that. And then you're talking about a long history. But then, yesterday, they won't give them stairs to get off the plane.
<FLYNN: OK. So one more, here. And I want to talk a little bit about, in this case -- in this case...>
<TRUMP:> It is hard to believe, yes.
<FLYNN: It is. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. So, I want to talk a little bit about Hillary Clinton and the FBI. Last week, the FBI, on Friday before the three-day weekend, they released notes from Hillary Clinton's e-mail investigation. What do you think that these new revelations say about her qualifications to be commander in chief?>
<TRUMP:> It's such a long answer to that question. <LAUGHTER> It could go on for days. <inaudible> phones, iPhones, whatever they were, and just banging the heck out of them. How about the acid wash of the e-mails that didn't mean anything? How about the 33,000 missing e-mails that were acid washed -- acid washed? And Rudy was telling me, nobody does it because it's such an expensive process. OK, 33,000. Now, these e-mails had to do with the wedding, I give that five... <LAUGHTER> ... the wedding, and the other thing, of course, was the yoga classes, right? <LAUGHTER> Now, look, look, folks, this is a very sad time, I'm telling you, for justice in this country. It's a very sad time. I've never seen anything like it. Never seen anything like it. <APPLAUSE> I mean, go a step further. How about, I guess it was July 4 weekend -- the interview takes place on July 4 weekend with no taping, no tape recorder, no nothing, and right on the weekend, when everyone is, like, away or not watching, and then the information that they wanted was released on Friday before Labor Day weekend, Friday afternoon? Everyone's away. No, no, this is a very sad situation that's going on here. This is a very sad situation. I've never seen it like this. We're like a third world country. We're like a third world country. Never seen anything like it. But on November 8th, we will cure this problem.<APPLAUSE>
<FLYNN: OK. And finally, what I want -- what I want to do is I want to finish on a bit of a high note for this great audience here from Virginia, Virginia Beach, military veterans, spouses, citizens here of this local area. It's a great, great, group of people. (APPLAUSE) Talk a little bit about building our military. What would you do to rebuild our -- the strength of our military?>
<TRUMP:> OK, first of all, it's not like we have a choice, OK? You know, somebody says, ""Oh well, we don't have to spend"" -- we don't -- we're not going to have a country if we don't have -- this is one of the most dangerous times that we've ever had. Some countries are going -- are -- you look at what's going on with the weaponry being produced or bought by some countries, and it's unbelievable. And we're not keeping up. So this isn't like, ""Oh gee, well let's invest it someplace else or let's do this or that."" When we build weapons, we're also employing people, remember that. So this isn't just a one-way street. We're employing a lot of people and when we have fighter jets -- I don't know if you saw the documentaries. About a month ago there was a documentary on the fighter jets. They're so old, that we can't get parts for them anymore, so they go to the plane graveyards and the museums where they have the planes in these museums. And they take parts off the planes in the museums. And then we have our young men and women flying these planes and they were complaining. They said, ""You know, when I came in, our planes were new and great,"" and now they're retiring, they're getting ready to leave -- and some of them would like to stay. But they're getting ready to leave, and they look at, you know, using old parts -- literally from plane graveyards and museums is where they get the parts. This is not the United States that we know, folks. This is not the United States that we want. This is not the United States. <APPLAUSE> So we're going to rebuild our military. We're going to rebuild it with -- with the finest technology in the world, because we have the finest technology. We have the finest technology but we're not paying for it anymore. And frankly, we're paying for too much, and sometimes we're going to companies that are political and we're getting things that aren't as good -- you know this for years -- things that aren't as good as similar equipment that's better for less money. Because they're politically connected, the companies. <APPLAUSE> So, you know, I'm -- I've spent a tremendous amount of money. We're going to announce very soon how much we've raised. We've raised a lot. But I've spent a lot. I've put -- I put more than $60 million into the campaign and... <APPLAUSE> ... and I'm going to be spending a lot more over the next two- month period. Think of it, we're down to 63 days. Hard to believe. Who would've thought -- this started on June -- this started on June 16th last year and now we're down to 63 days. And I must say, with your help, and with everybody's help, we're gonna -- we're gonna do something. We're going to make America great again. You know it's about make America great again, so. <APPLAUSE> So I just want to thank everybody. Really amazing people. And Rudy, I want to thank you very much. And Laura and Ivanka for being here. And of course a truly great general right here, Mike, thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you.

<date:""2016-09-06"">
<D. >
<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> It is great to be back in North Carolina, believe me. <APPLAUSE> We had a fantastic victory in the primaries, and I love the people. And I have property here. I employ a lot of people in North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> And I pay them a lot of money, I want to tell you that right now. So thank you, everybody. It's a really great honor. You know, two people are here tonight. Eric Trump, do we ever hear of Eric Trump, right? <APPLAUSE> His wife, Lara, who was born in North Carolina, and she's running and working so hard to win North Carolina November 8th, November 8th. <APPLAUSE> And I'm sure most of you have never heard of her, but Ivanka Trump, OK? <APPLAUSE> I. 
<TRUMP:> Hi, everyone. Wow, this is amazing. No lack of spirit in this room. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, North Carolina. We are so appreciative for all of you, for the energy, for the enthusiasm. My father is an amazing man. He is a great man. And he will be an unbelievable president. <APPLAUSE> I promise! My father likes to over-deliver, and he will over-deliver for all of you. So thank you, God bless. Thanks, Dad. L. 
<TRUMP:> Hey, y'all! <APPLAUSE> Now, you know I couldn't come home and not say hey to all you nice people here. <APPLAUSE> It's such an honor to represent a family that I can tell you is one of the best families I have ever met in my life. Now, you know I was raised with good Southern values. <APPLAUSE> And I could not be part of and speak on behalf of a family and a man that was anything less than incredible. And that is what our next president, Donald Trump, is. <APPLAUSE> I love, y'all! Thank you, North Carolina! <APPLAUSE> D. 
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Oh, boy. It's great. It's great. We are going to make America so, so, so great again. <APPLAUSE> And in 62 days, we're going to win this state and we're going to win back the White House. <APPLAUSE> But to do that, you must get out and vote. And that means early voting which begins in North Carolina on October 20th. In other words, start voting, start voting. This is our chance to end years of injustice, corruption and betrayal, and we're going to bring back our jobs, by the way. <APPLAUSE> This is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so, so, so many years. Boy, I'll tell you, many, many years of gross incompetence. And that includes bringing back our jobs that have been taken away from us like we're a bunch of babies and moved to other countries that were smarter and sharper than our leaders. That's not going to happy anymore, folks. Not going to happen anymore. <APPLAUSE> For how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests? You know that. This is the year we can fix it. <APPLAUSE> That's because change has come from the outside of our broken system, and it's a very corrupt system at that. We will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place. And that's what you're doing. <APPLAUSE> We need change. We need change. We will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems. So to every American who has been waiting for real change, your wait is over, your moment of liberation is at hand. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! D. >
<TRUMP:> And by the way, we have another room like this outside that's loaded up with people. And outside they have thousands of people also, so that's what's happening. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to go visit the other room right after this. Is that OK with you people? <APPLAUSE> I mean, you already have the better location. We have to go and visit them, right? But a vote for Trump is a vote to restore democracy, to heal our economy and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country. And boy, that does mean North Carolina! <APPLAUSE> The change will begin my first day in office. Number one, we're going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land. <APPLAUSE> Then we're going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our Southern border. <APPLAUSE> In other words, we will build the wall. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! D. >
<TRUMP:> Who's going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico! D. >
<TRUMP:> Who?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico! D. >
<TRUMP:> Exactly right. <APPLAUSE> They will. They will. They will. And you know, they're doing very well. Mexico, honestly, they're doing very well. It's like the eighth wonder of the world, what's going on, massive factories, massive plants are being built. Unfortunately, the bad news is they're being filled up right here, they're being filled up by people from Mexico, not by people from the United States. We've got to change it around folks, I'm sorry, we've got to change it around. And it will change. This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth and many others, many, many others. <APPLAUSE> But that's just the beginning. I'm going to ask Congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace, finally, ""Obamacare."" It's a disaster. <APPLAUSE> Under Senate rules, that bill can be passed with 51 votes; 51, not a big deal, especially if we hold the Senate, and I think we will. Remember, they were saying, well, if Trump wins, well, most of those people are up. But I'm higher than some of them, so it's very interesting. I think we're doing very well, I have to tell you. I think we're doing very well. The pundits are extremely upset... <APPLAUSE> ... meaning a Republican Congress and a Republican president can save Americans from this disaster in a single... <AUDIO GAP> D. 
<TRUMP:> Very simple. And remember the judges, remember the Supreme Court, justices of the Supreme Court, don't ever forget it, don't ever forget it. And don't ever forget the Second Amendment, which is under siege. And you don't vote for Donald Trump, you're going to see what's going to happen, you're going to see what's going to happen to your Second Amendment. It's not going to be pretty. The National Rifle Association, NRA, endorsed me, the earliest endorsement they've ever given, I believe. <APPLAUSE> And you've got to get out. If you believe in the Second Amendment, you've got to get out and you've got to vote. <APPLAUSE> So it's going to be a very busy first day. I'm going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program... <APPLAUSE> ... and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region. And the safe zone will not be paid for by us, it will be paid for by Gulf states that have plenty of money, that don't spend it, because we're going to be, think of it, at $20 trillion, double the amount of debt that we had when President Obama first came to office. So we're not going to build it, but we all have hearts, we want to take care of people, we're going to build beautiful safe zones in Syria. And other people are going to pay for it. It's called the OPM theory of money. I love that theory. It's called other people's money. <APPLAUSE> And remember the power we have, because some of those countries, many of those countries, wouldn't be there for a long period of time, believe me, if we didn't protect them. So we have a lot of power, just remember. We don't use that power, we don't even talk about that power. My opponent wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees over the large number... <BOOING> ... over the large number that are already coming into the country, thousands and thousands, through President Obama. She is running to be America's Angela Merkel. And you see what happened to Angela Merkel of Germany. They had a massive defeat recently in the elections, because Germany has had problems like it's rarely seen before. And look at France and look at other countries. It's catastrophic, folks. It's catastrophic. I have friends that go to France every year, they love it. I say, how did you like it this year? They say we don't go to France anymore, France isn't France. Pretty tough. We'll go to North Carolina instead, OK? I think so. <APPLAUSE> Even our great mayor, Rudy Giuliani, is smiling at that one. But it's true. It happens to be true, Rudy, right? I'm also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous, illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs and many, many more little goodies if they continue to refuse to take back the criminals that have been placed in our country. <APPLAUSE> Right now they refuse to take them back, gang members, drug lords. We bring them back, they say we don't want them, so we fly the plane right back and they go right back into our country. It's unbelievable actually. This is the measure that is called for under current law, and I will totally enforce it. They will take those people back, believe me. <APPLAUSE> The secretary of state is required to take this action. But Hillary Clinton refused to do so, just refused, resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into United States communities. And by the way, lots of crime and even death. Furthermore, I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful, job-killing regulations. And they are going to be removed. This will include lifting the restrictions on American energy. We're going to get your electric bills down. <APPLAUSE> I will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal, totally renegotiate the deal. It's got to be a two-way highway, remember that. Right now it's one way. Our jobs leave our country and go someplace else, mostly to Mexico. And we will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified. That's going to be another NAFTA, believe me. <APPLAUSE> We're going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina. And we're not going to allow our companies to leave North Carolina. There will be consequences if they do so. They're not going to move to a country, make their product, sell it without any tax, without any tariff, right into our country, so we end up with a tremendous loss of taxes and tremendous unemployment. We get nothing. We get nothing. And you know what? If they knew there was retribution, if they knew there was consequence, they wouldn't leave, they wouldn't even be talking about it. They wouldn't even be talking about it. Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA. She supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization. And she supported TPP. Remember, she said it was the gold standard. By the way, I don't think anything can be as bad as NAFTA, but TPP is going to be pretty close. It's going to be a disaster and a disaster for this area. She just does whatever her donors and special interests want her to do. That's why she's raising all this money. But we're raising a lot of money. We're putting out a statement tomorrow. We've raised a lot, and a lot of it, unfortunately, came from me. What am I going to do? But a lot of it came from small donors. I think we're average $61 a shot. And we raised millions. We're going to be reporting a very big number tomorrow, so stay tuned. <APPLAUSE> In a Trump administration, we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers, OK? Not for some other country or some company owned by the special interests and donors that give her money. For the American workers. It's going to be now America first, remember that, and our worker comes first. <APPLAUSE> We will work to ensure that farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets. And that means negotiating fair trade deals that do indeed put America first. Crucially, I am also going to convene my top generals. We have a great one here. Actually, we have a great two generals here tonight. One of them graduated number one in his class from West Point, just like General Douglas MacArthur, General Douglas MacArthur. Where is that general? Where is he, tough guy? He is -- come here, General. Come here. Number one in his class. <APPLAUSE> I'm impressed by that, General. <APPLAUSE> Number one in his class at West Point, two-star general, incredible guy. By the way, did you see? I think it was 88 generals and admirals endorsed Donald Trump today. And these are the fighters, these are the fighters. <APPLAUSE> These are the warriors. These are the ones, not the political hacks that endorsed Hillary Clinton two or three weeks ago. Did you see them all? They run. You know why? Because we have no place for them. These are the people that have been telling her and Obama and others what to do over the last number of years. How has that worked out, folks? How has that worked out? <BOOING> So we're going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction. They will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS. <APPLAUSE> We have no choice. Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission. For years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed, totally failed, foreign policy. And this is a policy that could only happen with incompetent people running our country, believe me. <APPLAUSE> The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia are the same people who are now advising who? Hillary Clinton. Who? You said it. The same people are advising Hillary Clinton. So I'm proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals, active duty military officers and top military experts who know how to win. These are the tough wins, these are the smart ones, and know how to keep us out of this endless war, the war that's been going on forever and draining our country, draining our country. Our infrastructure is a disaster. It is draining our country, our roads, our tunnels, our bridges, our schools, our hospitals, everything. Our infrastructure is a disaster. This is draining us. Hillary Clinton favors what has been called military adventurism, OK? Military adventurism, rushing to invade countries, displacing millions of families and then inviting the refugees into our country, creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups, like ISIS. And believe me, there are plenty of people that are very closely associated with ISIS, coming into our country. We've got it from within, folks. This could be the great Trojan horse of all time. And in 200 years and 400 years, I don't want people to be reading about it. OK? I don't want people to be talking about it. I believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focus on American security and regional stability, instead of using our military to create democracies in countries with no democratic history and couldn't care less about democracy. We're trying to force democracy down their throat. We're spending trillions of dollars and they don't even want it. <APPLAUSE> We will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating radical Islamic terrorism. <APPLAUSE> We will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton and Obama. Her legacy of failure and his total legacy of failure in the Middle East, Russia, Asia, everywhere, has made Americans far less safe probably than ever before. And they talk Russia, they keep talking Russia. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually could get along with Russia? Wouldn't that be nice? Wouldn't that be a good thing? And with Russia helping us, because they don't like ISIS any better than we do, with Russia helping us to knock out ISIS, wouldn't that be a good thing instead of a bad thing? These people. <APPLAUSE> As part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts, we're going to rebuild our very depleted military. <APPLAUSE> And you saw this. There was a documentary recently on our jet fighters. They're so old we can't get parts. We get the parts from airplane graveyards and from airplane museums. We take the parts off planes that are in museums and graveyards and we put them on our jet fighters. This is not the United States of America, folks. This is not the United States. This is our ultimate deterrent, however. We will be guided by three very famous words: Peace through strength. <APPLAUSE> I will ask Congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately reinvest in our military. We have no choice, not like we can say, oh, let's not do it. We have no choice. We have no choice. We have a great country. We want to keep our country strong. We want to keep our country, so we have no choice. Somebody said, isn't there something else you could do? This isn't like, oh, gee, let's pick A, B, C. We have no choice. We have to have, maybe more than ever before, a strong and powerful military. And hopefully, we'll never have to be able to use it. Hopefully, we'll never have to use it. <APPLAUSE> Right now, we have, amazingly, the smallest Air Force since 1947, the smallest Army since 1939, and one of the smallest navies, listen to this, since 1917. <BOOING> Like the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting -- protecting -- our classified secrets. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have by cybersecurity. Big thing, cybersecurity. We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word ""confidential"" or ""classified."" <APPLAUSE> Now, I think she probably understands the meaning. Such a serious situation. And by the way, today, much to the consternation of many, the new CNN poll was just released and Trump is winning. <APPLAUSE> Trump is winning, meaning -- meaning -- you're winning, I'm not winning, you're winning. <APPLAUSE> You're winning. You're winning. The movement is winning, because this is indeed a movement, folks. When you look at this room and you look at another room in this building and you look at thousands of people outside and you learned about it two days ago, this is not just a normal situation. This is a movement. It's a movement. We're tired of incompetent people running our country into the ground. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! D. >
<TRUMP:> The new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office. <APPLAUSE> If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today, just a low-level job, she couldn't even get a security clearance based on what she's done. Her conduct is disqualifying. Let's run through what we discovered in those FBI documents, which, by the way, were released late on Friday just prior to Labor Day weekend, and the interview took place over the July 4th weekend. It's important. And we're hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night to her when he does the town hall, because she is being protected by the media, by the press like nobody ever has been protected in the history of this country. <BOOING> Me, on the other hand, it's a total pile-on. Actually, a couple of the media people have said, also in the history of our country there has been nobody hit so hard, so viciously, so violently, and I will tell you so ridiculously unfairly, as Donald Trump. I'm proud to do it for you, folks. I'm proud to do it. <APPLAUSE> You know the expression, whatever? It's clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information. She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the FBI she didn't understand that the letter C meant confidential or even classified in the documents she e-mailed. On 39 separate occasions, 39, she said she couldn't recall details about her mishandling of classified information and she couldn't even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldn't get into her totally illegal server. <BOOING> Keep in mind that her insecure e-mails included e-mails about the drone program. It's also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered up their actions. After her private server was revealed last March, her staff deleted all the e-mails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery. She bleached her e-mails. Nobody even heard about it before, and nobody does it because it's a very expensive process. Why would anybody that's getting rid of e-mails that had to do with the wedding? And also, wasn't it -- remember, right -- yoga? Yoga. Yoga and the wedding. Why are you, when you delete 33,000 -- I figure five for the wedding and two for the yoga, right? So that's seven. But why do you acid wash or bleach the e-mails? Nobody even heard of it before, very expensive. Just ask yourself. Then they used hammers to destroy phones so they couldn't be turned over. And by the way, who uses 13 different iPhones in four years? Who? The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very, and I mean very shady activity. <APPLAUSE> And now she's running for president. <BOOING> And by the way, did you ever notice, she never talks about policy, she never talks about illegal immigration, she never talks about anything. All she does is a total hit job on Donald Trump. She makes up terms, right? She makes up terms. Temperament -- you know what they did? They got Madison Avenue, that's the big advertising people, and they probably drew, like, 20 terms and they go, oh, let's see, temperament, oh, temperament, yeah, let's use that one. So I have to tell you this, I have to say it, I think my single- greatest asset of any assets I have is my temperament and I know how to win. But it's my temperament, it's my single-greatest asset. <APPLAUSE> And every time you hear it, just remember this is a phony group of lying people. And tell her we want to hear about your policy on jobs, on illegal immigration. I want to hear what she's going to do to stop the jobs from leaving North Carolina and going to Mexico and other places. OK? Let her tell us. <APPLAUSE> Because you know what, folks? She doesn't have a clue, not even a clue. People who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers. They don't. People who have nothing to hide don't bleach -- nobody's ever heard of it -- don't bleach their e-mails or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law. And she got rid of these e-mails after Congress, not before, after Congress requested them. Think of that. Can you imagine if I or somebody else did that? Can you imagine if Rudy Giuliani did that? Oh, Rudy, you'd be in such trouble. Poor, Rudy, right? It's unbelievable. Folks, I'm telling you, in history -- in history -- there has never been a situation like is going on with justice and Hillary Clinton. There has never been a situation like is going on with the media protecting Hillary Clinton. <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! D. >
<TRUMP:> Let's do better than that. Let's win on November 8th, OK. Let's win. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents, then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief of staff declare herself to be Hillary Clinton's private attorney. Hillary and her top aides told the FBI and others related in the lawsuit that they couldn't recall or remember, can't remember anything. By the way, if she really can't remember, she can't be president. She doesn't remember anything! She doesn't even remember whether or not she was instructed on how to use e-mails. Were you instructed on how to use it? I can't remember. But that's in addition to the guy who set up the server. Remember him? And he pleaded the Fifth Amendment. What are we going to do with this guy? What happened? He pleaded the Fifth, right? He pleaded the Fifth. Where is he? Where is he? Is he living? Where is he? He pleaded the Fifth and that was the end, we never heard about him again. Boy, I'll tell you, this is like a third-world country, folks. It's terrible. This is really, if we bring it up, this is like Watergate, only it's worse, because here our foreign enemies were in a position to hack our most sensitive national security secrets. No one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they're trying to cover up massive, massive crimes. Hillary Clinton using, and you know this, she was using State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and to her donors, totally special favors. It's called pay for play. One example of pay for play is what the Clintons did in Haiti. So let me stop here for a second and say how much we appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country. And we've had a great relationship with that community. <APPLAUSE> We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake. But while Haiti has suffered, the Clintons and their pals have totally cashed in. Bill and Hillary's brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company. Clinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments. In one deal, Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company, with a record of violating workers' rights, set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti. The facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft all over the place. People are asking, where did all the money go? This November, it's up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they've raided so many other people and places over the years. <APPLAUSE> One of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clinton's policies are African Americans. She sees them only as votes, not as people worthy of a better future. It's called vote for me now, I'll do lots of things, and then you get the vote, I'll see you in four years, folks. Liar. Many African Americans have succeeded greatly in this country. We honor and protect, we really do, we protect these total achievements. So many have really, they've just succeeded and I have such respect and admiration for that success. But that includes, and I have to say, lowering taxes, because we're going to do things for them, for everyone, lowering taxes on small-business owners to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> We're going to lower taxes on our businesses to keep our jobs. We're going to lower taxes on all businesses so that jobs don't leave our country. But millions of African Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty, joblessness and failing schools. And these are the worst schools you'll ever see. The Democratic Party has run inner cities for 50, 60, 70 and even a hundred years. Forty percent of African-American children live in poverty, including 45 percent of those under the age of 6. Fifty-eight percent of African American youth are not working, they can't get a job. Approximately 2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and nearly 4,000 people have been killed in Chicago since President Obama took office. And that's his home community. Nationwide, think of this, nationwide, African Americans are nearly 60 percent of the murder victims under the age of 22. This is a national crisis. And anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the presidency of the United States. <APPLAUSE> To those African Americans and Hispanics suffering in crime and poverty, I say very simply give Donald Trump a chance. <APPLAUSE> What do you have to lose? We're going to bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, give parents and students school choice. We're going to make your communities safe so you don't get shot when you walk down the street with your child. <APPLAUSE> What do you have to lose? Nothing! I will not let you down. <APPLAUSE> We're going to push a new civil rights agenda. We believe every American has the right to a safe community, a great education and government that protects their jobs, not gives their jobs away to foreign countries. <APPLAUSE> This weekend, I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the great Faith Ministries International. It was an amazing experience. You probably saw it. It was a really incredible experience. I will fight for Detroit. I will fight for Chicago. I will fight for Baltimore and D.C. and, by the way, will I be fighting for North Carolina, that I can tell you... <APPLAUSE> ... and for every part of this nation. And I will fight to bring us all together as one American people. <APPLAUSE> I didn't need to do this. I didn't need to do this. It's not easy. It's nasty. It's nasty. I talk about the fact that people in the audience 18 years ago are making more money 18 years ago than they're making today in real wages. A lot of people, don't raise your hands, but a lot of people, I hear that. Eighteen years ago, they made more money than they make today. And today, they're working two jobs in many cases, also partly because of ""Obamacare,"" but they're working two jobs and they're working harder. Now, as you get older, maybe it would be nice not to work quite as hard. But I can only say this. I've also gotten older and I'm working a hell of a lot harder than I've ever worked before, that I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> True. True. I will fight to bring back our jobs, and that means all those jobs lost right here in North Carolina and every other state in our great union. <APPLAUSE> Let me quote the same passage from the Bible, I read on Saturday, from 1 John 4: No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us, all of us. <APPLAUSE> Made complete in us. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working toward one people, under one God, saluting one flag. <APPLAUSE> It's time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace the new American future. In this future, we will, and we have to, we have no choice, it's just like our military, we have no choice, we have to build it strong again. We have no choice. In our military, we have the greatest people, men and women, on earth. But we have to give them what it takes. We have to back them. And we have to back our police, by the way. We have to back our police. We have to be a country of law and order. <APPLAUSE> And in this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans, and that means great jobs, great schools and great, safe neighborhoods. <APPLAUSE> We will keep our children safe, which requires secure borders, a strong military and supporting law enforcement. Jobs will return, that's right, and the wall will happen. <APPLAUSE> Prosperity will rise, and new factories and plants will come rushing back to our shores. Government corruption will end. And the State Department will answer to the voters, not Hillary Clinton's donors and special interests. <APPLAUSE> So few people remember, but Republicans are the party of Abraham Lincoln. And come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people. <APPLAUSE> You must get out and vote. You must bring all of your friends. You must bring everybody. Get out and vote and be vigilant, watch what's happening, watch what's happening, because we're going to win North Carolina, we're going to win a lot of different places. Watch what happens. <APPLAUSE> Because we're going to take back the White House and we're going to make America proud again. We will make America strong again. We are going to make America safe again. And we will make America great again! Thank you! God bless you! Thank you! <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-09-07"">
<TRUMP:> Wow, thank you, thank you everybody. I know so many people in this room. This is a room I really know the people, there's no question about it. <APPLAUSE> Mike, I just want to thank you. I've known Mike so long and it's -- I knew he -- when he was a young handsome... <LAUGHTER> ... beautiful guy. Now, he's a little older but still handsome, right. But, thank you, Mike, it's a great honor having the Conservative Party. And, just so you understand, we are going to play New York. You know, we're not just doing this for fun. We're going to play New York. <APPLAUSE> And I want to wish the best to Wendy. And, I've watched Wendy over the years and know Wendy and she's a terrific woman and she's going to be fighting hard, and I think she's going to surprise a lot of people. So Wendy, wherever you may be back there -- right there... <APPLAUSE> ... great luck, you're going to do very well. I want to just thank a few people that are here. I assume that we have Carl Paladino somewhere, where's Carl? <APPLAUSE> Carl. John Jay, we have, and Joe from NASA, we have. And we have I think Ed -- I don't know, is Ed here? Ed Cox? Where's Ed? Where's Ed? <APPLAUSE> Where the heck is Ed? Ah, hello, Ed. We're going to play it Ed, okay? We're going to -- we're also going to do those others that you told me about but we won't get ahead. I think we're going to do very well. I think we're going to do very well. We have been, and I have been in love with this state for a long time. And, this is I guess, the first time in a long time, that you really have a competitive person running for president that comes from New York. And, I think we're going to do very well. The polls are looking great. We're playing a lot of states that a lot of people never thought of in terms of a Republican. I don't know, maybe they're just not thinking, I'm as much of a Republican as I think I am. But, states are in play that are never in play for Republicans. And, you probably saw the polls coming in. The recent CNN poll that came out I guess this morning, has us 2 up on Hillary. So... <APPLAUSE> So I'm a long time New Yorker. I've spent billions and billions of dollars in this state and city. I've produced tremendous numbers of jobs, it's been very good to me also. And, we want to win it. We want to win it, and we're going to help New York. We have to help New York because it's got very difficult problems. Taxes are too high by far. You had a lot of great opportunities to reduce taxes. You had a lot great opportunities upstate that weren't taken advantage of. You know what I mean? When I went around, and when New York is so big in the primary, this was the one that was just boom, we won New York. It was -- it was massive. Just about everything. We won just about every location, every place you could be. And, it was an honor. And, I always tell people you know, winning New York by such a landslide against very capable people in the primaries that was an honor for me. Because nobody knows me better than New Yorkers. And I say it's always bad... <APPLAUSE> It's always bad, never good, when you lose your state, and you lose it badly. So, we won it in a landslide and just won every area of it. And, with the help of all of the folks I just mentioned and Carl, and I were just talking, we're going to make a very, very heavy play upstate. We're going to do unbelievably well. I see the ads, I don't know how much money they spent on that ad, but I guarantee you the money would have been better spent doing something else. Because, I don't think a lot of people have signed up. But I'm hearing numbers like hundreds of millions of dollars. I've never seen an ad that's been on so much and so long. But, it's a -- it's an ad nevertheless about bringing your business to New York, right. And, you've all seen it, and I just wonder how much business has been got from that ad. Mike, how much business has been gotten from that ad? Would you rather have the ad money or the business that's been got? He'd take the money. Come here, get over here. <LAUGHTER> This is like old home week. Come here, say something.
<UNKNOWN: It's nice to have the President of the United States from New York but also a Westchester resident. (APPLAUSE) Thank you very much.>
<TRUMP:> Take care of yourself. Nice to see you Rob. Good man, he's going to do very well. He's going to do very, very well. So, over the years I've watched a lot of bad things happen, a lot of good things happen. But I've watched up state, I've watched out on the island, I've watched businesses leave. And, I think one of the reasons I'm standing here instead of somebody else is that frankly, we have really hit a chord with jobs. And, we've also hit it with illegal immigration. Lots of different things, the military. In fact I'm going from here, I'm going over to NBC, we're doing an interview with Matt Lauer, I'm sure that'll be a lot of fun. <LAUGHTER> It will be a lot of fun. It'll be a lot of fun. I'm sure it'll be very fair. <LAUGHTER> And, maybe it will be. Hey, he's a good guy. Maybe, it will be, let's see. We'll let you know, right? But, I just -- you know, it's so sad when I toured the state during the primaries and I got to see every part of the state. I was in Syracuse, and I was in Albany, and I was everywhere. And, I saw those great beautiful buildings that were empty and rotting, and falling down from the wind, and the rain, and the snow. And, they're all over the state. And, there's no hope. There's no hope. Other than if I become president because they will be great then. <APPLAUSE> They will be great. Because, we're going to bring our jobs back to New York. We're going to bring our jobs back to our country. But, we're going to bring our jobs back to New York. What happened is so sad. Those companies have moved to Mexico and other places. But, a lot are moving to Mexico. I tell this to -- I have a friend who builds plants, that's what he does, he builds plants. <Inaudible> building apartment house, maybe he wouldn't know where. But I'll tell you , this is a great guy. I think he's just about the biggest in the world at doing this. And, I say to him, how are you doing, how's business? He said unbelievable. Oh, good, where are you building mostly? Mexico. Oh, that's not so good. That's not so good. Well why? He said Donald what we're doing in Mexico is the 8th wonder of the world. The 8th wonder of the world, think of that. This is a man who builds these massive factories and car plants et cetera. He said it's unbelievable when you see what's happening. I said how are you doing in the United States, where he's from, and where he really would like to be doing the building. He goes, meh, not so good. And, he said but you have to come to Mexico, I just left Mexico by the way. That worked out very well. <APPLAUSE> Very, well. And, I don't blame Mexico for doing what they're doing, I mean I respect Mexico. I have great respect for the leaders and the President was very, very nice. But you know, our businesses -- we're building -- our business is just pouring -- it's just pouring into Mexico and other places. And then China, in a different way they are making our product and they're dumping it all over. You look at what's happening with our steelworkers. You look at what's happening with our miners, and all of the -- it's just incredible what's happening to our country, and we've got to stop it. And we will stop it. By the way, 100% we will stop it. We're not going to let this continue to happen. <APPLAUSE> So... <APPLAUSE> So, I just have to say it's been such an honor to be involved for so long with the Conservative Party, with the Republican Party too. Ed, I couldn't forget you, I would be in trouble if I forgot Ed. But for tonight, the Conservative Party, I have been a supporter -- I've been a supporter of Mike's for a long time. And, we're going to do a great job. You know, it's a little bit like fixing the country, fixing the state. We have to fix it. When I last time -- when I was with the Republicans at the Grand Hyatt, which I built, I told the story of the Wollman Rink, how it was closed for eight years, a total disaster, the city couldn't get it built. They had no clue. They had engineers that came from Miami. You don't want an engineer for an ice skating rink that comes from Miami. <LAUGHTER> And they couldn't make ice. And they'd try, and they had copper tubing and it was going miles, and miles, and miles, and they'd lay it and the next day it would be stolen. And, then they'd lay it, and it would be stolen. This went on for years' right. They'd lay it down, copper was, and is very expensive. And what happened is I went to Koch, Ed Koch, the Mayor of New York. I said Mr. Mayor, my kids are growing up, I want them to be able to ice skate at least once before they're at a point where they don't want to ice skate anymore... <LAUGHTER> ... and I see people sitting in the rink all day long. They had two lunch breaks, one in the morning, one in the afternoon, and there was no work. And, hundreds of people would be sitting in this massive slab. And when they poured the slab, they'd pour it in little chunks. Okay a lot of construction people, because I have a lot of friends here. But they'd pour it in little chunks and then they'd come in the next day, and by the time it was all finished they had chunks all over the place, and it wasn't even. And, it was like this, it was a big level. So, when they put the water on, on one side they had like a foot and a half of water, and the other one they had like an inch. And, they didn't know what they were doing. And, I said to Ed Koch, and it went to the newspapers. I said, you know, because they didn't want to let me do it, they didn't want to be stood up, or they didn't want to be shown up. And, they went -- I went to the newspapers, the editorial board who actually, even though I'm much more successful now they don't treat me nearly as well, I'm trying to figure this out. <LAUGHTER> But they actually did treat me very well, and they said let Trump, do it. And there was a lot of pressure put on and they let me do it. And, I did it in four months. They had spent, I think, probably $20, $21 million. Sometimes I hear $18, I hear $17. Honestly they had no idea what they spent. Whatever it was, they spent a fortune. And, I took it over. And, the first thing I did is I had to get an engineer. So, I fired the guy from Miami because he obviously didn't know what he was doing. And, he recommended actually -- he said why don't you try somebody Mr. Trump from Montreal. I said that's good. And, then I remember I have a friend who was involved with the Montreal Canadians, the ice hockey team. So I called him. I said Edgar, would you do me a favor. Do you have an engineer -- do you have anybody that knows how to make ice? He said oh, I have the greatest guy, and he gave me the name. The guy came to New York, really nice person. And, he said, Mr. Trump, this is terrible. They're using gases, they're using Freon. And, in that pipe, if you have one little pinhole, one little tiny pinhole in miles, and miles of pipe, it'll escape and you can't make the ice. It's a horrible thing. That stuff is meant for refrigerators, not for ice skating rinks. I said that makes sense. You know in the back of the refrigerator right. Not quite, you know 20 miles of stuff. So, he said what you want is brine. I said what's brine? He said well it's basically water with salt in it, so it doesn't freeze. And, you put it in rubber hoses. And you make it very cold, it doesn't freeze, and all of a sudden you have ice. I said boy, that sounds good. So, I thanked him, he drew it up, I went out, I hired some really good contractors. I got rid of all the copper, there was really none left, it was mostly stolen and I put down the rubber hose. Nobody was stealing the rubber hose. <LAUGHTER> Like, nobody stole the rubber hose. It's amazing, rubber hose doesn't have quite the same allure. But it was rubber hose, clamps at each end. Miles, and miles of rubber hose. And we put it down quickly, and beautifully. We got the right machine that froze the water. And, the water went through the rubber hose. And we checked it for leaks. Because, even if it had leaked it wouldn't have mattered that much, unlike the other. But, I said, I don't want it to leak anyway. So before the concrete went down we checked. Then I got a concrete guy who was great, and we had trucks lined up to Harlem. All the way back to Harlem. One continuous pour because that's the only way to do it. One continuous pour. We laid the rebar, and we had these trucks. They poured for 24 hours straight, it's a big surface, massive surface actually. And it was like perfect. We laser finished it. And then, we let it heal, and we poured water over it. Two inches. They said two inches is perfect. And we turned on the machine and low and behold shortly thereafter, there was ice. <LAUGHTER> And, amazing. Amazing. <APPLAUSE> Now it's been a story that's been documented in the Wharton School and the Harvard Business School, and all over. Because it's really -- it's private enterprise. Free enterprise. Private versus government. And there are others. You know, I just did the Ferry point job where this thing was under construction for like 25 years or something, nobody even knows. You know, you ask them how long, and they don't really even know. They have no idea how much they spend. And we got that one open. It's a tremendously big success in the Bronx. But somehow the Wollman Rink, it's just -- it's just a case study. Then we fix up the building which was real easy, and I have it to this day. There's no ice rink in the world that does more business than our ice rink. And it's been tremendously successful and we really, you know, have a good time. And, you know, in a very, very large scale version, we have to do the same for New York State. That's what we have to do. We have to bring back our businesses. We can't let our remaining businesses go. If they go, and they make a product and they want to move to Mexico, and they want to fire all of the employees like they have, in all fairness, been doing, we've very late to the picture. This speech should have been made 15 years ago but I was doing other things. I was one of those companies that was doing well in New York. But, if they want to leave and if they want to make product in a different country and they want to send it over to our borders, and yet fire all our people and not pay taxes and they think they're going to send that over the border. And there's not going to be consequences? Not going to happen. And, once you say look, we hope you enjoy your stay in Mexico, or wherever. It's a beautiful location and you're building a lovely looking plant. But, every time you make your product and you think you're going to send it over, what will be very soon, a very strong border. You will pay a 35 percent tax every single time you send your product over here. <APPLAUSE> Now, I'll tell you, it's very late in the game unfortunately but, this should have been done years ago, and you would have had nobody leave. Because, two things are going to happen. Number one, they're not going to leave, that's about 95 percent. And, then if they do, that's okay too, because we're going to make a fortune. Okay. But, they're not going to leave. And nobody wants to do this because these people and these politicians are all controlled by the special interests that own the companies that want to move to other countries that make lots of money. And, that's the way it is. So, we're going to bring our businesses back. We're going to make sure that they're going to come back into New York, and New York State. I'm tired when I looked out at Suffolk, and different places on Long Island, when I made that tour, I couldn't believe what I saw. I couldn't believe it actually. I've been here all my life, I couldn't believe it. The devastation that has happened in this state, I couldn't believe it. So, we're going to turn things around, we're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to bring back companies and we're going to start a lot of new companies. But not with an ad. We're going to start it by having low taxes and being smart. And, I just want to tell you folks, I'm being 100 percent serious, you know everybody would say, oh don't bother with New York because Republicans don't win New York. I don't think that we're going to be in that position. I think we're going to win New York, I think we're going to do great in New York. <APPLAUSE> Don't forget, Hillary, she's not a New Yorker. And, by the way, in Arkansas, and she's really not from Arkansas either. But in Arkansas, what do I have? A 25 point lead. I think I have a 25 point lead. You know she is from Arkansas, but she's really from Illinois. <LAUGHTER> I'm a real New Yorker folks. I will say this. You will never get more of a New Yorker if you want a President than you're getting with me. <APPLAUSE> So, I want to thank Mike, I want to thank the Conservative Party. I want to thank everybody in this room. I want to thank my son, Eric Trump who has been working, and his wife Lara. <APPLAUSE> And, we have so many supporters. But, I just want to say to you, we are going to play so hard. We are going to play so hard and win. We are going to win this state. It's going to shock people. And, by the way, you know if we win this state, it's over. We win, OK. We win. <APPLAUSE> So, I appreciate the endorsement of Mike, always. I really... <APPLAUSE> ... appreciate being given this great honor by the Conservative Party. And, I will tell you, Mike, get up here for one second, come here. Come here, come here. <APPLAUSE> I want, to thank you a man. <APPLAUSE> We're a hell of a job for this man. Thank you, thank you everybody, thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much everybody. Thank you, thank you Carl.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-09-09"">
<(JOINED IN PROGRESS)>
<TRUMP:> The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose this incredible campaign, this incredible movement, is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change, not partisan change. Not change for the donors. We're fighting for all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, conservatives, liberals. Even liberals who failed us in this corrupt, corrupt, corrupt system. We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice. And I will tell you, the campaign contributions coming in are unbelievable. Small donors, $61 a pop. <APPLAUSE> And I'm spending my money. I am spending a fortune. I am spending a lot. I'm putting up my money. And we're being helped by small donors, and we're setting records. And we have done some job. But I will say if we don't make it -- despite what they say, if we don't make it. They're all saying it doesn't matter. What you've done has never been done before. It's one of the great phenomena. Let me tell you. If we don't make it, it's the greatest waste of time, energy and money that I can ever think of. I will tell you, we don't make it. <APPLAUSE> But we're going to make it. And polls came out today... <APPLAUSE> Polls came out today where we're up in Ohio. We're up in Florida. We're up in North Carolina. Up. <APPLAUSE> We're up nationwide. CNN two days ago, up nationwide. So I just want to tell you folks we're going to get it there. We've been abused long enough. As a country we've been abused long enough. We're also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida and every single pat of America, from Pensacola -- great place -- to Pittsburgh. From Baltimore to Baton Rouge we're fighting for ever last city and every last person in the country, everybody. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton, and you can see that from those e-mails... <BOOING> ... is a very dishonest candidate of the past. <APPLAUSE> Ours is the campaign of the future. In this future we're going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first. And we're going to keep our jobs in our country. <APPLAUSE> We're not going to let them take our jobs anymore, folks. We're not going to let it happen. It's been happening long enough. And the reason they don't do anything about it is because the special interests and the donors control our politicians. And they control Hillary Clinton. And it's never, ever going to happen. Take a look at New York state. When she was a senator from New York state, she campaigned by saying that she was going to bring jobs back to New York state. New York state is a disaster. She got elected, she did nothing. She said see you later in four years. She got elected. Take a look at what happened to New York state. The jobs left. The jobs left. Worse than just about any place in the country. She didn't do a thing. It was all talk and no action. And that's what's going to happen here. She's all talk. She's no action. Believe me, she wouldn't know a job if it stared her in the face. I will be... <APPLAUSE> I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. That I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, is there any place better, safer or more fun to be than at a Trump rally? <APPLAUSE> Having a good time. So all the people who got NAFTA wrong, and by the way, signed by Bill Clinton perhaps the worst trade deals ever made in the history not of the country, in the history of the world. There's never been a deal so bad as NAFTA. It's a one-way highway out of this country for our jobs and for our money. And we're going to renegotiate that one very quickly, let me tell you. <APPLAUSE> And then you look at what's happening with China. And they're trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership now, which will be a total disaster. <BOOING> That Hillary Clinton called the gold standard. Barack Obama wants it. He's pressing it. It will be, and I say this, nothing can be as bad as NAFTA but it's going to be pretty close. So I just want to tell you we're not approving the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Just another catastrophe. <APPLAUSE> Our trade deficit with the world, with the world, all this work, our trade deficit with the world is almost $800 billion a year. You think we have good negotiators?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. That's called cheating. And believe me, I have great relationships with China, done many deals with China, made a fortune with China, have the largest bank in the world, which is from China, as one of my tenants. They're excellent. And they just renewed their lease. I can't believe it. But they just <inaudible>. <LAUGHTER> Sell lots of condos to China. We can do great with China. And I'm not blaming China. I'm blaming our leaders for being so stupid. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> We're going to stop companies...
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> ... from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in Pensacola. <APPLAUSE> But right here in America. <APPLAUSE> The era of economic surrender is over. <APPLAUSE> We will also have a very, very strong border. <APPLAUSE> That stops people and drugs. And those drugs are poisoning our youth and poisoning our people from illegally pouring into our country. And we will build a wall. And Mexico will pay for the wall. <APPLAUSE> We're losing our jobs, folks. We're losing our jobs. And it's all so easy. When a company makes a product and they fire all their people in the United States and they announce they're moving, as an example, to Mexico. We have to let them know there are consequences when they think they're going to sell their product back into our country. Very simple. <APPLAUSE> And when we tell them the consequences are a 35 percent tax to cross a now very strong border, when we become president, and the Border Patrol agent 16,500 endorsed Donald Trump. They've never done that before. Never done it before for a presidential candidate. <APPLAUSE> And when these companies that want to leave and then think they're going to sell their product to us. No problem. Just come across the suckers. You know they call us the suckers. Not going to happen. And let me tell you, when they hear there is a tax to pay to get their product into the country, guess what? They're not going to be leaving, folks, 100 percent. They're never leaving. Right now you're being drained. As you stand here tonight you have companies from this area and from all areas of the country negotiating deals to move out of the United States. Let me tell you something, when I'm president that's not going to happen. So easy. So easy. <APPLAUSE> So easy. And the reason other people don't bring it up, including your wonderful politicians and including your so-called leader, if you can call him a leader... <BOOING> If you can call him a leader. <BOOING> Is that they're controlled by their donors and their special interests. So they don't want it brought up. They'll talk about it, but they're not going to do anything. Me, I'm not controlled, folks. Me, I'm not controlled. <APPLAUSE> We're going to take care of that. We're going to take care of that situation so quickly and you're going to be so happy and you're going to know you're going to have your company here for a long time, believe me. In this new future we are going to raise your wages. You're going to have competition. People are going to be looking for employees. They're going to be looking. Companies -- companies are going to be looking for people to work in that company. Right now you can't get a job. And all our good jobs are gone. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were 16 years ago. Think of it. My tax, trade, energy, immigration, regulation reform which is a huge problem. We'll get your salaries and your wages up, up, up. Remember... <APPLAUSE> Many people 18 years ago in this room were making more money in wage. They were making more money than they're making today. And today they're working two jobs. Now they're getting older and they're working harder. It's supposed to be the other way. So we're going to bring your jobs back. You're going to have your choice and you're going to do very well. And you're going to say November 8th was a very important day... <APPLAUSE> Very important day.","The Grammar Lab"

While Donald Trump has been running for the last four or five weeks of campaign in which he's laying out issue after issue and what he's going to do about it, Hillary Clinton has been running a campaign of hatred and anger and meanness and cruelty. You see her ads on television, it's almost like she's not running. The only person running is Donald Trump and she's telling you to vote against him. She's not telling you any reasons to vote for her. You know why? There's no reason to vote for her. Then she finally -- we always know -- we always know why we didn't like her, didn't we? We always know it, right? We know why we don't like her. Now she's told us why she doesn't like us. Well, Hillary, I wasn't surprised when you said it. Well, in a way, I was. I've always known this about you. I've always known you look down on people. I've always known you thought you're smarter than everyone else. I've always known that you think that they're just a regular American people. They're just a bunch of pawns to be played with while you make millions. I've always known that about Hillary for years. But you know something I never thought you were going to say it. I never thought you were going to say it with a script. You know what she said, she said that Trump supporters, half of them belong in a basket. (AUDIENCE BOOS)>
<UNKNOWN: They're prejudiced. They're bigoted. They're xenophobic. They're homophobic and there's a whole bunch of phobics I don't even understand. I mean, she has some phobics I never heard of. Did she mention claustrophobia? I'm not sure. (LAUGHTER)>
<UNKNOWN: Maybe the claustrophobics are for Trump. Don't worry, we'll get you over your claustrophobia. And then the other half, you know, the other half, they are bigoted fishes, sick, psychotic individuals, the other half are people without options. Poor pathetic people without options. In other words, that's who we are, all of us here. I don't know what basket you're in but I know for sure you're in a bad one. She doesn't like you. She doesn't respect you. She doesn't care about you. All she cares about are the big donors from Wall Street. All she cares about are the hundreds of millions that are flowing into the Clinton Foundation. All she cares about are the tens of millions that were going into her pocket while she was giving speeches and Bill Clinton was giving speeches. That's what she cares about. And what is Donald Trump care about? He cares about creating jobs for you. He cares about (ordering) taxes. He cares about giving you a choice in education. He cares about opening up America as the big energy capital of the world. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: And he cares about overturning ObamaCare. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: And he cares about restoring our military. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: And he supports our police. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: There's a lot more, he's going to tell you about it himself. He'll do it a lot better than I do but he's our chance. We get one chance. We get it on November 8th to get rid of this woman who hates us, who's told us she hates us and to elect a man who cares about you, who loves you and he's only doing this for you, to fight for you against the insiders like Hillary Clinton. The next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Wow, it's a lot of people. Wow. Thank you very much, everybody. I love North Carolina. We're going to have a big victory in North Carolina. In 56 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win back The White House. Believe me. And by the way, we have thousands of people outside trying to get in. Would anybody like to give up their place? Anybody? No. No. Thank you all very much. It's a great honor. To win back The White House, however, you must get out and vote. And remember that this means early voting, which begins on October 20th. So you have to go out, vote, on the 8th. Or early vote starting from October 20th. This is our chance, in my opinion, it's our last chance. I really believe that. It's our last chance to take it back, to fix our rigged system, and to create prosperity for each and every American. True. It's our last chance, folks, this is it. And after that, we have a whole new different country. And you are not going to like it very much. Our vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent's campaign of hate. Hillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions, and no new ideas. True. By contrast, I have been going around the country offering very detailed plans for reform and change. All of these reform plans are available on our website, and they are extensive. But we have no choice, we have no choice. While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable. <AUDIENCE BOOS> I call you hard-working American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all our people. True. Your mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders, you are lawyers, you are very rich people in some cases. You are at the top of your class, you are at the top of your university, you are professors, you are everybody. You are everybody. You're Democrats, you're Independents, you're Republicans. Above all else, you are Americans and you're entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you, and totally defends you and that is what you're going to get if you vote for Donald Trump. Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country. Every American. Whether you vote for me or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House. That, I can promise. Hillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors, and special interests. She talks change but why hasn't she given it in 35 years? For 35 years she's been here, why hasn't she given change, she never will in a million years. He won't do it. <AUDIENCE BOOS> I will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute. But first, let me invite on to the stage some of our wonderful supporters who can tell you themselves what they think of her very horrible statements that she made three days ago. Folks, come on up. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> These are not deplorable people. That, I can tell you. Come on over.
<UNKNOWN: We are honored. My wife and I represent non- deplorable people. I and my wife has been 85 years in public education.>
<UNKNOWN: Combined.>
<UNKNOWN: Combined. As principal, 45 years and also as guidance counselor. We are not racist at all. We don't even fit on that list that she put out.>
<UNKNOWN: And as a black female American, I'd say that let's get out and support Donald Trump.>
<TRUMP:> Come on up. I'll pick at random. Who wants to speak? Come on.
<UNKNOWN: Good evening, everyone. I am probably a lot of things. Deplorable is not one of them, I assure you. So we are going to make America great again and Hillary needs to take a nap. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: Do I look deplorable?>
<UNKNOWN: No.>
<UNKNOWN: What? (CROSSTALK)>
<UNKNOWN: I'm a wife, a mother, I worked full-time and I'm voting for Donald Trump and Mrs. Clinton, you can go home. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you so much.>
<TRUMP:> Come on.
<UNKNOWN: Good evening. I'm a pastor. My wife and I left our home in North -- in Florida with from all of our children to come with the call of God and plant a church in North Carolina. And let me tell you, there's three questions that I believe you can ask to know who is the best choice for America and that's Donald Trump. Number one, what's his position concerning life? Even it is inception and conception when it's most vulnerable. What's his position on the family and the traditional family this nation was built upon? And will he stand strong with this trial? (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: Ladies and gentlemen, we need to pray for and vote for the next president of the United States of America, Donald Trump.>
<TRUMP:> And don't forget, we're going to protect our Second Amendment. We're going to repeal and replace horrible ObamaCare. <APPLAUSE> And never ever forget Supreme Court Justices. Never. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Come on up.
<UNKNOWN: I'm up here because of President Trump -- excuse me, Mr. Trump, our president, yes. But I'm up here just to tell that he gave me a hat. (LAUGHTER)>
<UNKNOWN: How's everybody? (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: After all the horrible things -- that's right. After all the horrible scandals that Hillary Clinton has been involved in and that she has the gall to call us deplorable, it's unbelievable. If you enjoy your Second Amendment rights, you better vote for this man right here. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: It may not make it four more years. USA>
<UNKNOWN: USA. This is why I'm here to bring everybody on the same level that I'm in. I've been divided, I've been separated but I want everybody to know that I'm part of this family. I'm part of the Trump family and I want to make sure he's president and keep on trying, dog (ph), because I'm backing him 100 percent. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Wow. Wow. That's -- isn't that great? And these people are so representative of everybody throughout our country. So I have some thoughts on Clinton's remarks and I'll be sharing them momentarily. But first, I want to tell you what I'm going to do to make America far better than it is right now and you know there's room to make America great again. We've outlined the detailed plan on trade, on immigration. Build a wall. We're going to build a wall. We're going to build a wall. <APPLAUSE> And who is going to pay for the wall? Hundred percent. Hundred percent. They may not know it yet but they're paying for the wall. On rebuilding the military, on changing our foreign policy, I've delivered a plan on defeating Islamic terrorism. On reforming our tax code, on unleashing American energy and on providing school choice to every disadvantage child in America. We've released policy after policy, solution after solution every day. We're putting forward new ideas to make your life better. We need change. We have to have change and it has to happen quickly. We're going in the wrong direction like nobody has ever thought possible. The change will start right away the moment I take my oath of office. Right away. <APPLAUSE> On my first day, we're going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama. <APPLAUSE> Then I'm going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless job-killing regulations will be canceled. <APPLAUSE> Millions of new jobs will come pouring in. We're going to lift restrictions on American energy. This will create another half a million new jobs a year and that's just the beginning. On my first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace, I just said it, ObamaCare. <APPLAUSE> And this will save another two million jobs. It is a disaster. You see what's happening, your premiums are going through the roof. Your deductibles are so high you'll never get to use it hopefully because the only way you'll use it is it has to be a long slow death. You'll never get to use it. I am also going to propose a massive tax cut to unleash prosperity in every city and every state in our country. Big tax code. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> I'm going to instruct the Department of Commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt American manufacturing. You know what's happening to your area. I will use every lawful presidential power to achieve relief for our workers and we're going to protect our workers, not like it's been for a long time now. Our workers are going to come first. We are going to protect our workers. <APPLAUSE> You can read the full seven-point trade plan on my website. But I have to tell you, when it comes to trade, we're going to renegotiate some of those horrible deals and, boy, is NAFTA bad. North Carolina has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Think of that, 4 in 10, 40 percent. Bill Clinton signed it and Hillary Clinton supported it and it's been perhaps the worst trade deal ever signed not only in this country but actually in the history of the world. There's never been a deal like this. It's a one-way street out of the United States and into Mexico and other countries. Not going to be that way anymore, folks. Right here in Asheville, you've lost one in five manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization, another Hillary back disaster. Hillary Clinton owes all of you an apology and I think you'll get that apology right around the same time that she hands over the 33,000 emails that she delivered. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, Hillary destroyed her emails after, think of this, after she received a congressional subpoena and nothing happened. She gets a subpoena and she said destroy them. What's going on? They used a special software that most people, even sophisticated people in that world don't even know about. They bleached them. She even made her 13 different phones disappear and some of them, she hammered with a hammer. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> Explain that one. I've never done that. <APPLAUSE> She obviously had a whole lot to hide including her pay-for-play scandals as secretary of state. Pay-for-play with UBS, with Russian Uranium, with contracts for her friends and her family in Haiti. Nothing is so dangerous to American democracy as when a public official puts their Federal Office up for sale and that's what happened here. That's what happened here. Hillary believes she's above the law but she also believes, and you know this, she really believes that she is above the law and so far she's turned out to be. What happened to our laws? After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country. She said tens of millions of patriotic Americans are a basket of deplorable. How can you be President -- how can you be president for so many people? She talks about people like they're objects, not human beings. She said half of our supporters are irredeemable and not American and describes the other half as having run out of options. What she can't understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through these lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment and frankly soon to be a failed politician. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> The people want change. They want justice and they want a government that puts the American people first. Whether our supporters have lost a job to a factory that moved to another country or whether a captain in the police department or teacher at a local school, they're united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people. Our system, folks, is rigged. It's a word I've been using for a long time and now it's picked up by everybody. They're all using it but our system is rigged. For those who have been hit by hard times, they understand better than anyone that it's Clinton's Wall Street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country, crushed it. Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these working-class Americans. Absolute hatred in her heart. Could we have a doctor, please? A doctor. A doctor, please. Thank you. A doctor. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. It is about 100 degrees in here, folks. Thank you so much. We love our supporters, right? Let's give her a hand. Yes. Get some water, please. Water. Kevin, get some water, please. Take your time. Don't worry. We have all the time, right? <APPLAUSE> That's a great supporter, an unbelievable person, been here for a long time and I just want to thank you. That's right. That's great. Thank you, darling. And whether it was a supporter or not, we're going to take care of him. That's what we're talking about, right? Right? That's what we're talking. And it is pretty hot in here, folks. It's like pretty hot. Hillary looks down on people, all the people, and frankly, these are people that have been so unbelievable for our country. She looks down on the carpenters and the plumbers and the electricians. She looks down on police officers and soldiers and firefighters and everybody supporting our campaign and we have large chunks, we have everybody supporting us, folks, everybody. We have people that have been so successful. We have some that haven't quite been as successful. Let me tell you, we have everybody because everybody knows what a mess our country is in. She looks down on the people who cook your meals, driver your cars and dig the call that power her electricity. What she's done to the minors is unbelievable. Obama and Clinton have destroyed the lives of the minors. That, I can tell you. And the steelworkers our next and you see that coming. She called these Americans every name in the book, racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, she said they were not even American, right? Anybody's xenophobic, I don't think so. I don't think so. Never in history has a major party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter. She was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all Americans. That's what they want. Watching these parents tell their children about Hillary Clinton's attacks. <APPLAUSE> Let me ask you this question, is there any place in America more fun to be than a Trump rally, right? Right? No place. No place. Watching these parents tell their children about Hillary's attacks. To every kid in America tonight, I want you to know that your parents are working so hard to make your life better and to make your country better. <APPLAUSE> It's OK. The cameras are following us that is why. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> See now, the dishonest media will not report that. They won't report it. They say we're bad people. They're not going to report that. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> So here's the story, folks. It's a few people out of thousands. The dishonest media, these people, the most dishonest people you're going to ever find, they won't report that. They won't report the gesture. They won't report anything. But the good news is the cameras follow it. That's the only way I could get the cameras to move so they'll be able to see how many thousands of people we have here, how many thousands of people are outside but the media is disgusting. <APPLAUSE> Let me tell you honestly, somebody said, what have you learned most. I've learned, number one, how great the American people are and, number two, how dishonest the media is, totally dishonest. Look at that horrible sign. Look at that horrible disgusting sign. Look at that. Look at that horrible disgusting. Did you see the sign? Did you see it? Now let me tell you, nobody's going to report that. They'll say we were rude because we shouted them down. When are we going to get smart, folks? When are we going to get smart? You know the truth is that's why we have a movement. That is why we have a movement because we're not going to take it anymore I'm telling you. We're going to put sanity back into the White House. We are going to have law and order. We're going to have safety. We're going to have jobs. We're going to have education. We're going to protect our Second Amendment. We're going to do a lot of great things. And if I get the chance, I will fight right alongside of our people to deliver a much, much better future for everyone. We are people -- many of the people in this audience that made more money in real wages 18 years ago than they do today and they're working harder today and they've got two jobs. Not going to happen. Clinton made remarks at a high-dollar fundraiser in Wall Street. Her goal is simple, to bully the American voter out of voting for change. The people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are. It's been very good. They want to keep our terrible trade deals and they are terrible. They don't want renegotiation because they're on the other side of a lot of those horrible deals that are moving to Mexico and other places. They like them just fine but it's killing the American job. They want to trap children and failing government schools. They want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete with other businesses all over the world. Hillary Clinton can never be president of this country, not. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> What she just said shows what a low opinion she has of the American people. We just can't let that happen, folks. We can't let it happen. You got to get out, November 8th, you got to get out. October 20th, you start sending in those votes. You got to do it. Earlier today, I had a chance to spend some time with some of our most amazing Americans. I spent the afternoon with the National Guard Association of the United States. Incredible people. These are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters and who fight in our wars. These heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation. We also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice. There is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and for its people. Nothing greater than that. Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting. Let me also pause for a moment to recognize Shelby County Police Officer Tim Brackeen who was shot in the line of duty and died today leaving behind a wife and beautiful child. We mourn this terrible loss that we pledge to always stand with our incredible police and law enforcers. <APPLAUSE> In addition to supporting our law enforcement, we must also ensure that our men and women in the Armed services have the best equipment, resources and tools anywhere in the world. We don't anymore. We don't. We are totally depleted. We have the greatest people on earth but our military services are depleted with the bad equipment, the old equipment, it's a terrible thing that's happened. We must provide them with the best medical care while they serve and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life. The veteran scandals that have occurred under this administration and that have been dismissed by my opponent are a permanent stain on our government. It's just one more way Hillary Clinton only looks out for herself. We must take care of our veterans and that includes giving veterans a card that gives them the right to choose treatment in either public VA facilities or the private doctor of their choice. I have to do it. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> You look at what's happening where people are waiting on line five days, six days, seven days, 10 days and they're dying, 22 suicides a day, 22 suicides a day. Who can even believe that number when a simple solution could be at hand? A prescription, a small operation and they're dying and they're killing themselves and they've done so much for us. It's not going to happen any longer believe me. Just today, we learned that the VA has violated a federal law by failing to make its performance records available to consumers. The scandals never seem to end but they will end when I'm elected president and it will end quickly. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And Hillary Clinton was quoted fairly recently as saying, the VA is fine, the VA is working. Not working, Hillary. I've got to know so many veterans. Believe me, it's not working. Nothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who wear the uniform. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We've received endorsements from 120 generals and admirals. These are the people who know how to keep our country safe. These are our fighters. These are our great, great fighters. So I want to thank each and every one of them and there are more coming. Just today, I was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of 13 Medal of Honor recipients, 13. <APPLAUSE> And I can't even begin to say how much it means to me to have their support. These are truly great heroes. Also today, I was thrilled to announce that Ambassador R. James Woolsey, former head of the CIA, one of the most respected people anywhere in our government, is now a senior advisor to our campaign. This is one of the most respected people. Great man. We are on a mission of change and that includes a new agenda for our inner cities, our inner cities, folks. Our inner cities are a mess. The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for 50, 60, 70 and even a hundred years straight. Democratic politicians like Clinton disrespect these voters and take them for granted. They want the vote and they say see you in four years. They do nothing. Remember Hillary's words super predator. Remember that. Remember those words. Super predator, those are her words. Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty including, listen to this, 45 percent of those under the age of six. They live in poverty. Their schools are failing and 58 percent of African-American youths are not employed. Approximately 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. For those suffering and hurting, I say, give Donald Trump a chance. I will fix it. What do you have to lose? You have nothing to lose. It can't get any worse. It can't get any worse. You can go to war -- and you know this is true, you can go to Afghanistan. You can go to war-torn countries and you will find that it's safer than being in the middle of some of our inner cities. We're going to give security and safety. We're going to give education. We're going to get jobs. We're going to bring our jobs back from Mexico and all of these countries that have been stealing our job. We're going to get people working and we're going to love it. I will fight for Detroit and Chicago and Baltimore and for every neglected part of this nation and they're neglected by the Democrats. And I will fight to bring us all together as one American people, I will do that. And I say to the African-American people, I say it again and again, I will fix it and really what do you have to lose, it can't get any worse, what do you have to lose? I will fix it. <APPLAUSE> Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag, one American flag. <APPLAUSE> What's going on today, folks? What's going on today? It's time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace the new American future. This is a future we will respect. The dignity of all Americans and that means great jobs, great schools and great neighborhoods and it also means safety, it means safety. We will have the steadfast support for America and for its law enforcement. Everybody wants that. Everybody wants it. Jobs will return. Prosperity will rise and new factories will come rushing back to North Carolina and every other state in our country. <APPLAUSE> Government corruption will end. Honesty will be restored. Republicans are the party and remember these, folks, it's like people forget. We have to embrace it. Republicans are the party of Abraham Lincoln and come November 8th, we will once again have a government of by and for the people. <APPLAUSE> We will make America prosperous and successful again. We will make America safe again. You'll be able to walk down the street of your inner cities and not be shot. We will make America strong again and we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody. Thank you. November 8th, get out and vote. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-09-16"">
<TRUMP:> To all of you deplorables. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, man. Boy oh boy. We're going to have a good time tonight. We're going to have a good time. <APPLAUSE> Wow. I love that. I love that. Look at this. Look what that says. Hold up that sign for the cameras. Wow. <APPLAUSE> That's so beautiful. Thank you. Great. Thank you. That is so nice. And we are doing well in every way. The polls have been incredible. But we're doing great. It's great to be in my second home, Florida. <APPLAUSE> And in the city of Miami where I have so many wonderful friends and projects and employees. We have an amazing group. And all of you know Trump National Doral and we'll go there. Let's go and have some fun. <APPLAUSE> We have tremendous developments in Miami on the water and Doral in particular has been a tremendous, tremendous thing. So I really appreciate it. I love this city. I love the whole state. <APPLAUSE> So, and I have a lot of employees. And I'm paying them a lot of money. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, a lot of African-American employees, a lot of Hispanic employees. <APPLAUSE> A lot. And they're very happy. They like Donald Trump. So new polls have just come in. And we're leading in many of the battleground states all over the country. <APPLAUSE> Including being four points up in a certain state known as Florida. <APPLAUSE> And the Los Angeles Times has us six points up nationwide. Good poll. If it weren't, I wouldn't be telling you about it, I promise. But come November 8, we're going to win Florida. And we're going to win the White House. And we're going to make America great again. <APPLAUSE> It's going to be a victory for the people. It's going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the veterans. The veterans. We love our veterans. <APPLAUSE> And every citizen of this country. It's going to be a victory for those who haven't had reason to hope for a very long time. I'm campaigning in every community and every part of this country for every last vote. <APPLAUSE> I'm running to be a president for all Americans. I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti. <APPLAUSE> Good place. Unbelievable people. And I'm going to be campaigning hard for their votes. And they are incredible people. Our support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life, all. All of them. And by the way, at Little Haiti they presented me with something that I figured I'd put on. Is that OK to put it on? <APPLAUSE> They gave me that and I love it. I think it's great.
<AUDIENCE: We love you.>
<TRUMP:> Your cops and soldiers -- thank you. I love you too. <APPLAUSE> Carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, Black, white and Hispanic. But above all, we are together and we are Americans. <APPLAUSE> We got to pull our country together. Just today I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor, brave people. And many, many of our most amazing military leaders, generals, admirals, amazing people, real fighters. They really know what they're doing. We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and admirals. <APPLAUSE> I didn't know we had that many. Well, we love them. We also have the support of 16,500 Border Patrol officers. <APPLAUSE> The first time in the history of the Border Patrol that they've endorsed any presidential candidate. As well as law enforcement officers, police, all across the country. <APPLAUSE> In fact, I'm very excited to announce tonight that we just received a few minutes ago an endorsement of the largest police union in the country, the Fraternal Order of Police. Number one by far. <APPLAUSE> Pretty good. Pretty good. And we have the support of millions of patriotic moms and dads who go to work every day and make our country run. While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable... <BOOING> Boy that second word is tough. You don't hear that as much. But that means you're never going to come back, folks. And I know you're going to come back. We're going to come back so strong. We're going to be so strong. Stronger than ever before. Irredeemable. They don't talk about that one. But that was, to me, pretty bad. I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and really, really, really love your country. Love your country. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Clinton's entire campaign rests on using a single tactic, and it's not working very well. She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on phony campaign ads. And we're actually I think probably leading, based on everything we're seeing. And we've spent practically nothing. I'm proud of that. <APPLAUSE> And you know what? <APPLAUSE> We're doing very well. You know in the old days if you spent less and you had far fewer people and you were leading you got credit. Today they say well, she's spending much more money. Yes, but she's doing poorly, very poorly. But what they do is they smear opponents. And you look at her history. And they question policies. And they talk all the time about racist, racist. It's the only word they know. They used it on Romney. They used it on everybody. They use it. When they're in trouble, they always pull out the racist word. And they are in very big trouble, I have to tell you. <APPLAUSE> And for the most part we haven't even started spending our money yet. And we have raised a lot of money. And I'm putting in my money. And I put in a hell of a lot of money. In fact... <APPLAUSE> ... if things don't work out, even though a lot of people are saying this was one of the great political phenomenas they've ever seen. They've never seen -- they call it a phenomena. I will tell you. If it doesn't work out, it will be a tremendous waste of time, energy and money. And she's angry for even suggesting it. <APPLAUSE> But we're going to -- hey look, November 8 you go and vote. We're winning. I'll tell you what. If you vote, we're winning. <APPLAUSE> There's no way they can beat us. <APPLAUSE> There's no way she can beat us because her people have no enthusiasm whatsoever. They're not going to turn out. They don't have the enthusiasm. Who could possibly have enthusiasm? What are you getting? You turn out winning big league. And I think -- and they're all saying the Trump people are going to turn out. We have a movement like they have never, ever seen in this country. <APPLAUSE> And they say in terms of enthusiasm they have never had polling higher. So I think, I have very little doubt, turnout we're going to have a tremendous November 8. Probably we'll say November 8 plus the next four years and then four years after that, OK? <APPLAUSE> But the racist word, it's the oldest play in the Democratic playbook, and Americans have had enough of it, OK. We get it. We get it. I'll tell you what, I just -- I told you I just left Little Haiti. The love is unbelievable. It's unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> There's no racist. There's no nothing. It's love. They want solutions. They want better lives, not more petty attacks from failed and totally discredited politicians like crooked Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> They want their immigration laws enforced and their border secured.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Let's win on November 8, OK? That'll be... <APPLAUSE> They're patriotic Americans of all background who want their jobs and their families protected. They want protection. People who warn about radical Islamic terrorism are not Islamophobes. Everyone's an Islamophobe. You mention something you're an Islamophobe. You know they come up with words. Hey, I went to Ivy League school. I did very well. They have so many new words. Islamophobe. We have a president, and frankly Hillary, who don't use the words radical Islamic terrorism. And if you don't know what you're fighting, you're not going to fight it very well. And we've proven that. We have decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe. We want to keep our country safe. People who support the police, who want crime reduced and ended, and who are not prejudiced. They're concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is killed violently on the streets, which is happening all over our country. Yet while Hillary Clinton lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from -- you know look what she's doing with these hedge funds. Raising millions and millions. I know so many of these people. Give me a break. The hedge fund and the Wall Street donors she slanders and smears with her statements last week. Working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians and certainly enjoyed by her. Now you know she's very much against the Second Amendment. She wants to destroy your Second Amendment. <BOOING> Guns, guns, guns, right. I think what we should do is she goes around with armed bodyguards like you have never seen before. I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm right? <APPLAUSE> Right? I think they should disarm immediately. What do you think? Yes? Yes. <APPLAUSE> Take their guns away. She doesn't want guns. Take their -- let's see what happens to her. Take their guns away. OK? It'll be very dangerous. Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of State, hide and delete her e-mails, destroy her iPhones with a hammer. With a hammer. Thirteen of them. <BOOING> Put classified information in the reach of our enemies. Lie to Congress. And sell government favors and access through her foundation. It's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disaster she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world. Everything she touched, it just didn't work out. Certainly it didn't work out for our country. It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS all over the world. <BOOING> Her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home. We see it. Look, we see it. I drove here. We see it. We see it. I'm running to reverse these failures. And they are incredible failures. And create a new American future. <APPLAUSE> And that future begins with prosperity at home. <APPLAUSE> My economic agenda can be summed up in three words. And you're going to like these three words. Jobs, jobs, jobs. <APPLAUSE> One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities. African-American communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership. Democrats have run these inner cities for a half a century, for 60 years, 75 years, even in some cases 100 years straight. Unabated. Unbroken. Over 100 years. They control the mayor's offices, the school boards, the city councils and the seats in Congress. And all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime and more failing schools. Sixty-five percent of African-American children under the age of six now live in poverty. More than 3,000 people have been shot in the city of Chicago this year. This year. Think of it, since Jan. 1. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working. Can't get a job. These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton. And everyone knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and suffering and crime and heartache. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump! (APPLAUSE)>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Amazing people. Amazing country. We have an amazing country. And honestly you see the crime statistics. Your African- American. You have the inner city problems that have been going on forever. Forever. You have problems like nobody has. And you look at crime. You look at schools. You look at no jobs. Look at the worse education. Look how dangerous. You can't walk down the street. You get shot or your child gets shot. And I've been saying it. And I'll say it openly and some people like it and some people don't like it. And I don't really care. <APPLAUSE> What do you have to lose? I will fix it. I'm going to fix it. We're going to fix our inner cities. We're going to make them safe. We're going to bring jobs back. So to the African-American people within the community, what do you have to lose? It can't get -- honestly, it can't get -- that's so nice. Thank you. It can't get any worse. It can't get any worse. It can't get any worse.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> So nice. Thank you. Thank you very much. It can't get any worse, the crime, the jobs. No jobs. No education. Worse education. More unsafe -- you go to Afghanistan, right. We hear Afghanistan. I mean we have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan. Inner cities. African-American people within that community and outside of that community are going to be voting for Donald Trump in record numbers. <APPLAUSE> You watch. <APPLAUSE> We're going to fix it. Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years. Her disastrous record speaks for itself. And I have to tell you. When she ran for the United States Senate in New York, we have Upstate New York which is a total disaster, economic disaster. She said she's going to bring back jobs, jobs, jobs. She -- anyway, she gets elected. We lost our jobs. It got worse. She didn't do anything. She didn't do anything. She went home. She went to sleep, OK. She didn't do anything. She didn't do anything. It got worse. Far worse. Now it's a total catastrophe. Just remember that. When she tells you about jobs, when she tells you she's going to fix trade deals, she wouldn't know where to begin. She wouldn't know where to begin. And besides that, to do that kind of thing, to negotiate great trade deals, to re-enhance our -- I mean look. Our military is so depleted. We have the greatest people on earth. They're using equipment that's old. They're flying planes that are old. You see what's happening. It's a depleted military. We have to have a strong military. We have to take care of our vets. <APPLAUSE> We have to take care of our vets. <APPLAUSE> But to do these things you need a lot of energy. And she does not have the energy. And in my opinion she is totally unfit to be the president of the United States. <APPLAUSE> The only people that she will deliver for, frankly, are her donors and her special interests. I'm going to deliver for you. Believe me. The American people. We're going to deliver. You're going to be happy. And those inner cities are going to see progress like they have probably, not probably. Like they have never seen. You watch. Like they have never seen. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> If we lower our taxes and we're getting a massive tax reduction -- and by the way, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes substantially. <BOOING> If we remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy. We have so much energy. It's being destroyed, our economic worth. And negotiate trade deals that put America first. Then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash. There is no limit. Pay off our debt. Pay down our debt. Reduce taxes. Get rid of regulations. My first day in office I'm going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last 10 years. <APPLAUSE> All needless, job-killing regulations will be immediately canceled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in. And we're going to lift the restrictions on American energy which means at least another half a million jobs each year. They are being destroyed. <APPLAUSE> And we're unable to compete with other nations. Very simple. And that's just the beginning. Also on my first day I'm going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare... <APPLAUSE> It has turned out to be a disaster. <APPLAUSE> This alone will instantly save another two million jobs. And if you look at your premiums, it's through the roof. And by the way, on November 1, just before the election on November 8, new numbers are coming out which will show 40, 50, 60 percent increases. They want to delay it until after the election because it's election -- it's a disaster. It's a disaster. And your deductibles are so high that unless you lead a really long, slow, vicious death, you're never going to be able to use, OK. Do you see the deductibles? You're never going to be able to use it. I'm also going to completely reform our trade deals. We're going to renegotiate NAFTA. <APPLAUSE> Probably the worst trade deal ever agreed to, signed in the history of the world, not in the United States. It's destroyed our manufacturing in our country. It's destroyed. And by the way, guess who signed it? Bill Clinton. <BOOING> You look at all of the places, Florida included. But you look at Upstate New York, you look at Ohio, you look at Pennsylvania. You look at all of these different places have been destroyed. Absolutely destroyed. You look at New England. Look what happened to New England. They've been destroyed by companies moving out, going into Mexico, firing everybody. Unemployment through the roof. We're going to stand up to China, and keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another catastrophe. <APPLAUSE> TPP will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing can be as bad as NAFTA. Trans-Pacific Partnership will be almost as bad as NAFTA. It'll take your jobs, Ohio. Remember, it's going to take your jobs, Ohio. I tell you that. Michigan. So many places. TPP is a disaster. We don't need another massive multinational deal, by the way, that nobody on our side even reads, that ties us up and binds us down and doesn't even discuss monetary manipulation and devaluation, which is how China and all these countries are beating us so badly. Not even discussed. And they had provisions in the agreement, and they would take it out because certain politicians didn't want to have them in there. I wonder why. Another major reform is going to be school choice. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to terminate Common Core. And we're bringing our education local. <APPLAUSE> I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice. <APPLAUSE> This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty, something we are going to do. Since President Obama came into office another two million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty. It's catastrophic. And it's totally unacceptable. To the Hispanic community I say we are going to protect your jobs. We're going to build up your schools. And we're going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children. You have no safety. You have little opportunity. <APPLAUSE> This week I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality child care for their children. Ivanka Trump, very much for child care. She's been talking about that to me for two years, long before I even decided to go through this journey. And it's not easy, I want to tell you. We speak in rooms like this. This is about 100 degrees right now. That's considered a cool auditorium. And the reason is we have such big crowds like this one. Look at that. Every single corner. <APPLAUSE> Unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> These rooms weren't designed for this many people. And it is hot in these rooms. And we stand up here and we talk. And we do two or three and sometimes we'll be hitting four a day. Do you think Hillary Clinton can get through one?
<AUDIENCE: No.>
<TRUMP:> You ever see her 18-minute speech? Bomb. Bomb. Bomb. See ya. See ya. I'm going home. No. We're doing it the right way. And frankly, when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising I don't have to because I do it the old fashioned way. I come into your neighborhood, right. <APPLAUSE> It's a lot cheaper. It's a lot harder work, but it's a lot cheaper. <APPLAUSE> Very true. Very, very true. On policy after policy we're going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans. We're also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against Communist oppression. <APPLAUSE> No, we're on the right side. Great people. They're great people. The president's one-sided deal for Cuba and with Cuba benefits only the Castro regime. <BOOING> People are very unhappy about it. You know what's interesting? When he landed the plane recently in China, right, they refused to give him a stairway out of Air Force One. Now that is a first in the history of Air Force One. So he used basically the mechanics' stairs. That's the stairs they drop down to get the mechanics up to fix the light bulb, right. <LAUGHTER> When he landed the plane in Saudi Arabia, which we protect. Without us they wouldn't be there for two months. He landed in Saudi Arabia. He wasn't greeted by the top officials. Now what would I have done in those two cases? Bomb. Take me back to Washington, Jim. Let's go. <APPLAUSE> Right. Let's go. <APPLAUSE> Let's go, Jim. Get going. Close those doors. We're going home. <APPLAUSE> Now with Cuba, with Cuba we land in Cuba and there's no Castro to greet him. The big leaders weren't there to greet him. And I have a lot of Cuban friends. But you would have all done the same thing again. Jim, let's close those doors. We're going home. Right? <APPLAUSE> Right? <APPLAUSE> Let's go, captain. We're going home. We're going into Washington. Maybe we'll head into Miami actually. That's not a bad idea. <APPLAUSE> Terrible. That's three. Three. Saudi Arabia, Cuba, China. Air Force One has never been treated so badly in its long and incredible history. Air Force One used to land and people would respect the people inside. And they'd come out and there'd be all sorts of hoopla. Not anymore. It's unbelievable. And these are countries that are benefited by us greatly. So we have to make great deals before we do anything with Cuba or anybody else, right. We're going to make great deals. You'll be happy. You're going to be happy, I tell you. How many people are from Cuba here? Come here. Tell me. <APPLAUSE> Cuban. Cuban. Good. Do you agree with me? Do you agree? <APPLAUSE> We'll do it. But we'll do it with great deals. And we'll do it with democracy. And we'll do it the way we have to do it. OK? We'll do it the right way. Where is Ms. Delgado? Does everybody know? What a great -- where is she? She is so amazing. A.J. Where is A.J. Wow, she's so -- she's become a tremendous star. Tell you one thing, when she's representing me I wouldn't do it anyway, but I can. Turn off the television. I'm well protected. Thank you. Great job. Thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, A.J. <APPLAUSE> But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them. And that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands. Not my demands, our demands. You know what the demands are. <APPLAUSE> Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people. <APPLAUSE> And the freeing of political prisoners. The freeing of political prisoners. <APPLAUSE> Right? Am I -- is that right? <APPLAUSE> Oh boy. Oh boy. What energy in this room. What energy. <APPLAUSE> A lot of energy.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> You'll be very happy, my Cuban friends. I have so many friends from Cuba. Incredible people. So let's also talk about a place called Venezuela. <APPLAUSE> They -- now who's here from Venezuela? Or related in some -- not too many. Whoa. Whoa. What's going on? Not too many? Friend or foe? I think he's friend. <BOOING> I think he's friend. <BOOING> No, he's OK. He's OK. By the way, is there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally? You tell me. <APPLAUSE> Right? <APPLAUSE> Tell you. We have a lot of Venezuelans around Doral, the Doral section, right. And it's a beautiful, vibrant -- this is an amazing place. But they are really having trouble over in Venezuela. But Miami is filled with hardworking, incredible Venezuelan people. <APPLAUSE> But it's been hurt very badly by Socialist Venezuela. And the next president of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our atmosphere. And we will stand with oppressed people. And there are many. The oppressed people of Venezuela, they are yearning to be free. They are yearning for help. The system is bad. But the people are great. Great. <APPLAUSE> They are great people. Here in America I'll push to expand freedom for all of our citizens. I'm going to lower your taxes so substantially. <APPLAUSE> We're getting rid of all of those regulations on business. So many small business owners here, I know five of them. One of them was small business now he's big business. I'm proud of him. He's right here. But we're going to get rid of those terrible, terrible regulations. He just said to me, and the thing that surprised me most, we're bringing business tax rates down from 35 percent to 15 percent. And yet... <APPLAUSE> ... it'll be the greatest cut, I believe, in the history of our country. But I will tell you what surprises me tremendously is that the people that have these cuts, they're more concerned with regulation than even a big tax decrease because regulations are choking and killing our businesses and stopping our businesses from hiring people, jobs. So I'm going to appoint justices of the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to rebuild our depleted <military>. We're going to take care of our -- the vets. Who's a vet? Who's a vet? <APPLAUSE> Where are my vets? Where are they? There they -- OK. Now they're standing up. Now they -- I know we had a lot of vets here. Thank you, fellas. Thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to save your Second Amendment. Do you know if you look at some of the things, the catastrophes -- you look at Orlando. You look at San Bernardino. You look at so many different -- you look at Paris. The toughest gun laws in the world, they have it in Paris. These thugs, these animals walked in and they just go bomb, bomb, bomb. Nobody had guns on the other side. If there were guns on the other side, just a few of them, number one, probably if they knew, they wouldn't have attacked. And number two, even if they did attack, it would've been a whole different story. One hundred thirty people killed. People massively injured, still in the hospital. Their lives are just destroyed. And if they had protection, if they had guns on the other side, with the bullets flying the other direction, it would've been a whole different story. So we're going to protect your Second Amendment. And I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs from coming into our country. <APPLAUSE> And yes, we will build a wall. We'll build a wall. <APPLAUSE> We will build a wall.
<AUDIENCE: Build a wall! Build a wall! Build a wall!>
<TRUMP:> Who's going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And we're going to be renegotiating NAFTA and our terrible trade deals. We're going to make great deals out of horrible deals. And if we can't renegotiate the deal because the other side is so, so happy with it, we're going to terminate the deal and we'll start all over again, folks. We'll have new deals. And they'll be much better deals. And they'll be two-way streets. The traffic, it'll be coming our way. It's a one-way street out of the United States for our jobs and our money. You know I always say we get the drugs they get the cash. That's the deal, folks. No good. They're building in Mexico right now, and Mexico's just one example, some of the greatest plants. A friend of mine builds plants. And he tells me all the time. I called him up the other day. I called him up six months ago, told me the same thing. Nothing changes. Ford. They just announced yesterday they're moving their Small Car Division, the whole thing, into Mexico. <BOOING> That's on top of spending billions and billions of dollars... <BOOING> And then you wonder why I'm winning in Michigan. Because I've been telling the people in Michigan. I've been telling the people in Ohio for five years that this is happening. And our politicians don't do anything about it. And Hillary Clinton will never do anything about it. She doesn't have the capability to do it. We will rebuild our roads and bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads. American planes will soar in the sky. They'll soar. <APPLAUSE> And American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers right here in Miami into the clouds. But it'll be American steel. <APPLAUSE> American hands will rebuild this nation. And American energy mined from American sources will power our energy. And we'll take care of our steel workers. And we'll take care of our miners who have been destroyed by this administration, destroyed. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary Clinton has already said she's going to put the miners out of business. We're going to take care of our miners. They're amazing people. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of our country. <APPLAUSE> I will fight for every neglected part of this nation. And I will fight to bring us all together as one people. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> It's time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future. We're not prosperous anymore. We owe $20 trillion. We have a president who in seven-and-a-half years has doubled the debt. Our country's in trouble. A lot of people don't know it, but our country's in trouble. And we're going to make sure that trouble never comes. Let me tell you. <APPLAUSE> Jobs will return. Incomes will rise. And new factories will come rushing back to our shores. Once more we will have a government of, by and for the people. <APPLAUSE> We will make America wealthy again. <APPLAUSE> We will make America safe again. <APPLAUSE> We will make America strong again. <APPLAUSE> And we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Miami.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-09-29"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. Wow, this is a wonderful crowd at this time, this is beautiful. A lot of people coming in from outside. So they'll just come in. Should we wait? Should we wait? 
<AUDIENCE: No.>
<TRUMP:> We'll start, right?
<AUDIENCE: Yes.>
<TRUMP:> OK. It's great to be back into Hampshire, really. This is a state and special place. You know, this is where I had my first victory, we do know that, right? Right? <APPLAUSE> It's such a -- I mean it's a special place, it really is. And you know what really amaze me when I came here and I got to know so many people, so many are in the room, so many great friends, and they said the biggest single problem they have up here is heroin. And I said how does heroin work with these beautiful lakes and trees and all of the beautiful, it doesn't, but it's the single biggest problem. And I said that if I win, I get the nomination and I win, we'll going to build that wall and we're going to stop that heroin from pouring in. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to stop the poison of the youth. We're going to build the wall, believe me.
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall.>
<TRUMP:> We are going to build the wall but we're going to stop the poison from pouring in and destroying our youth and plenty of other people. And we're going to work on those people that got addicted and are addicted. And I'll tell you what, we're going to do a real job for the state of New Hampshire. And I owe something very special because again, this was my first victory and this is where it all started, so just remember. <APPLAUSE> Look at how many people are here, look at what happened recently. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders had very few people at their rally yesterday and that's because they don't like Hillary, and Bernie sold out to the devil. You know if Bernie -- if Bernie had made his deal and just done something where maybe he did nothing and just run away, he would have been a legendary character, he would have been a legendary political figure. But the deal he made with Hillary was not the right thing and it wasn't representative of what he should have done to his people and we're going to have a lot of Bernie's people supporting us especially because of my views on trade. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have a lot of Bernie people but he should never have made the deal. And I'll beg you, he waste, he didn't make that deal, that was not the right deal for him to make. The people of New Hampshire and everywhere else don't care about Bernie anymore because now, they're looking to the future and the future is going to be something special. I love the people of New Hampshire and we're going to fulfill every single wish, every single promise, we're going to do something very, very significant for you. You're strong, you're independent and you are free. We're going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, can you believe it, 40 days, this started June 16th to New York City and here we are. And we're going to win the state, we're going to win back the White House, we're going to make America great again. <APPLAUSE> We're going to take on the special interest, the lobbyist and the corrupt corporate media that have rig this system against everyday Americans and they've rigged it for a long time. We're going to create millions of new jobs and we really need them, we need jobs. People have given up looking for jobs. We're going to create trillions of dollars and new wealth for our communities and rising wages for every worker in America. We're going to create a new government that serves you and your family and your country. We're going to end the Clinton corruption and restore... <APPLAUSE> I mean did you see what happened yesterday? Did you see what happened yesterday? With the Director of the FBI talking about the e- mails? <BOOING> I don't think I've ever seen a thing like that, it's an embarrassment. I don't think I've ever seen a thing like that in my life and it really is a sad -- it was a sad, sad -- honestly, it's a sad time for the United States. It's a very, very sad time. And yesterday was a sad, a very sad day. Let's see what happens. I think -- I actually believe because of what happened yesterday, I think that whole thing has a long way to go. So we're going to see what happens. Hillary -- right? I mean is it incredible? Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors. I'm an outsider fighting for you. Everything... <APPLAUSE> Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton, sometimes referred to as crooked Hillary, can be understood with a simple but very important phrase, ""Follow the money."" The large corporations who support terrible trade deals, offshore jobs, they take these jobs, they offshore the jobs, they're donating to Hillary Clinton. It's called, follow the money. The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class, they're donating to Hillary Clinton, follow the money. The wealthy donors want to shutdown American energy, they're donating to Hillary Clinton, follow the money. The special interests who want to open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton, again just follow the money. In her campaign for president, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds. She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval office, and she doesn't speak well, figure that one. In fact they had a very small group of people which you here yesterday, very small crows, very, very sad. <LAUGHTER> Hundred million dollars, I don't think so folks, what's going on? The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for the speeches were lobbying the federal government. Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbying the state department while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks. She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale. And if she ever got the chance, she put the Oval office up for sale too. <BOOING> She deleted and bleached 33,000 e-mails after a congressional subpoena was issued. After -- think of it, after she gets a subpoena -- she gets a subpoena, she sees the subpoena, she then gets rid of 33,000 e-mails on top of a lot of other things. If you did that in your civilian life, you would have problems for the rest of your life. Thirteen phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Who in this room has destroyed their phone with a hammer, anybody? Anybody? Oh, there is one person. What business is that person in I want to find out? Yes. Well, Benghazi is a horrible thing. You saw what happened about taking 5th amendment and her ring leader's getting immunity deals will call them really the FBI immunity five. Nobody has ever seen? They gave so much immunity, there was nobody left to talk too. There was nobody left except Hillary. They probably gave her immunity too. Do you think Hillary got immunity? Yeah, she got the immunity. She had something. You know, when you think of it, she did so much worse than anybody else. People that did a tiny fraction of what she did, their lives have been destroyed and here she is running for president. It's a dishonestly, it's a disgrace. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server and they did lies to congress under a -- about turning over her work related e-mails. Remember she said on her e-mails, it was about yoga classes and it was about a wedding, 33,000 yoga, wedding. She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything lie about anything to keep their grip on power, to keep their control over this country. The American people have had it with years and decades of Clinton corruption and scandals, corruption and scandals. <APPLAUSE> And impeachment for lying -- impeachment for lying. Remember that, impeach. They're tired of the lies, they're tired of the tribunal politics, they're tired of being talked down too, look down upon and treated like second class citizens and they're phenomenal people. You are phenomenal people. But Clintons are disordered pass, we will be very bright and clean future. <APPLAUSE> While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty destructions. This will be the year the American people say, finally, enough is enough. It's gonna start with New Hampshire. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African- Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton. They're too smart and they know they are just being used by her and her campaign. <APPLAUSE> They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over, she never does and that will never ever change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men super predators. Not nice. Same thing goes for Hispanic voters and they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over. A Trump administration will bring prosperity to all of the people of our great country. <APPLAUSE> We'll bring prosperity. Look at what happened to your jobs. Look at what happened to your jobs. Look at what happened to all of those companies that left and went to Mexico and other places and you are probably the number one group of people that were affected if you think about it and the whole country. My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words, jobs, jobs, jobs. We're going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and we're going to lower. <APPLAUSE> That's right. And remember she's raising taxes substantially. And we're going to lower the business rate from 35 percent all the way down to 15 percent making America into a magnet for new jobs and growth. <APPLAUSE> Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated along with every illegal executive order. We will unleash the power of American energy, we're going and we're sitting, right now, sitting on $50 trillion of untapped energy reserves and we're going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to start reducing debt. Common core will be ended and disadvantage... <APPLAUSE> And disadvantage children will be allow to attend the school of their choice, choice, big word, choice. Very important word. The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced. <APPLAUSE> And it's dying of its own volition anyway. You see what's happening, it's dying. And the disastrous trade deals like NAFTA that have caused so much pain in New Hemisphere will be renegotiated and I mean renegotiated for your benefit not to the benefit of Mexico, we're going to either change it or we'll start all over again folks and it will be a big, big difference believe me. NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton and supported by crooked Hillary and your state has lost one and three manufactory jobs since it was approved, it's a catastrophe. It's the worst trade deal ever negotiated and ever made -- not only in the United States, probably anywhere in the world. There's never been a deal like this. You've lost one and four jobs, think of it, since China entered the World Trade Organization so you lost one and four -- this another deal with the Clintons. And Hillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career, and if that she gets the chance -- and this is a 100 percent -- she would approve to Trans-Pacific Partnership which will destroy so much more of your manufacturing in the state. Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interest trying to script this contrive its wealth, its jobs and its status as a sovereign nation. Remember she called TPP the goal standard. And then during the debate the night where every single online poll said, we won -- which is great -- every single online poll. <APPLAUSE> And during the debate the other night, she was saying, no, she never said that she said it, I mean she said it and then I had to put up -- then I had to put up with the anchor and fight the anchor all the time on everything I said. What a rigged deal, I'll tell you where in such a rig sits <ph> -- it is terrible. What's going on in this country is so sad but it will change. Remember November 8th, November 8th. <APPLAUSE> She called it the goal standard, it's the goal standard for destroying wealth and jobs. She's a globalist who has made a career of taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries. I'm not running to be president of the world, I'm running to be president of the United States of America and we're going to do a great job. <APPLAUSE> From now on it's going to be America first, America first.
<AUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Have you ever wondered why it's that old things that the American people want, they never seem to happened. Things they want just don't happen. Just thing about it, for how many years have the American people asked for a tax code to be fixed or for infrastructure to be repaired. We've been talking about this for years or for the waste to be removed from our budget. For many years and how many have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, just fair deals, we're going to make great deals by the way, we're going to make great deals, but just fair deals and quality schools that serve parents and students. All the things you've ever wanted for your country have been denied, they've been denied. The reason is very simple, it's because the financial interest who control our politics and our media don't want this changes to happen. The special interest control totally Hillary Clinton, look at the money. Somebody said she's spending on commercials in certain areas, 50 to one and we're tied or I'm leading. <APPLAUSE> How do you do that? Fifty, think of it. Fifty commercials to every one I'm putting up, and we're tied, and I'm even leading in some of these areas. She's there chosen representative. She's been there for 30 years and has never done anything for you or your family. She's there for only one reason to protect their donors and collect their money. Our campaign is taken on big business, big media and big donors, we're taking them on for you. That's what we're doing. I didn't need to do this. Believe me, I built a great, great company, I didn't need to do this, we're going to straighten it out. <APPLAUSE> We want you to have the future that you want and that you deserve. That includes very importantly keeping your family safe. New FBI statistics just out, show that homicide rose 15 percent last year in America's large cities and that is the biggest single year increase in 45 years. You don't hear these numbers, right? Nobody tells you. More than 3,000 people had been shot in Chicago since January, that wasn't a long time ago, 3,000 people. That's -- say it again.
<AUDIENCE: Yes, we can.>
<TRUMP:> That's -- say it again.
<AUDIENCE: Yes we can.>
<TRUMP:> Yes we can. He goes, ""Yes, we can."" <LAUGHTER> Boy. That can only happen in New Hampshire, right? Right? <APPLAUSE> The fail politicians and the arrogant media don't want me to talk about the crime and the violence that's happening at this country. They just want me to go along with the status quo, well, I have news for the people trying to silence me and you and trying to silence all of us. We will never back down, we -- we -- we will never back down from fighting, we are going to save American lives and we're going to turn this whole big ship around and it's going to be turned around quickly. <APPLAUSE> That also means keeping our nation safe from radical Islamic terrorism. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton doesn't say the words and certainly President Obama will never say the words. We'll also going to keep our country safe from drugs. New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across the border. The rate of heroin overdose has nearly quadrupled in the state. Once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people and specially more than any place to state, I've never seen anything like it with what's happening with the drugs more so than other places and other places are disaster but we're going to turn it around, we're going to turn it around for New Hampshire. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to stop the drugs from pouring across the border and that is a promise. The people getting rich of the rig system or the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Our campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in Washington D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collision between the wealthy donors, the large corporations and the media executives who are among the most honest people anywhere that I have met. They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment and they're not alone when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable. You don't look deplorable to me, and you know, look irredeemable. I call you hardworking American patriots and together, we're going to save our country. <APPLAUSE> Together, we can accomplish anything we want. We have a movement going on, it's a movement like they've never seen in this country. Some of the great pundits have said and they say it often, some of the pundits that don't even like me says the single greatest political phenomenon they have ever seen. We had in Florida the other night, we had 25,000 people. No matter where we go, we have rooms that have packed with unbelievable Americans. And I'll tell you what, come November 8th, I think the world is going to see something that's really going to be special. <APPLAUSE> But that means you have to show up and vote. <APPLAUSE> So if you're sick, you're not feeling well, it's like you just don't think you're even going to make it. And the doctor comes in and he looks at you and he says, you're right, you're not going to make it. We don't care, right? You have to get out of bed and you have to vote. <APPLAUSE> You have to knock on doors, you have to pick up that phone, you have to campaign on the streets, spread the love then we have in this room to the people of our country. We're going to bring our system together, we're going to bring our country together, we're going to have unity, we're divided nation in so many different ways. We're divided nation. Just turn on your televisions at night and you'll see what a divided nation we are in this no reason for to beat the system and -- I will fix it. To beat the system, you have to lift up your voice, pound the pavement and get out that vote. Visit our website -- I always hate saying that because it's sounds so like boring. But that's the way it is, visit our website. You have 40 days until the election. You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dream to your country come true. Do not let this opportunity slip away. I don't believe were ever going to have this opportunity again. This is it. This is it. You will never going to have this opportunity again. You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten men, woman and child in this nation. There are many. The arrogance of Washington D.C. will soon come face-to-face with the righteous verdict of the American voter on November 8th. <APPLAUSE> You know that, you know it. On November 8th, we're going to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and bigger -- oh you know that, right? You know. You know it. America will be back, I promise, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. Bigger and better and stronger. Here are just some of the things -- and these are great things -- that will happen for your country. We're going to lower your taxes, she is going to raise your taxes. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary regulation that are strangling your businesses, she's going to add more regulation. We're going to repeal and replace job killing Obamacare. We're going to make childcare more affordable and available to the families and to the mothers, we need help. Childcare, something that my daughter Ivanka feels very strongly about. So do I. We're going to bring back our manufacturing jobs which have been ripped away from us by incompetent politicians. We're going to keep radical Islamic terrorist out of our country. <APPLAUSE> Did you see the other day where they were going to deport 800 people and they made a slight mistake. Instead of deporting these 800 people, they made the 800 people citizens of the United States. <BOOING> And they want to say, well, that's OK, you can change it around can't you, if you made a mistake. And they said, that might not be constitutional. Can you believe this, what's going on? And the mistake also was they think it wasn't really 800 people. It was 1800 people. This is like the $400 million in cash that we gave to Iran, 400 -- but this is in cash. We gave it to Iran as part of one of the worse deals I've ever seen in the history of -- in my life, I'd never seen anything like it. But as part, we gave them $400 million in cash but that turned out to be wrong also, it is $1.7 billion in cash. You know what, $1.7 billion in cash is I think would be starting around here will go up to ceiling. Who can authorize this? Who would be so stupid to authorize that? You're right. We're going to save the second amendment which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> We are going to support the man and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We're going to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> We will rebuild our roads, our bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospital. American cars will travel the roads. American planes will soar the skies and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send sky scrapers, new beautiful skies scrapers into the clouds. American hands, hands, hands will rebuild -- will rebuild this nation. And American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job not workers from other countries. We will put new American steel into the spine of the United States. <APPLAUSE> I will fight for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag. <APPLAUSE> It's time to break with the bitter failures of the past of which we have many and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous American future. And I say it all the time, we don't win anymore. We don't win. When was the last time you see us have a win? When do we have companies moving into our country? We don't have it. Just look at New England, look at Ohio, look at all of -- look at Pennsylvania, look at what's happened. Now, we're going to turn things around, folks. We're going to start winning again. We're going to win so much if you people are going to be angry at me. You're going to say, Mr. President you're winning too much. We're not used to it, we cannot take it anymore. Please stop winning. And you know what I'm going to say? Sorry, folks, we have a lot of ground to capture. <APPLAUSE> Once more we will have a government of by and for the people. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. And we will make America great again. Thank you all very much. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. God bless you everybody. God bless you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-09-30"">
<TRUMP:> Wow. Wow. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. It is so great to be back in Michigan. <APPLAUSE> A state I've come to know and love during this campaign. You know, we won Michigan, and that was a great, big, fat, beautiful victory. You know that right? <APPLAUSE> And I've been talking about Michigan for a long time. We can't let them take your car industry out or your industry out of your state any longer. Not going to happen. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to fight so hard for all of you, and I'm going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and from our country. <APPLAUSE> In 39 days, 39 days, can you imagine? This started off -- we're a long ways away. And some people didn't give us a good chance. They said, Mr. Trump, the other day one of the biggest people in that business, the very dishonest press business... <BOOING> They said, Mr. Trump, when you started off, you have to tell me the truth. Did you really think you'd be here? I said, what the hell do you think I'm doing this for? Right? <APPLAUSE> No, we expected to be here. And we're all here together. It's a movement. And believe me, we're all here together. We're going to take our country back. <APPLAUSE> We're going to win the state of Michigan. We're going to win the White House. And it's going to be an awfully good November 8th. That evening is going to be a celebration. <APPLAUSE> We're going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs through theft and incompetence. They've stolen your wealth. They've taken your middle class. We're going to take on the arrogant, corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of American prosperity. <APPLAUSE> A theft that has left behind crumbling schools, roads, bridges, and a totally depleted military. We have the greatest people in the world in our military. We're going to rebuild our military. This is when we need it. <APPLAUSE> It's time, by the way, to rebuild Detroit. We're going to rebuild Detroit. It's time to rebuild Michigan and we're not letting them take your jobs out of Michigan any longer. <APPLAUSE> And it's time to rebuild the United States of America. We're going to do it. Our country is going to be greater than ever before. We're going to be the smart country again. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have raided our factories and ripped the jobs right out of Michigan and every other state. <BOOING> That's how she gets rich, by taking your jobs and your money away from you and away from your state.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> That's why Hillary Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100 percent approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. <BOOING> The deal she lied about the other night, when I said she called it the gold standard. She said no. Guess what? She called it the gold standard. And Lester Holt didn't correct her. I wonder why. <BOOING> The Trans-Pacific Partnership will economically devastate Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and so many other states all across this country. It will be devastating also for Ohio. Hillary Clinton's donors want the TPP, and their wish will be her command. That's what it is. The special interests pay her for speeches. And she's not a good speaker. Not a good speaker. They pay her a lot of money. You know, we have thousands of people here today. There are thousands and thousands of people outside trying to get in. Thousands. <APPLAUSE> And they're coming. And, in fact, I was going to ask you, should we hold it up for a couple of hours, let everyone pour in? You know, they're all checked. The answer is no, right? Thank you. No, they'll get in. They pay her foundation. They pay her husband. In return, they get your jobs. Like I've been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is remember these words: Follow the money. That's good. <APPLAUSE> That's become very popular, I will say. Hillary Clinton praised or pushed TPP on 45 separate occasions. Her close associate and confidante, Governor Terry McAuliffe, said she'd pass it, don't worry. Her husband talks it up. Everyone knows she's for it, because she doesn't believe in protecting American jobs or American sovereignty. She doesn't believe it. Hillary Clinton only believes in protecting her special interests and her donors. Of the 262 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP, 82, or nearly 1 in 3, donated between $21 million and $67 million to the Clinton Foundation. Think about it. <BOOING> Nine companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP paid Hillary Clinton $2.7 million for paid speeches. Who would want to hear Hillary Clintons peak and pay her $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000? Who? You think so? <BOOING> You know, so we're going to have $20,000 people here easy, including outside much more than that. If she came here tomorrow, if she got 500 people, seriously, I think it would be a shock. Right? It would be a shock. Three TPP member countries gave between $6 million and $15 million. Think of that. At least four lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign. On November 8th, we are going to end Clinton corruption. We've had enough. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to do something that has been a long, long time in coming. We are going to put America first. We are going to put America first. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors. I'm an outsider fighting for you. We have a movement like they've never seen in this country before. The corrupt media, which is totally corrupt -- these people back there, totally corrupt... <BOOING> Working along with the political establishment and the establishment is panicking, because they know this is awfully tough to stop what's happening right now, folks. Awfully tough. <APPLAUSE> The news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help crooked Hillary Clinton and cling to their power and their prestige and their money. The arrogant political class doesn't believe in protecting jobs and wages for Americans. You know, we have many people in the audience -- and all over the country -- that made more money in real wages 18 and 20 years ago than they're making now. And now because of Obamacare and other reasons, they're being forced to work two jobs, sometimes three jobs. So they're getting older. They're working harder. And they're being paid less. Not good. The only thing I can say is that I'm getting older and I'm working harder, also, OK? So... <APPLAUSE> I'm putting myself in your category. It's true.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Oh, that's so true, though, isn't it? The special interests don't believe in secure borders and strong walls. The Washington and Wall Street insiders don't believe in hiring more police, producing more American energy, or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools. And we are, by the way, going to end Common Core and bring education local. <APPLAUSE> For decades, we've talked about the corruption and incompetence and failures of our leaders. In 2016 -- it's a long awaited chance to deliver the change that you've been waiting for, for a long time, and to hold our politicians accountable. If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system. On November 8th, show up and vote. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Show up and vote, folks. Show up and vote. If you are so sick, if you get the worst report you could possibly get for the doctor, if the doctor says, ""I'm sorry, Jim, I'm sorry, Alice, I'm sorry, whoever it is, you're not going to make it, you're not going to make it, you'll be gone by the end of November,"" I don't give a damn. Show up and vote on November 8th. <APPLAUSE> No, we don't want that to happen. We don't want that to happen. When you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding your country and your city and every place else, and imagine the look on their faces when you tell them you're fired. Fired. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to tell millions and millions of unemployed Americans my favorite two words: You're hired. <APPLAUSE> When we get it going, folks, millions of jobs are going to come pouring back into our country. We're going to reverse the trend. Right now, we have a superhighway. It goes in one direction: Out of our country. Our jobs are gone. Our money's gone. Our wealth is gone. We owe $20 trillion. Obama has doubled the debt, doubled it, in his term in office, $20 trillion. <BOOING> And we haven't done anything. Our roads are bad. Our schools are bad. Our airports are bad. Our hospitals are bad. Our bridges, our tunnels, they're all falling apart. You know, it's one thing if we would have spent the money and fixed our country. We've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East. We could have rebuilt our country twice. Now the media doesn't want to talk about Hillary Clinton and her corruption. So we're going to spell it out for them today. <APPLAUSE> The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas and out of our country, they're donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class, they're donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy, they're donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton. Definitely follow the money. In her campaign for president, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds. And by the way... <BOOING> By the way, I'm spending a lot of money on my campaign. And why isn't she spending some money on hers? I'm spending $100 million. You know what I'm spending? I think I'll be over $100 million. But you know what's nice? When they call me and they say, ""Mr. President, you have to do this, you have to do that,"" I'll say, ""I don't have to do anything for anybody!"" <APPLAUSE> The only one that I'm working for is you. That's the only one. You watch. <APPLAUSE> So many things are done adverse to the country, and I've spent a tremendous -- tens and tens of millions of dollars on the primaries and now on the general election. And I'm very proud to have done it, I will tell you. And I don't know to this extent if it's ever been done before. Certainly not recently. But I'm very proud to have done it, because we're going to maintain our independence. We have millions and millions of dollars coming in from small donors, average -- like $61 a shot. And that's really helping to fund the campaign, also. But these are people who are investing in our country. These are great, great people. They're investing in our country. So Hillary and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill Clinton left the Oval Office, $150 million. <BOOING> Did they get their money's worth? Well, maybe they did. Not from the speech. The same groups are paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches, these were the groups that were lobbying in many cases the federal government. I'm shocked. Twenty-two groups paid Bill Clinton for speeches, lobbied the State Department, while Hillary was secretary of state. Shocking. Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks. She put the office of secretary of state up for sale and she never, ever got the chance, and she will get the chance if we don't get out to vote. She will get the chance. And we can't let that happen. Because if she gets the chance, she will put the Oval Office up for sale like she always does. <BOOING> Remember, folks, she's been doing this for 30 years and she -- she just doesn't produce. She deleted and bleached 33,000 e-mails after a congressional subpoena. You can't do that. <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> After the subpoena. How about this? You get a federal subpoena, you get a subpoena from Congress, I mean, how high can it get? To give your e-mails, to give your papers, to give everything. It isn't before you get the subpoena. This is after you get the subpoena. And after you get the subpoena, you delete and bleach, a process nobody ever heard of -- who heard of that in this room? Did anybody ever hear of it? They call it bleaching. They call it acid washing. And a lot of people don't do it, because it's supposed to be very expensive. But nobody heard of it. So she gets the subpoena. She doesn't like it. She says, in my opinion, or somebody does, but she says, ""Delete all of my e-mails! Delete them!"" And then she said, and by the way, is there another process where they can never find them? Yes, ma'am, we can bleach them. Then bleach them. Because I don't want anybody to see the wedding and the yoga classes, right? She said there were wedding and yoga class tweets. I give five for the wedding and three for the yoga class, but what about the rest? In addition, she got rid of 13 phones that were missing or gone. And several were destroyed by a hammer. Whoever destroyed your phone with a hammer? Is there anybody? There's one person -- what business are you in? <LAUGHTER> Foreign enemies with easy access to hack -- and, believe me, she's vulnerable, and she makes us vulnerable, because foreign enemies -- you look at her server, and they're probably hacking her all over the place. Unfortunately, maybe we'll find out at a later date. Lies to Congress under oath. She lies to Congress. How many times did she lie to Congress? And then the media protects her, and they don't talk about that. And if I'm a little bit off, ""Trump lies, lies."" She lied to Congress so many times. <BOOING> And how about her people and representatives taking the Fifth Amendment and her ringleaders getting immunity deals, five deals, five? Five immunity deals. We call them now the FBI immunity five. So listen to this. Listen to this. Here's my question for Hillary Clinton. Can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton administration if that ever happens? Oh, would that be bad. <BOOING> Let's see what happens. And here's the demand I'm making today to President Obama. <BOOING> Mr. President, will you pledge not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her coconspirators for their many crimes against our country and against society itself? Will you make that pledge? <APPLAUSE> No one is above the law. Clinton and her cronies will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power, to keep their control over our country. Remember the Clinton pardon of fugitive -- and this was a serious fugitive -- Marc Rich in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money? You remember that? Marc Rich. Famous Marc Rich. People couldn't believe it. The American people have had it with years or decades of Clinton corruption and scandals. Always the same thing. Whitewater, the cattle. Remember the cattle? I think she had the greatest return on a cattle investment in the history of the cattle world. Guys that did it all their lives, they said, wow, she must know a lot about cattle. The people of this country are tired of the lies. They're tired of trivial politics. They're tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second-class citizens. <APPLAUSE> This will finally be the year that the American people say, ""Enough is enough."" <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for the African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton. They're too smart, and they know they are being used. They're tired of them. <APPLAUSE> They also know from tremendous past experience that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over. She never does, and that will never change. Many of them will not forget her calling young African-American men super predators. <BOOING> Super predator. To the African-American community, let me ask you this question. Are you better off than you were eight years ago? No. If not, why not give Donald Trump a chance? I will fix it. <APPLAUSE> I will bring back jobs. I'll bring back your education, which is a total disaster in the inner cities. And I'm going to bring back safe neighborhoods. <APPLAUSE> If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the exact same results. Look at what the Democrats have done to Detroit. Half of Detroit residents are unable to work. Nearly 40 percent of the city lives in poverty. It's the second-most dangerous city in America according to the FBI. This is the legacy of the policies embraced by crooked Hillary Clinton. A Trump administration will bring prosperity to all of our people. My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: Jobs, jobs, jobs. We're bringing our jobs back. <APPLAUSE> We're going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. And by the way, Hillary Clinton is going to raise your taxes. Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be immediately eliminated. They're choking our businesses and stopping our jobs. We will unleash the power of American energy. The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced. <APPLAUSE> And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, that have caused so much pain in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and everywhere in this country will be renegotiated and we'll be bring back your auto manufacturing business like you've never, ever seen it before. <APPLAUSE> Michigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO, another Bill Clinton disaster. Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 autoworkers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000, and believe me, it's going down and going down fast. And after the election, if somebody else should win, you're going to see really big reductions in those numbers. I can promise you that, because that's what they're going to do. <BOOING> And I've been talking about Michigan. I was honored here years ago -- and we set the all-time record years ago, long before I ever thought I was going to be doing this -- whoever thought I was going to run for office? I was going to be a politician. Can't believe -- somebody said, Donald, you're a politician. I said, please, I don't want to hear that. But whoever thought? But long before I thought about doing this, I was honored in Michigan, and I talked about your car industries moving out. And had I run for office then and won, you would have double and triple the number of workers in your car industry, your automobile industry. I'll guarantee you that. But we'll get them back anyway. Ford just announced that it's moving its small car production to Mexico. <BOOING> So it used to be that the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint. <APPLAUSE> That's what's happened to our country. Hillary Clinton also gave us the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, which has been a disaster. It's cost our country another 100,000 jobs. And Hillary opposed the Korea deal when she was running for president in 2007. She campaigned right here in Michigan and said the Korean deal will hurt the United States auto industry, increase our trade deficit, cost us good middle-class jobs, and make America less competitive. She pledged to you to reject the deal, but she lied, as always. She lied. <BOOING> Once installed as secretary of state, she supported it and called it a cutting-edge transaction. <BOOING> Same thing's going to happen with TPP. Don't give her the chance, folks. You're going to lose all your jobs. Don't forget, when she ran for the Senate in New York state, she said she was going to bring back jobs in upstate New York. It was a total lie. We lost more and more jobs, and today it's a total disaster. She rammed it through as she always tries to do. Her donors were happy. They were all extremely friendly to her. They helped her out. Everybody was satisfied except for the workers of our country. We lost our jobs. The U.S. trade deficit with Korea for the top 10 products that Michigan exports to Korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose. So it was an exact opposite of what she said. And she probably knew it, although I personally think she's incompetent. She might not have known it. Don't forget, she has a distinction. She failed her bar exam in Washington, D.C. Remember that. That's a big distinction. This is what Hillary Clinton did for your state. According to the Economic Policy Institute, Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. OK? <BOOING> Just imagine how many more jobs will be lost if the TPP actually gets approved, as Hillary Clinton wants to make sure it happens. Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the Internet, which is happening now. <BOOING> How about Obama? How about Obama? Wants to give the Internet, let it be given to the world. <BOOING> What a bunch of people we have representing us. What a bunch of people. See how nice I'm doing? You know? A year ago, I would have said something vicious and they would have said, ""Donald Trump uses foul language."" What a group we have. How about where Obama on the worst deal that I've ever seen negotiated, the Iran deal, started by Hillary Clinton, by the way, which will give them nuclear weapons in less than 10 years, and it's an easy path, but how about where he gave them $400 million in cash? <BOOING> And then it turned out to be wrong. It was $1.7 billion in cash. Can you believe it? You know what that is? It's take that corner of the room and stack the cash to the ceiling. Nobody's seen that. Has anybody ever seen $1.7 billion in cash? What a bunch of losers we have. Hillary Clinton's website says she supports the decision to give away the Internet to a global community of stakeholders. Isn't that nice? We come up with the Internet, and they want to give it away. Isn't that wonderful? Someone needs to inform Hillary Clinton it's not the job of our leaders to represent the global community. <APPLAUSE> It's the job of our leaders to represent American citizens. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> We invent the Internet. Let's just give it away, folks. Let's just give it away. But it really is -- honestly, is it hard to believe or what? Forget about running for office. Forget about voting. Forget about politics. Can you believe the things they do? $400 million, oh, turns out to be $1.7 billion, in cash. The Internet. How about last week where they were going to deport 800 people? Now they have a reason they were going to deport them. Right? So they were going to deport 800 people. And guess what? Something went wrong. And instead of deporting them, they became citizens of the United States of America. <BOOING> Only in America. Don King, who supported me, Big Don, he goes, only in America can that happen. But they were wrong. But there was a mistake. There was a mistake. It turned out that the 800 person number was wrong. It looks like it's now going to be close to 1,800. <BOOING> And then I said, OK, they made a big mistake. Let's turn it around and let's deport them. And they said, but that wouldn't be constitutional. Can you believe these people? Can you? Can you believe these people? America losing control of the Internet to foreign entities is just one more way Obama-Clinton have sold out the citizens of this country. Somebody's benefiting by that deal, because nobody can be so stupid to make a deal like that. Somebody is benefiting by that deal. Hillary Clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the American people. I'm not running to be president of the world. I'm running to be president of the United States of America. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never, ever seem to happen? The reason is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media, which is one of the most dishonest groups of people ever in this country... <BOOING> Like, for instance, look at this massive crowd. They don't show the crowd, folks. I go home. My wife said, oh, were there many people? I say thousands. She goes, really? I didn't see them. I didn't see them. They don't show them. Hey, cameras, why don't you span the room and show the room, cameras? Span the room. <APPLAUSE> They won't do it. They won't do it. They never do it. They never do it. They're dishonest people.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Dishonest people. I remember during the primaries -- I remember during the primaries when Bernie Sanders was doing well, he made a terrible deal. He sold out to the devil, you know that? And now people don't even want to show up for Bernie. He sold out. He should have never made that deal. He should have gone down. He would have been an American hero. He sold out to Hillary Clinton. He sold out to the devil, and his people don't want anything to do with him. He had an event the other day. Almost nobody showed up. But I remember when he was hot and he was getting big crowds. And I had an event at the same time a little different location. I had 17,000 people. He had 3,000 people. And the media reported it. And they said, Donald Trump had a rally tonight. And then he started falling asleep, 17,000. Then they reported on Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders had a massive crowd of 3,000 people tonight, 3,000 people. You know what 3,000 people is? It's like a little piece of that corner of the room. <APPLAUSE> So for him -- it's true. So for crazy Bernie, they had a little -- for me, they don't want to report it. But that's OK, because we understand what's happening. Just as long as you know how dishonest these people are. And boy were they dishonest on the debate. Man. They were -- there's never been dishonesty. And by the way, by the way, it was just announced by the commission that holds the debate that Donald Trump's microphone was defective, as I've been saying. <BOOING> I mean, working that microphone was a hell of a lot more difficult than working crooked Hillary Clinton. That I can tell you. They just announced -- it just came out a little while ago, that the microphone in the audience, the big room, was defective. And it was not -- it was difficult. And, you know, when you have a situation like that, and you know it's bad, and you think you have 100 million people watching, what do you do, stop the show? Please fix it. It was bad. I wonder why it was bad. Think of that. I wonder why it was bad. It was so bad. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and has never done anything for you or your family, and she never will. Just look how badly she messed up the Iran deal. And just today, we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released, the United States signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two Iranian banks involved in financing Iran's missile program. <BOOING> And you know where they want those missiles to eventually land, don't you, folks? Huh? Right here. Right here. Right here in this country. That's where they want them to land. And they're taunting us with the boats. They're taunting us with the 10 sailors they captured. They're taunting us by flying right next to our airplanes. So we give them all this money, $150 billion back. We give them the deal of a lifetime. And instead of saying thank you, they feel emboldened. That won't happen with us, folks. So just think of what I said before, the way she failed upstate New York, the way she promised all those jobs that never happened. Our campaign is taking on big business. We're taking on big media. And it's not pleasant. I have never, ever in my life received stories like I receive now. I mean, it is called the greatest pile-on in the history of America. Even journalists that don't like me say it's the craziest thing they've ever seen. But I'm doing it -- I'm doing it everybody. Who knows? I'm doing it for everybody. Doing it for you. <APPLAUSE> Our campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable. You're deplorable and irredeemable, she says. <BOOING> See, she doesn't know you like I know you. You are the smartest people. We're the strongest people. We're the most loyal people ever to be involved in a campaign. <APPLAUSE> I call you hardworking American patriots. And together, we are going to save this country. And we're not going to have a second chance, folks. If we don't do it on November 8th, it's not going to happen. I don't believe -- if we have to have Barack Obama but worse for four more years, I honestly believe our country can never recovery. And remember, Supreme Court judges. Remember that. But together, we can accomplish anything we want. But that means you need to show up on November 8th. We have 39 days until the election. You have 39 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true. Do not let this opportunity slip away. Get out and vote and make sure everything is on the up-and-up. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Make sure everything is on the up-and-up. You've been reading the same stories as I've been reading. So go to your place and vote and go pick some other place and go sit there with your friends and make sure it's on the up-and-up. Because you know what? That's a big, big problem in this country, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places. Make sure it's on the up-and-up. Please. <APPLAUSE> That would be one hell of a way to lose, I'll tell you right now. You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice. For every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation -- and there are a lot -- the arrogance of Washington, D.C., will soon come face-to-face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. <APPLAUSE> November 8th, we're going to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> In summing up, here are just some of the great things that will happen for your country. We're going to lower your taxes substantially. She's going to raise your taxes. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary regulation. She is going to add regulation. We're going to repeal and replace job- killing Obamacare. We're going to make childcare affordable. We're bringing childcare into the picture. My daughter, Ivanka, wants it, and I want it. <APPLAUSE> We're going to bring manufacturing jobs -- we're going to bring those automobile jobs back to Michigan, and I mean back fast. <APPLAUSE> We're going to eliminate Common Core. We're going to bring education local. <APPLAUSE> We will end illegal immigration. We will keep... <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!>
<TRUMP:> We will build the wall. And who's going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico will!>
<TRUMP:> One hundred percent. Mexico's going to pay for the wall. They just don't know it yet. But trust me, they're going to pay for it. <APPLAUSE> We have such a trade deficit with Mexico. I was in Mexico. I really like the president. I love the country. I love the people in Mexico. I have so many Mexicans that work for me. They're friends of mine. These are great people. But their leaders are so much smarter than our leaders. We have a trade deficit that is massive with Mexico. The wall is a tiny fraction of what we're talking about. So when people say, how are they going to do it? I say look at the trade deficit. Look at the cost of the wall. And even the politicians that have no clue what's happening, they say, oh, now I get it. But they could never produce it. So we're going to have the wall. And we're going to stop drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth. <APPLAUSE> We're going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> We are going to save the Second Amendment, which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> We are going to take care of our inner cities, our African- American communities, our Hispanic communities. We're going to make them good again. We're going to make them safe again. <APPLAUSE> We are going to support the men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to appoint justices to the Supreme Court of the United States who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> We will rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our highways. We will rebuild so beautifully our airports, our schools, and our hospitals. American cars made right here in Michigan will travel the roads. American planes will soar the skies. And American ships will patrol the sea. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. And we will take care of our steelworkers. And we will take care of our miners. We'll going to take care of our miners and our steelworkers. <APPLAUSE> American hands will rebuild this nation. And American energy mined from American sources will power this nation again. <APPLAUSE> American workers, many of you in this room, will be hired to do the job. And these will be great jobs. We will put new American steel into the spine of our country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation, and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag. <APPLAUSE> To the people of Michigan, I promise you this. You get out, and you vote on November 8th for Donald J. Trump for president, you'll be voting for yourselves, because our movement will be complete phase one. Phase two is we will make America wealthy and rich again. Got to do it. <APPLAUSE> We will make America strong again. <APPLAUSE> We will make America safe again. <APPLAUSE> And we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-03"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Oh look at this. Boy, what a -- what a response from our greatest people. Thank you very much. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Well, at least I definitely know the military likes Trump, right? That's great, it's -- you're amazing people, are <ph> great people and I very much appreciate it. And speaking of that, we will have this week over 200 admirals and generals endorsing Trump, and that to me is a fantastic honor. In addition, we had 17, now we have 19 folks Congressional Medal of Honor recipients. And to have that many is very unusual and a tremendous honor. I've met many of them over the last two weeks and that, to me, is just a great honor. So I wanna thank everybody -- I wanna thank everybody in this room. And it's a privilege to be here this morning with you. So many distinguished members of our services, and that's really what you are, very, very highly distinguished members. Before we get started, we're going to have a Q&amp;A. In a little while, I'd like to address one of the most important aspects of America's national security, and that's cyber security. To truly make America safe, we must make cyber security a major priority, which I don't believe we're doing right now, for both government and the private sector. Cyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States by far. As president, improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my administration. One of the very first things I will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses. We have very substantial weaknesses, including all vital infrastructures. Cyber attacks from foreign governments, especially China, Russia, North Korea along with non-state terrorist actors and organized criminal groups constitute one of our most critical national security concerns. They're leaning everything about us and we don't have -- wanna have any servers in the basements, by the way folks. Has anybody here... <LAUGHTER> Has anybody in this group -- I know our congressmen hasn't done it, has anybody put a server in their basement? Oh boy, Hillary Clinton's only -- Hillary Clinton's only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive cover up and putting the entire nation in harm's way.
<TRUMP:> The fact that a former senator and secretary of state claimed not to know what the letter C means is just one more example of why she is totally unfit to hold the office of president. Totally unfit. <APPLAUSE> It's interesting that during her FBI review, which took place on a massive holiday and which wasn't recorded and lots of other things, that she went 39 times. She didn't remember, she didn't remember. She doesn't remember anything. She remembered practically nothing. But when she has to remember something, she remembers. It's a very sad situation, I will tell you. I'm sure the folks in this room are not thrilled. The scope of our cybersecurity problem is enormous. Our government, our businesses, our trade secrets and our citizens' most sensitive information are all facing constant cyberattacks and reviews <ph> by the enemy. Just consider some of these recent hacks, JPMorgan Chase, massive bank, had 73 million e-mails stolen. eBay was involved and gave up 150 million passwords. Target was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbers. Attacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the United States and around the world, and the costs in terms of privacy, our security and our financial sector are truly extraordinary. Identity theft, financial laundering, as well as ransom and ransomware -- I mean, think of it -- all involving extortion of a hacked institution are becoming increasingly common. They are extorting institutions. Incredibly, hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who under FBI background and were under FBI background investigations. The information hack contains facts discovered by the FBI in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the federal government. It's a treasure trove which can easily be used for blackmail and other reasons by the enemy. The fact that this highly classified information of very, very important people in many cases was so poorly protected demonstrates that cybersecurity is just one more area where the Obama administration has failed. And speaking of failure, when we do our question and answer period, you look at what's happened with our navy in terms of the number of ships and our armed forces generally, how they are so depleted, how they are at almost record-setting lows and in some cases absolute record-setting lows, it is very, very unfortunate and very, very dangerous for our country. We should not let this be like the history of the Mafia, which was allowed to grow into a nationwide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long period of time. We can learn from this history, that when the Department of Justice, the FBI, the DEA and the state and local police and prosecutors were combined in a task force directed by and at the Mafia, when they looked at the Mafia and really went after them, they were able to get great great successes and prosecutions out of them and seizing their business interests, did a lot of things, including their business interests, taking them away and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society. They've been very, very effective when everybody got together. That was a long time ago.
<TRUMP:> As president, I will instruct the Department of Justice to create a joint task force throughout the United States to work together with federal, state and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this still-developing area of crime. And it's getting bigger very fast. It's gonna be harder and harder to do. I will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense and in every other way, by the way, every other way. <APPLAUSE> We've rarely needed it more than we do right now. I will also ask my secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our Cyber Command. As a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources, the United States must possess -- and has to -- the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter attacks. And I mean crippling, crippling. This is the warfare of the future. America's dominance in this arena must be unquestioned. And today, it's totally questioned. People don't even know if we have the capability that we're supposed to have when you look at what's going on with other countries. Cybersecurity is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies, as well. For non-state terror actors, the United States must develop the ability, no matter how difficult, to track down and incapacitate those responsible and do it rapidly. We should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists. And they have to know its coming because right now, they know nothing about us. It just seems they have an open blanket. It's like an open mark, do whatever you wanna do, nothing's gonna happen. Take our youth out of the country, infiltrate our country in so many different ways. We can't let this happen. We have to have it stopped immediately before it's too late. <APPLAUSE> To enhance the defense of the other agencies of government, including our law enforcement agencies -- so important, they're doing such a great job, by the way -- we will put together a team of our best military, civilian and private sector cybersecurity experts to comprehensively review all of our cybersecurity systems and technologies. The cyber review team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first, but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits. And hopefully, that's gonna be our technology. We will also require that follow-up reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved. The review will be very much exact and recommended by experts. We want experts, our finest people. We don't want people that are B level, C level, D level. We have to get our absolute best and the recommendations have to be a combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies and every other discipline involved. This will include the various methods of internal monitoring, attack and penetration, investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees -- and you have plenty of rogue employees -- and identity protection for government employees. The review team will also remain current on the constantly evolving new methods of attack and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before breaches occur.
<TRUMP:> And there are ways of doing this through modern technology, but we are not using that, and frankly, our technology is not up to date. We're letting it slip by. And with technology, as we know, it can go very, very rapidly. This group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials, requiring them to follow best and strongest practices. They will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain that they understand what defenses are available and utilize them, along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense. That means attack and defense. Those who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law, something which we don't do too much anymore. <APPLAUSE> You know, in our country lately, we're more interested in protecting the criminals than we are in making sure that we're strong and powerful and know what we're doing. We're so, so interested in protecting criminals and people that want to do us harm and I think we have to go back to a little more old-fashioned method of thinking, if that makes sense. I will appoint an attorney general who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate. My attorney general will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice, which has been severely questioned. Today is just... <APPLAUSE> Frankly, nobody's every seen anything like what's happening today. When you have somebody getting a subpoena from the United States Congress to have your e-mails and all other information sent, and after -- not before, after getting the subpoena, 33,000 e-mails are deleted and acid washed. And nobody even knows what that means, acid wash. It's a very expensive thing to do. Most people don't even know what it means. When you see something like that, and there's no crime, everything's just wonderful. You know, if you were in a private case with Mr. Smith and they call for your records and you get rid of your records so blatantly as this, you have serious consequences. Like, the most serious consequences. The congressman sends out a tremendous subpoena, they want to see the e-mails, and they delete the e-mails. I can't think of anything, in terms of we're talking about, much more serious than that. Congressman, do you agree? It's hard to believe. Hard to believe that they can get away with this kind of thing. Today is just to the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion on how to protect ourselves from modern cyber crime and evolving national security threats and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century. We need the edge, and ideally, a big one.
<TRUMP:> I want to thank everybody in this room. I have such respect for the people in this room for being here, and now let's begin our discussion. Thank you very much, folks. Thank you. <APPLAUSE>
<UNKNOWN: Mr. Trump, thank you so much for joining us today and I know you are busy traveling but I want to thank you for taking the opportunity to have a conversation with these American warriors (ph) and I first want to thank General Vernon Lewis whose idea was to pull all of these leaders together. We want to thank him for his leadership. (APPLAUSE) Before we begin, Mr. Trump, I just want to kind of give you an overview of who's in this room. We have gathered here warriors from across America who have fought and defended America and the ideals upon which America is founded in every conflict and war since World War II. They are in this room here today. They have retired and hung up their uniforms but they have not retired from their defending of their oath and that is to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic. And they are here today in service to their country. (APPLAUSE) So, with that understanding that you have a room full of warriors who are ready to report for duty to defend this country, we want to begin with our questions and General Boykin will recognize our first general to ask a question.>
<MODERATOR: Well, I'd like to say thank you for being here as well. Our first speaker probably has seen more combat than anybody else in the room here because he's fought in three wars. It's General Frederick or Fritz Kroesen. He was in World War II, Korea, as well as Vietnam. He commanded everything from the company to the corps level and ultimately earned three Purple Hearts and three Combat Infantry Badges. He is -- he had three four-star jobs, he was commanding general of the forces command, the vice chief of staff for the Army, and the commander in chief of the United States Army Europe. General Kroesen, your question, sir. (APPLAUSE)>
<QUESTION: Is this on? I'm on. Mr. Trump, I only speak for the Army. It's not because I ignore the needs of the Air Force and the Navy but -- and I accept everything you have said about the cyber threat to us but my question has to do with the United States Army which has been too small ever since the Cold War ended and we paid the peace dividend out of the defense budget and the Army has been too small ever since. When we were committed into Iraq and Afghanistan and the chief of staff of the Army was asked how many troops he was going to need to finish that war and he said ""about 300,000"" he was made a pariah and no one asked for his advice and counsel for the rest of his tour duty. We've been using that army for the last 15 years and it's the first time we ever went to war without expanding the size of the army. Instead of that, they hired 200,000 civilian contractors to do the work that the Army wasn't big enough to do. Now we have an Army that's being worn out. We are losing experienced soldiers who are being left -- being dismissed from the Army in order to bring the size down even more.>
<QUESTION: Now, we think the United States Army is gonna be a major element that you'll want to use in your national strategy. And we'd like to know what your thoughts are on how to go about this.>
<TRUMP:> Well, General, thank you. And thank you for your bravery, amazing. I've heard your name mentioned many times, so thank you for being here and thank you for the question. Not only the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, everything is going away at a time when certainly we are at a top priority for making sure that doesn't happen. We're not respected to the extent that we were. And if we keep going like this, we won't be respected at all. You look at Russia's doing with their nuclear capability and the newness of their capability, and look at we're -- what we're doing, and nobody wants to do that with respect to nukes because nukes are horrible. But you have countries that are going out of their way to do things that we're not doing. And we have to be very, very careful. The size of the Army, absolutely it's getting too small. In fact a certain general, when he left about a year and a half ago said we are not only too small, we're the least prepared that we've ever been since he can remember -- the least prepared. So, it's a combination of that -- of both. Look, I feel so strongly that I use a different word in going around that our forces are depleted -- they're depleted. We have the greatest people on Earth, but they're depleted. You see where the fighter jets are so old that they can't get parts anymore. They have to go to plane -- airplane graveyards and museums to get parts for our fighter jets that we're currently using. They don't make the parts. And you have other countries that have brand new equipment. And in some cases, we sell them the equipment. The whole thing is ridiculous. Now, we're gonna build up our forces, including the Army. But we are gonna build up our forces. We have no choice. You know, they can talk about sequester, they can talk about all of the different things that they've -- they're doing. But this isn't like we have a choice. This is something where -- and we're gonna be cutting elements of government certainly. But when it comes to the military, we have no choice. We cannot have a depleted military. We have to have the strongest military by far. And with that being said, as you know, we spend a lot of money on protecting other countries. And yet, those other countries aren't paying nearly what it costs us for that protection. Where -- they're getting one of the great bargains of all time. But we're spending on numerous countries, very substantial countries. You know the countries we're talking about. But we're defending them for a fraction of the cost. We have to go to those countries and we have to ask them to make contributions that are greater than the contributions they're making right now. You know, we're gonna protect them. We're gonna remain loyal to them. But at the same time, it's a two-way street. They have to help us also. So I think your question is a great one. We will build our military forces to a level that will be, I believe, stronger than ever before if I become president of the United States. OK? Thank you. <APPLAUSE>
<MODERATOR: Earlier, before you arrived, we mentioned today is the anniversary of the Black Hawk Down in Mogadishu. And one of the officers that was there that we recognized is going to ask our second question, Major General Gary Harrell.>
<MODERATOR: General Harrell has had multiple tours with the 82nd Airborne Division, has been on combat missions from Panama to Somalia. He was a commander of the U.S. Special Operations Forces in CENTCOM and led the first special forces into Afghanistan. He retired in 2008 from the United States Army Special Operations Command. General Harrell. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Hello, General.
<QUESTION: Hello, sir. The Obama administration has yet to develop a strategy for dealing with the global jihad movement. The terrorists are motivated by theology that drives them to atrocities against non-believers, be they Christians, Jews or other faiths. Americans have not been allowed to know the enemy or call them by name. We need a strategy, not a tactical plan. What is your plan to defeat radical Islam? And how will you reverse the strategic confusion of the Obama era?>
<TRUMP:> Well, it is confusion not only there, but it's confusion in many other fields long beyond military and defense. The country's confused in terms of even the divide in our country. We have such a divide and really divides, we have many different forms of divides. So there's a lot of confusion. But we have a president that won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism, won't use it. Will spend long periods of time explaining to people why he won't use it. At the end of the explanation, nobody knows why he still won't use it because the explanation is no good. And I mean, honestly we have a president that in my opinion really doesn't know what he's doing. We have a president that doesn't know what's happening, and when it comes to the military, you know, I always say, keep the oil. I said don't go in, but I said keep the oil. Had we kept the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, because they fuel their growth with the oil. But I read something and saw something over the weekend that really bothered me because I believe in -- I'm a big fan of General Douglas MacArthur and General George Patton, and you know, these great generals, some of the generals -- big fan of some of the generals in this room. We have -- General Flynn is with us and General Kellogg. We have a few generals that have been so incredible to me. Now we have 200. But generals and admirals. I'm never gonna forget admirals, right? Those admirals <ph>. I will never forget the admirals. That I can promise you. But it was very disconcerting when I saw that an attack is planned on Mosul, an attack is planned. And you know, we're involved in the attack, but the Iraqi forces are planning an attack on Mosul. It should happen over a short period of time and the work will be -- why do we have to talk about it? Why? I never saw anything like this. Every time we are going to attack somebody, we explain. We're going to attack, we'll be attacking at three, noon on March 25th. I don't know, unless you disagree with me, wouldn't it be better if we were going to go after Mosul to not say anything and do it, as opposed to announcing -- they're announcing all over television they're planning to attack Mosul. <APPLAUSE> And whenever they asked me the question about what are you going to do about ISIS, I say, you know, I have a real chance of winning. I don't really want to tell you. I have very strong ideas and I'll be dealing with the people in this room and other folks that are, you know, very good at this, but the last thing you want to do is give notice to the enemy. When President Obama announced that he was leaving Iraq, I mean, he was talking about dates and times and what we're going to do.
<TRUMP:> The enemy pulls back. We think we're doing well. Well, they pull back. They're not stupid. And then after we leave, you see what happened. So I just -- I just want to say that we are going to hit ISIS hard, and I mean really hard, but I do think this. The American public doesn't have to know the date and hour and second that we're going to attack and from what side we're going to attack. We're going to attack from the eastern quadrant and it'll take place on a certain day, at a certain hour. We don't need to -- they just want to see victory. We don't have victory. I mean, we're dropping our -- we're dropping things all over the place. Who knows what they're hitting. Who knows how many people are being killed and who knows if they're the right people. But at some point, we have to stop a force that's going out and drowning people in steel cages and chopping off heads. These are barbaric people. These are people that -- you know, I used to study medieval times, and you know, they chopped off heads. But until recently, this was a phenomena that you wouldn't see, the level of barbarism is unbelievable. So we're gonna stop them, we're gonna stop them cold. We're gonna stop them very powerfully. But I don't think all of us should be -- unless it's a very confined room, we shouldn't be giving up our plans and it bothers me every time I see where we're planning to attack this one, that one. But the one I saw over the weekend was Mosul and they're talking about attacking. The other problem is, you have a lot of the leaders in Mosul. Well, they're not gonna be there, they're getting out because they hear they're gonna be attacked, so they're getting out, they're going some place <ph>. Congressman, would you agree with this? If I'm a leader and I'm seeing and I'm watching what everybody else is watching and an attack on Mosul is imminent, I'm saying bye folks, have a good time I'm moving into a different city. <LAUGHTER> So what are they doing? Can there be allowed -- are we allowed to have any more in the military, General, the element of surprise? You know, I would think it would be a good thing. It's called an ancient strength and we don't use it anymore.
<MODERATOR: Principle of war. >
<TRUMP:> I think its one of the great principles. The element of surprise, I mean, you could take a force that's not nearly as strong and with the element of surprise you could wipe out a much more powerful force. And I don't pretend to be a general or an admiral or anything else, but I just -- every time I see -- I see President Obama get up, ""Ladies and gentleman, we are sending 50 people to Iraq,"" 50. So that's bad in two ways. Number one, it's such a low number that the enemy's saying is that all? <LAUGHTER> And number two, when you think 50, those people now have a target on their back. They wanna find those 50 people and they look for those 50 people. When Hillary Clinton says no boots on the ground, now, whether you want boots on the ground or not you shouldn't say it because you've just taken -- so she said there will be no boots on the ground, she's very strong <ph> because politics, you know, it sounds a little bit better to say no boots on the ground. But by doing that, she has empowered the enemy, she's empowered the enemy. And I think she possibly means it, I'm not sure if she means it or not. But she says no boots on the ground. She has taken a tremendous -- I mean, that's really giving strength to the enemy. And even if she felt that, she should never admit that. She should never admit that. You have to leave all your options open. And if you don't leave your options open, you're a fool. And I hated to hear her say that.
<MODERATOR: So... (APPLAUSE) To summarize, you're not going to send a message about date and time, but you are going to send a message that their days are numbered?>
<TRUMP:> Their days -- their days will be numbered very quickly. <APPLAUSE>
<MODERATOR: OK. Our third question is asked by our Rear Admiral Frank Gallo. Admiral Gallo is a retired naval aviator with 35 years service. He has hundreds of carrier landings, flew almost every fixed wing aircraft in the Navy in his time.>
<MODERATOR: He was commander to the squadron wing and fleet wing levels and he was chief of Naval Personnel Command for the Department of the Navy. Admiral Gallo. (APPLAUSE)>
<QUESTION: Mr. Trump, I'm happy you haven't forgotten the admirals, of course.>
<TRUMP:> I will never.
<QUESTION: And I hope you'll pardon the remnants...>
<TRUMP:> I don't have the courage to do that. <LAUGHTER>
<QUESTION: I hope you'll pardon the remnants of a Brooklyn accent. The Department of Veterans Affairs has a horrible record of taking care of veterans. As you recall, there was a -- there were lengthy lines at V.A. hospitals, substandard medical care and falsified medical records and accounting. Leadership changes and new unrealistic laws have failed to correct the problems. The V.A. is the most -- probably the most ineffective bureaucracy in all of Washington and it is time for drastic action. The question is, with the near daily revelations that the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs fails veterans in some form or another, what is your plan to reform and fix the system to ensure veterans can have timely access and quality care for health care services?>
<TRUMP:> OK. So first of all, I want to ask you one question. You had all those aircraft landings on the carriers, right? So can an otherwise excellent pilot, a very, very good pilot, because I've heard that some just can't do this. What percentage of very, very good pilots cannot land on an aircraft carrier with training?
<QUESTION: Any very good pilot can land on a carrier after they get the training.>
<TRUMP:> After training.
<QUESTION: The training is marvelous.>
<TRUMP:> Because I understand it's a very, very special talent.
<QUESTION: It's a talent that you acquire if you start off with the basics.>
<TRUMP:> OK. Very good. See, he puts it down a little bit. That's very good. <LAUGHTER>
<QUESTION: OK.>
<TRUMP:> That's very good. I've heard it's very, very tough. The Veteran's Administration is a disaster, the V.A., it's a disaster. I have gone to all over the country and I've met so many veterans and I have tremendous veteran support. And I see what those people are going through. To see a doctor, sometimes it takes six and seven days and then you finally get there and the doctor is gone on vacation. We have to change that whole system. It starts with management. We have to have a whole different set of protocols. And we have to get people off the lines. You know, people are dying, not only the 22 suicides a day which is inconceivable when you hear that. When I first heard that I said, no you mean a month. I mean, can you imagine a day, 22 suicides a day? A lot of the suicide is people can't get to see doctors, a lot of it because the waits are so long. That's an administrative problem. And by the way, the V.A. has some great doctors. I've been told by some of the veterans the doctors are great when you can get to see them in many cases. So we have a plan and it's been put out on my website and people love it. If you're going to have a wait of six days, five days, two days, one day, we're going to give our great veterans the right to go out, go across the street to a private doctor or a private hospital or a public hospital, whatever happens to be in that community, without having to drive 400 miles to another hospital. And we're going to give them the right to see their private doctor, get taken care of it, perhaps the private or public hospital. Get taken care of quickly, effectively and go about their business. And the government, we are going to pay the bill. That will totally reduce all of the waiting times, all of the problems. And I think it may actually get the V.A. to respond better to things because, you know, there is a little competition you would think.
<TRUMP:> But it's not like we have a choice. We can't let what's happening happen. I mean, I've heard stories that are so horrible. I mean, people are killing themselves while they're waiting on line because they can't -- you know, they know it's days and days before they can have what could be a simple procedure, what could be a simple prescription. They have to wait so long that they end up -- they can't take it. They can't take it. So we're going to establish a procedure where people can leave the line, go outside, take care of themselves and the government's gonna pay. And by the way, that's a far less expensive solution than other very foolish solutions I've heard. The veterans love it, they love it. But it's a far better solution than anything anybody's heard and its common sense and it's there. And the doctors need the business and the private hospitals and public hospitals need the business and they're sitting there, waiting. So we don't have a choice. We have to do that. OK? Thank you. <APPLAUSE>
<MODERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Trump. We're gonna transition to another set of issues, one that really has become a hallmark of your campaign. And that is, challenging the area of political correctness, Colonel Don Barfamu (ph) was an adjutant general officer and former covenant of the Army A.G. School. He is a decorated combat veteran and he has our next question. Colonel.>
<QUESTION: Sir the U.S. military has been long successful because of the warrior ethos that's part of it's DNA. But under this administration, that ethos has been under attack and in some cases, undermined by the forces of political correctness. The military has become an institutional for social experiments and as a result, the military's undergone a number of changes through regulations with regard to women in combat, transgender rights and other issues. None of these P.C. actions were combat effective or readiness driven. In fact, the opposite is happening. Deploy ability, readiness and moral are all adversely effective -- affected. So my question to you is, what will you do about the social engineering and political correctness that's been imposed upon our military?>
<TRUMP:> Well, we're gonna get away from political correctness and we're gonna have to do that, and... <APPLAUSE> Like the whole concept of profiling, you know, I mentioned the other day profiling, everyone goes, profile and profiling. Well, profiling is you know, in Israel they're doing it and they're doing it well. And we may have to do that, and we may have to do other things. But you're right, we have a politically correct military and it's getting more and more politically correct every day. And a lot of the great people in this room don't even understand how it's possible to do that. And that's through intelligence, not through ignorance, believe me. Because some of the things that they're asking you to do and be politically correct about are ridiculous. I will say I would leave many of the decisions of some of the things you mentioned to the generals, the admirals, the people on top, and we get some of the -- the Congressmen just mentioned to me and I -- I think it's true 100 percent, you get your top enlisted people in that and you have some discussions with some of these top enlisted people who know it better than probably anybody. But we get our military people to come back and make recommendations to me and I will follow those recommendations. I will follow them very strongly. <APPLAUSE>
<MODERATOR: Mr. Trump, the next question will come from Colonel Retired Chaplain Ron Crews. Ron is a highly decorated Army chaplain. He's been deployed several times into combat areas in several different locations. He has personally witnessed the attacks on religious freedoms in the military. After 28 years of service, he now heads the Chaplains' Alliance for Military Religious Liberty. He works closely with the House and the Senate Armed Services Committees to protect these religious liberties. Chaplain Crews?>
<QUESTION: Mr. Trump. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Any relation to Ted Cruz?
<QUESTION: Negative.>
<TRUMP:> And Tom Cruise?
<QUESTION: Negative, sir. (LAUGHTER)>
<TRUMP:> OK now you can take the question. <APPLAUSE>
<QUESTION: Mr. Trump, Army Chaplain who's also a Ranger Joe Lawhorn had a potentially career-ending reprimand for the crime of using Scripture while mentoring a suicide prevention class. Navy Chaplain Wes Modder, who is present today, was detached for cause and threatened with separation for using biblical answers to questions during pastoral counseling sessions with sailors in his command. Air Force Senior Master Sergeant Phil Monk was relieved of duty when his lesbian commander tried and failed to force him to vocally voice his open support for her personal views on marriage. Decorated veteran and retired Air Force Sergeant Oscar Rodriguez was forcefully removed from a friend's retirement ceremony because he intended to use the word ""God"" in that retirement ceremony. Marine Lance Corporal Monifa Sterling was convicted at a court martial for failing to remove Scripture from her personal workspace. Today commanders are prohibited from having Bibles on their desk or using Scriptures while they're counseling troops. The Obama administration has deliberately set out to take the Christian religion out of the military. Mr. Trump, how will you in your administration combat these attacks on military religious freedom of expression?>
<TRUMP:> Well, thank you, that's a great question. And have we ever had a time like this? Have we ever -- has there ever been a thing like what's going on? The other day just to add to your list, I was watching one of the news programs and they had a -- I think high school football coach, you know they're going into battle...
<QUESTION: He's here.>
<TRUMP:> Is he here? Oh stand up. Wow. <APPLAUSE> They really went after him.
<QUESTION: Coach Kennedy.>
<TRUMP:> For saying a prayer before the -- that is just -- I didn't know you'd be here.
<QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)>
<TRUMP:> Wow. The world is changing isn't it? So you're not allowed to pray before a football game. I thought it was horrible. I thought it was horrible. So what did they do to you? What happened? Sorry to take away from your question but it's sort of an extension of your question. What did they do?
<QUESTION: They put me on suspension, then at the end of the year they gave me a really adverse write up about how well I did my job. I didn't change anything for eight years, always prayed after every game. And then he just really slapped me on it, said what a horrible person I was. And ended up just not renewing my contract, ultimately firing me.>
<TRUMP:> I think that is absolutely outrageous. I think it's outrageous. <APPLAUSE> I think it's very, very sad and outrageous. Religious liberty, hey, it's about religious liberty. And there has to be a melding of both. We're living in a time where you have to have a melding of both. But it's very unfair what they're doing to religion in this country. And you know one of the things that I'm doing and I'm -- we have the Johnson Amendment. You know what that is. That Lyndon Johnson in the 1950s passed an amendment because supposedly he was having a hard time with a church in Houston, with a pastor. And he passed an amendment saying basically if you're a pastor, if you're a religious person, you cannot get up and talk politics. You can't really, here's a prime example of it. You know how strongly I feel about it.
<TRUMP:> And I had 50 pastors, ministers, I had priests, I had a couple of rabbis in a big conference room in one of my buildings. And we're talking and I could see they really liked me. But I could also see they couldn't endorse me. And I said, ""Just out of curiosity, why?"" ""Well, we can't do it because we'll lose our tax-exempt status."" I said, ""Why is that? In other words, you're taking away your freedom of speech. And they started telling me about the Johnson Amendment which really was the first time -- and I started studying it and we had a meeting a month later and I said, ""We're gonna get rid of the Johnson Amendment because they're stopping you and our great people from talking."" <APPLAUSE> And Tony and all the people, I mean these are the people we have to hear from and we wanna hear from them. And you don't mind opposing views but they're stopping you from speaking. And actually, your opposing views are able to speak because they don't have to worry about tax exempt status and things. So I think it's very unfair. And one of the things I will do very early in my administration is to get rid of the Johnson Amendment so that our great pastors and ministers and rabbis and -- and everybody -- and priests and everybody can go and tell and can participate in the process. I actually looked at 50 people in the room, they're strong people, powerful people by personality and I said they're really holding your voice back. So you have these powerful people, some were incredible speakers, just a natural gift for speaking. And I pointed down, way down on the street on 5th avenue, I said so those people walking along the street have more power than you do? And I think that's very unfair. You should be able to speak. And I think that we'll go a long way to addressing the problem that you had but you have lost a lot of the -- the -- its amazing, the church and religion has lost tremendous power and positive power. This isn't negative power, this is positive power by the fact that they are essentially prohibited from speaking because of the tremendous problem they have. So one of the things I'm gonna do and I have tremendous support with the evangelicals and with the Christians and with everybody, is we're going to get rid of the Johnson Amendment that is very, very unfair, OK? <APPLAUSE>
<MODERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Trump. And in fact, in relation to that, last week the Republican leadership introduced a measure that would in fact repeal the portion of the Johnson Amendment that prohibits speech by churches and non-profits. And that was in a large part because of the visibility you're given to that issue, in fact insisting that it be in the GOP platform, the repeal of that, as well. So we thank you for speaking out... (CROSSTALK)>
<TRUMP:> I'm very honored by that, yeah they did it last week so that's the beginning of my process.
<MODERATOR: Let me speak to another issue...>
<TRUMP:> That's on the assumption I win. If I don't win you just wasted because that's never happening, folks. <LAUGHTER> You've wasted a lot of time and energy and money.
<MODERATOR: Well, yesterday -- speaking of the Johnson Amendment -- yesterday was the Pulpit Freedom Sunday and there were thousands of pastors across the nation, myself included, that preached messages about this election and the importance of this election. And the IRS can be on standby, my sermon is on the way to the IRS now so that they can evaluate it. And -- and we'll see what happens at that point but it's time that churches and Christians have the freedom to speak in this country about what is affecting this country. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Why is your sermon on the way, did they ask you for it?
<MODERATOR: No I want -- I want them to hear it. I speak good for them to hear the Gospel first off and then my political statement secondly.>
<TRUMP:> OK good, but that is a terrible situation, isn't it? Where they can say we don't like the way you're speaking about Christianity, about God. We don't like what you just said and we're gonna take away your tax exempt status which you know how important it is. It's very, very -- it's a very sad thing.
<MODERATOR: You had mentioned that generals and the admirals and I wanna talk -- don't forget the sergeants, all right?>
<TRUMP:> No that's what I'm talking about. We wanna get their advice also, believe me.
<MODERATOR: In fact, Coach Kennedy -- his story which was actually broken by Todd Starnes at Fox News -- is a retired Marine gunnery sergeant and... (APPLAUSE) And our -- our final question -- I do wanna thank you again for being so generous with your time and having this conversation with these military warriors. I want to go back to something you spoke about earlier in relationship to the V.A. but also about the well- being of our warriors. You know a nation is judged by how it takes care of its warriors. Those who have defended our ideals and our principles and have been willing to put themselves in harm's way. And this is not unconnected with the conversation we were just having. Because it is that Christian ethic that even Jesus talked about, ""Greater love hath no man than to lay down his life for his friends."" And many in this room have been willing to do so. But they have seen their friends make the ultimate sacrifice. And that is -- that is a burden that they carry. And it is a difficulty that they face. And we should not require them to face that alone as a nation. And so our final question comes from Staff Sergeant Chad Robichaux. Sergeant Robichaux is a former Special Operations Force Recon Marine. That is the toughest of the tough in the USMC. He was deployed eight times to combat. He suffered and has fully recovered from depression and PTSD. He has been there, done that. He now heads the Mighty Oaks Warrior Program that serves active duty veterans and their families in the most statistically successful such program of its kind in the country. Staff Sergeant Robichaux. (APPLAUSE)>
<QUESTION: Good morning Mr. Trump. As you mentioned there is a tragic suicide epidemic among our veterans, among our military and their families. While the military and the V.A. are working on the problem, their efforts continue to fall short. There are a number of faith-based programs outside the DOD and the V.A., that are continuing to be successful in stopping suicide and divorce rates. Spiritual fitness works on these types of problems. The government is not taking advantage of these programs and services. So my question for you is, when you become president, will you support and fund a more holistic approach to solve the problems and issues of veteran suicide, PTSD, TBI and other related military mental and behavioral health issues and will you take steps to restore the historic role of our Chaplains and the importance of spiritual fitness and spiritual resiliency programs?>
<TRUMP:> Yes I would. Look we need that so badly and when you... <APPLAUSE> When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over and you're strong and you can handle it. But a lot of people can't handle it. And they see horror stories. They see events that you couldn't see in a movie, nobody would believe it. Now we need a mental health help and medical. And it's one of the things that I think is least addressed and is one of the things that -- like your question -- one of the things that I hear the most about when I go around and talk to the veterans. So we're going to have a very, very robust, level of performance having to do with mental health. We are losing so many great people that can be taken care of if they have proper care. You know when you hear the 22 suicides a day it's a big part of your question. But when you hear the 22 suicides a day that should never be. That should never be. So we're going to be addressing that very strongly and the whole mental health issue is going to be a very important issue when I take over and the V.A. is going to be fixed in so many ways but that's going to be one of the ways we're going to help. And that's in many respects going to be the number one thing we have to do. Because I think it's really been left behind. OK? Thank you very much.
<QUESTION: Can I just say one thing? Tony, we were talking last night, and one of the things that we are excited about is that you're beholden to nobody.>
<TRUMP:> That's true.
<QUESTION: Except maybe Kellyanne (ph).>
<TRUMP:> Kellyanne <ph>. <LAUGHTER>
<QUESTION: Yeah. But you're gonna have to choose leaders. You're beholden to no one. We'd like to see a secretary of defense that is there because he or she has the capabilities and the qualities that are required to move our military back to where it needs to be. You're beholden to no one, we could give you several recommendations if you're interested, but -- but. (LAUGHTER)>
<TRUMP:> I do want that. I actually like that, I think -- I mean who else should I be listening to but the people in this room?
<QUESTION: Military leaders. (APPLAUSE) Obviously, we believe that some of your key employments will be the military leadership, civilian and in uniform.>
<TRUMP:> I agree 100 percent, General.
<MODERATOR: Again, Mr. Trump thank you for the generosity of your time. But I wanna close our time together asking you to speak directly to these warriors who, as you look in their faces, you can see some of the scars that came with their service to our country. You can see the years that they have devoted to the principles and ideals that made America great. But they're here reporting for duty again. They realize that a lot is on the line for our country. And so as you sit here before them this morning before you depart, what would be your final words to them as they go back to their respective parts of the country? >
<TRUMP:> Well, Tony, thank you very much and I will say this. Just as the General said I'm beholding to nobody, I've spent you know, tens and tens of millions of dollars on the campaign. I am going to spending a lot more over the next month. In addition, we've raised a lot of money from small people that -- people that give small donations, people that wanna be a part of it and they've been very much left behind. We call them the forgotten man and woman. And we've raised millions of -- more than any Republican ever thought possible and you know, you've heard $28 million one month and $41 million and that these are in small, $61 average donations approximately. And we've very proud of that but the truth is I am beholden to no one, nobody's gonna tell me what to do, no -- no group that owns a military firm that gives military supplies. Because I know -- I've heard the case where often times you wanna buy certain weapons or something and you like one but you get the other one because that one has a contact to our politicians. Those days are over, those days are over. You're gonna get the best -- you're gonna get the best equipment. <APPLAUSE> You're gonna get what's good, you're gonna get what the generals and what the admirals and what -- and the enlisted and they'll -- we'll get together, we wanna get the right stuff. But the truth is, that the people in this room and your representatives all over this country, the military people are so important to our country. Without you, we wouldn't be here. I don't think you've been given the respect that you deserve. I don't think you've been allowed to fight ISIS as an example the way you wanted. I don't think you've been allowed to fight for Iraq the way you've wanted. If they listen to the military people, we probably wouldn't be having an ISIS right now. I think I can say not probably, I think we definitely wouldn't be having an ISIS right now. But we're running a war by politicians and we're running a war by political correctness as per that question. I can only tell you this and I used to speak about it all the time, we have a Navy that hasn't been in this position since World War I.
<TRUMP:> We have an Army that hasn't been in this position since World War II, in terms of levels and in terms of readiness and in terms of everything else. We are not capable like we have to be. This will be one of my most important elements. When I talk cost cutting, I do for so many different departments where the money is pouring and they don't even know what to do with it. But when it comes to the military we have to enhance our military. It's depleted. That's the word I tend to use. It's a depleted -- we have a very depleted military. We have great people, we have a depleted military. I told you about the jet fighters. Well it's like that with so many other things. So we are going to take care of our military. We're going to take care of our military -- the people in our military, the finest people we have. We are going to take care of our law enforcement because in some ways that's going hand in hand now more and more when you see what's going on. And the people that we're allowing into our country, we are allowing people into our country that are going to cause us tremendous problems. This isn't a question of will it happen; this a question of when. Where people coming into our country who are going to cause you and our law enforcement tremendous problems and therefore our society in the future. Because we have politicians that should be ashamed of themselves. So I can only say this, a very, very important element of any country, but our country, and in my opinion, the single most important thing that a president can do is the defense of our country. I mean we can talk all of the elements. We can talk about Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. We can talk about school, we can talk about everything. Defense is number one or we don't have a country. <APPLAUSE> Our military and the strength of our military and the strengthening of our military is a number one priority for the Trump administration. And the world's going to respect us again and they don't now. A lot of that has to do with the leader. And a lot of it has to do with leadership. But our country is going to be respected again and we are going to make America great again. Thank you all very much. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-05"">
<TRUMP:> This is something. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Wow. <APPLAUSE> This is great. Wow. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you very much. I hope everybody way up on the hill -- can you hear me up there? Can you hear me? <APPLAUSE> Wow. Amazing. And we have crowds like this all over our great country. It's a movement like nobody's ever seen before. And on November 8th, we must get out to complete the movement and then the work begins. OK? And then the work begins. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody, very much. It's great to be here in the city of Henderson. I know Henderson very well, a lot of friends. <APPLAUSE> You know, a fabulous, fabulous state that we all love -- this is a special state. I've certainly spent a lot of money in this state if it's not. And we have right down the road a very successful hotel, Trump International, and it's been great. <APPLAUSE> Really great. So I want to thank everybody. In 34 days, we're going to win this state, and we're going to win back the White House. <APPLAUSE> So, how many of you watched the vice presidential debate last night? <APPLAUSE> Mike Pence did an incredible job. And I'm getting a lot of credit, because that's really my first so-called choice. That was my first hire, as we would say in Las Vegas. <APPLAUSE> And I'll tell you, he's a good one. He was phenomenal. He was cool. He was smart. He was -- I mean, you just take a look at him. He was meant to be doing what he's doing, and we are very, very proud of Governor Mike Pence. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, Mike Pence. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of vice presidential debates. I believe that. <APPLAUSE> And last night, America also got to look first-hand at my judgment, and that was judgment. You know, you need judgment for people, for deals. We don't do deals like the Iran deal. We don't do deals like that anymore, folks. We don't do deals like that -- $1.7 billion in cash, and we're in Las Vegas. When you hear $1.7 billion, I think this whole state would be filled up to the roof.
<TRUMP:> Whoever heard of things like what's going on? Unbelievable. Well, Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America. His opponent talked only of small and petty distractions. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything. <AUDIENCE BOOING> She goes around -- we'll do this, we'll do that, we'll do this -- all these things. It's all wonderful. The problem is why didn't she do them? In fact, she's just made things worse. She failed in upstate New York as a senator, promising to create -- in order to get elected -- 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down more than 40 percent and the jobs have left. It's just the opposite. She failed overseas, producing only death and destruction. She unleashed ISIS, destabilized Iraq, Syria, Libya and put Iran on to the path of nuclear weapons. In less than 10 years now, they will have nuclear weapons. One of the dumbest deals ever made, whether it's countries or any kind of a deal you can think of, one of the dumbest deals ever made. At home, Hillary Clinton failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities, and you see that. You see that all -- wherever you go to the inner cities, nothing happens, it never happens, it's called give me your vote and then they don't come back. Four years later, they come back. She's merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding our country dry. They are bleeding our country. I'm running to represent Americans, and we are going to make America rich again. We're not rich. We're a debtor nation right now. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to end illegal immigration. <APPLAUSE> Stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our totally disastrous trade deals and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our businesses. <APPLAUSE> My economic agenda will be very, very simple. It's called jobs, jobs, jobs. <APPLAUSE> Our jobs are all leaving. The problems we face as a country are immense, and it's going to take bold action to turn things around. We need change. We need change. Right now, we owe $20 trillion debt, $20 trillion dollars. It doubled under President Obama. <AUDIENCE BOOING> Our infrastructure is like that of a Third World country. The homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single year increase in more than 45 years. Does anybody know that? Biggest increase in homicide in 45 years. Our police are underfunded, understaffed and under-supported, and Hillary Clinton basically accuses our police of all being racists. <AUDIENCE BOOING> Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into our country on an hourly basis.<AUDIENCE BOOING>
<TRUMP:> Thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare, even as our own veterans, our great, great veterans, die while they're waiting online for medical care that they desperately need. <AUDIENCE BOOING> Our veterans will be taken care of like they've never been taken care of before. <APPLAUSE> Do we have some veterans in the group? Stand up. Stand up, veterans. <APPLAUSE> Wow. <APPLAUSE> We have such tremendous support from the veterans group, from law enforcement, veterans groups from all over the country. We just had the endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents massive amounts of police. Almost every police group, almost every veteran group. And then I saw today -- I left the room and I saw a commercial where it was really a nasty commercial. Totally made up about me with vets. There's nobody that loves the vets more or respects the vets more. They're spending hundreds of millions of dollars on false commercials, and it's a disgrace. So what we'll do, I guess we'll sue them. Let's sue them, right? Let's sue them. It's unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> They say, let's see where's Trump doing well? He's doing well with the vets, oh let's do a commercial on the vets. And whatever's unpopular, they'll just put it in. Let me tell you. We're going to take care of our vets like you've never been taken care of before. Remember that. <APPLAUSE> Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly, listen to this, $800 billion a year. You say, who's negotiating our deals, right? We have political hacks negotiating our deals. And we have the greatest business people in the world in our country. Why aren't we using them? $800 billion a year in trade. The federal budget is a total disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of crooked Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion. Can you imagine this? They lost it. You know, you lose a couple of bucks. They lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds. <AUDIENCE BOOING> We have the worst so-called recovery by far since the Great Depression. We're a nation totally divided with race riots in the streets. Our college students graduate loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs or certainly not the jobs they want or not the jobs they were trained for and worked so hard to get. Those jobs have left. Our allies aren't paying their fair share. Foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us. Do you ever see Hillary Clinton when she wants to talk tough about Putin? They say, Donald Trump loves Putin. <LAUGHTER> I don't love. I don't hate. We'll see how it works. We'll see. Maybe we'll have a good relationship. Maybe we'll have a horrible relationship. Maybe we'll have a relationship right in the middle. I can say this. If we got along with Russia and Russia went out with us and knocked the hell out of ISIS, that's OK with me, folks. That's OK with me.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> So our taxpayers and us, all of us as citizens, are sending troops and foreign aid all over the world, even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services. We go to some of these Middle Eastern locations and we'll build a school and they blow it up, and we build it again, and they blow it up. But when we want a school here or in Brooklyn, New York, or in Los Angeles or someplace else, we don't have the funds. We've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, think of that. We could have rebuilt our country twice if we knew what the hell we were doing, and we're not respected at all. <APPLAUSE> America needs a turnaround, America needs a comeback, America needs a change, and that's why I'm running. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. On November 8th, we're going to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever, ever, ever before; stronger than ever before. <APPLAUSE> First, we're going to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> President Obama said if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. That was a lie. He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 per person. That was a lie; instead they surged to much more than $5,000. And you know it because you're all here, you're all witnesses. Now, it happens. Yesterday, right? Bill Clinton yesterday, they're so angry at him. They scolded him yesterday, he was scolded. Did everybody hear what happened yesterday?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> And this is what I've been saying for years. So Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. <APPLAUSE> Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party and of our country itself, right? But Bill had a different view, he said it's just a crazy system. <LAUGHTER> And that's the way he said it, ""it's the craziest thing in the whole world."" Then he went on to say ""well, people out there are busting it,"" true, they're working like hell, they're busting it. Sometimes 60 hours a week and wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half, this is Bill Clinton, ""the people are getting killed"" he said, ""in this deal and small business people and individuals who make just a bit too much money to get these subsidies, you know what happens, they don't get anything; they get nothing."" Clinton added, ""It doesn't make any sense; the insurance model just doesn't work.""<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> So, you know, they're always telling me, oh, if you say something, just apologize. Just apologize. I think that President Obama should apologize for Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> And I think that Hillary Clinton should apologize for pursuing Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse than it is right now. We're going to repeal it and we're going to replace it with much less expensive and much better care. <APPLAUSE> Now this is essential for your great state and my great state. Because Obamacare, the majority of the counties in your state have only one insurer to choose from. Did you read that this morning in your good paper? Good paper. Owned by a great guy. Sheldon! Sheldon, Sheldon Adelson. And a great supporter of Israel, Sheldon Adelson. <APPLAUSE> Great supporter. There's only one way to stop Obamacare: vote for Donald J. Trump. Very simple. Very simple. <APPLAUSE> Very simple. <APPLAUSE> It's a very simple way to do it. You got to get out there November 8th. I say kiddingly, but I mean it. I don't care how sick you are. <LAUGHTER> I don't care if you just came back from the doctor and he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it's over. You won't be around in two weeks. Doesn't matter. Hang out until November 8th. Get out and vote. And then all we're going to say is we love you and we will remember you always. Get out and vote. <APPLAUSE> And don't let the other sides take this election away from us because this is the last chance we get. And I see Elvis back there. Elvis. This is the last chance we get. The deadline to register to vote is October 8th in your state. So you can do that early, this way you do not have to wait around until November 8th if you are the person seeing the doctor, right? No, we have all great, healthy people. You have to be healthy because Obamacare doesn't work so you have to have -- you really have no choice. That's the only thing good about Obamacare is you have to maintain your health, which is good psychologically to think that way, because Obamacare will not be there. It is a disaster. Early voting begins on the 22nd, fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival. China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money. The devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents to our country, our businesses, our citizens, and our jobs. Every time we start making progress, China devalues its currency and we go right back to the drawing board. Because you can't compete against that. It's cheating. We are not going to level playing field and our politicians do not understand what is going on. They really do not get it. And the ones that do get it are taken care of with political contributions so they close their eyes.
<TRUMP:> We're going to do something much different. And I am spending my own money on my campaign. I'll tell you. I'm spending a fortune. <APPLAUSE> One of the very big pundits, very respected, actually very liberal, said you know what you've done has never been done before. And it makes no difference if you win or lose this movement will go down in history. I said, no, you don't understand. I like to agree with you. But if I don't win, this will be the greatest waste of time, money and energy in my lifetime by a factor of 100. Because if we don't win, we can't change things. We can't bring back common sense. We can't strengthen our military which is so depleted. We can't save our 2nd Amendment, so many different things. So we have to win. We have to win. Our jobs are being lost -- <APPLAUSE> -- in massive numbers and we're not making things relatively speaking in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries. When I'm President, we will start making things in America again. <APPLAUSE> Our nation has lost one-third of it's manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA. You know it was Clinton that signed it, a lot of people don't know that. One of the worst trade deals in the history of the world. The deal was also supported very strongly by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal, South Korea, cost us another 100,000 jobs. Remember that? It was supposed to be a good deal. It cost us jobs, tremendous numbers of jobs. And South Korea, like almost every other country, is laughing at how stupid we are. Since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed deal 70,000 factories, when I saw 70,000, I said, please go back it can't be possible. Can't be possible. I figured maybe 700, 7,000. 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. Can you believe this? 70,000. That's 15 factories closing a day on average. We are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world. Our jobs are being stolen by countries with much smarter leadership than ours. Not going to happen anymore folks. Not going to happen anymore. <APPLAUSE> As the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close. Schools suffer. The tax base erodes. Wages fall and the quality of life totally declines. Real cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in 1973. I usually say 18 years, but it goes back much further. People think of this, people are working harder today. They have sometimes two or three jobs, than they were, I'll just say with <inaudible> this is 1973. Eighteen years. So they made more money 18 years ago, let me tell you. They're younger. They are less experienced. Today, they work harder. They're older and they make less money. Now the only thing that I can say to make you feel better, is I'm also older and I'm also working the hardest I've ever worked in my life doing this. This is the hardest I've ever worked in my life.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> It's true. That's true. This is work. Although it's like love, but it's work. But we're getting there, we're gonna make America great again, it's gonna be worth it, OK? <APPLAUSE> We rebuild other countries at the expense of our own. Skyscrapers going up in Beijing while plants and factories crumble in the United States. Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat-Chrysler and so many others -- I could go by the hundreds -- are moving their jobs to Mexico and other countries. And now Ford has announced, two weeks ago, it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico on top of the massive plant that they announced three years ago that's going to cost $2 billion that's now complete. And then you wonder why we're doing well in Michigan? And Ohio? Because I've been saying this for five years. I haven't been saying this for the last two weeks, like Hillary, who doesn't know what's happening. I've been saying this for five years and the people of Michigan know that and the people of Ohio know that. And that's why we're way up in Ohio and that's why we're doing so well in Michigan, a state that normally a Republican wouldn't do that well in. But they're losing all their jobs to Mexico and other places. We're going to -- well, you ready for this one folks? We're going to renegotiate NAFTA -- <APPLAUSE> -- and if we don't get the deal we want we will withdraw from NAFTA and start all over again making better deals for our workers. It's going to be America first. It's America first. No more like, let's take care of everybody else except ourselves. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> We're also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation and apply tariffs and taxes to the countries that cheat. That way we neutralize, that way our businesses can compete and we won't lose our jobs. <APPLAUSE> We will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal she called the gold standard, Hillary Clinton said. And then during the debate she lied, and she said, ""I never said that."" And then they actually fact-checked her and they said, ""Trump was right."" Finally I'm right. Finally. <APPLAUSE> Every time I made a statement this character challenged me. She can say whatever she wants. Say are you going to check that statement? So they check the statement. She called it the gold standard. Let me tell you, TPP will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing's like NAFTA, but it'll take your jobs our of your state, it'll take them out of Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania -- TPP is a disaster. And they don't cover currency manipulation. Because our politicians didn't want to put the necessary language into the documents, and the documents are over 5,000 pages long, and nobody from our country practically has even read that. Don't let it happen. And if I win, forget it.
<TRUMP:> And we're gonna have trade. But instead of having trade deals with all of these different countries, that's so complicated, we'll do trade one on one. One, one, one, one, one, and if they don't treat us right, we send them a letter of default. And by the time letter of default and ""now you can't do that,"" because you've got to go through ""this looks like a jigsaw puzzle."" The backers of the TPP have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton and their wish is her command. She's an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors. I'm an outsider fighting for you, that's what I'm doing this fall. <APPLAUSE> We will stop the foreign cheating, the product dumping and the one sided trade deals. This stuff will not happen anymore folks; we're not going to have a country left. We'll lower taxes on American businesses from 35 percent to 15 percent and many small businesses will file as individuals and pay only 12 percent, a massive tax cut. <APPLAUSE> On top of that, we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history, our regulations are a disaster; they're putting businesses out of business. Our tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4 percent growth and create at least 25 million new jobs within a decade. America will become the great jobs magnet of the world. <APPLAUSE> And I will the greatest jobs President that God ever created, I'll tell you that that will happen. <APPLAUSE> That will happen. Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorer citizens will get new jobs and higher pay and new hope for their life. <APPLAUSE> But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation. Security begins at the border, you understand. <APPLAUSE> Any government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead. <APPLAUSE> Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. <APPLAUSE> This includes incredible Americans like 21 years Sarah Root, unbelievable person. The man who killed arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released immediately into the U.S. community under the immigration policies of Obama -- Clinton <ph>. He was released again and again after crime, and now he's at large. Sarah graduated from college with a 4.0 grade point index, number one in her class the day before she was viciously killed.
<TRUMP:> Also among the victims of the Obama -- Clinton open border policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year old convenience store clerk from Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody. Then there's the case of 90 year old Earl Olander <ph> who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, but who did not meet the Obama administration's priority for removal. In California a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Farris <ph>, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but for whatever reason was never deported. Also in California, my good friend, great guy, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at age 17. He was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant for no reason whatsoever. The killer had three gun charges as well as battery of police officers prior to the shooting, but he had not been deported. They just did not want to do it. I'd like to invite up to the stage now some of the families from the incredible Remembrance Project who are here today and these are amazing, amazing people. <APPLAUSE> They've lost their loved ones for no reason. <APPLAUSE> <CROSSTALK>
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!>
<TRUMP:> Mike! Come out here, Mike. Come out here, Mike. How about - do you want to say something on behalf of your boy?
<GIBBONEY: Yes, thank you. Hi. My name is Agnes Gibboney. (APPLAUSE) My family immigrated to the United States legally. It took us 13 years. (APPLAUSE) My only son, (inaudible) that I carry on my shirt and my daughter's shirt was murdered by an illegal alien who had been previously deported. In ten days, it will be my birthday. None of my family is here anymore. I would like to ask each and every one of you to recruit one or two people, maybe more, to vote for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump listens to us. We have had many meetings with him privately and he listens and he cares. He is an honorable, honorable man. (APPLAUSE) Our system, our immigration system is not broken. We have laws, we just need to enforce them. And Mr. Trump, let's build that wall. (APPLAUSE)>
<WILKERSON: Thank you. My name is Laura Wilkerson and my son, Joshua, was 18 and a senior in high school. He was brutally tortured, murdered, and set on fire.>
<WILKERSON: Mr. Trump has seen us cry. He has seen us smile. He has seen us persevere and he cares about American families. He's cared about the Remembrance Project. He cares about our national program to help other families when this happens to them. Mr. Trump seems the only one that gets the simplicity of this: if you thrive as mothers and fathers, if your children thrive, if we're healthy, if we're wealthy, America thrives. It's so simple. He wants you to thrive. He wants my kid back so he could thrive. He wants education, he wants it all for American's families so that America will be the greatest country there is. Thank you, Mr. Trump. (APPLAUSE)>
<UNKNOWN: It is such an honor to be here with all of you. And it is such an honor to be here in support of Mr. Trump. My husband was a police officer who went to duty, he went to work, and he was shot by an illegal alien. But while he was doing what he was doing best, he saved an elderly man who was in the direct line of fire. He put himself in between this man and the shooter and when it was all said and done, my husband was shot through the neck, vocal cord was severed, he went into (ph) the ground as a quadriplegic. The doctor told us he would never walk or talk again, but he was a man of great resolve, a man of courage. He was able to regain that voice, get back those hands. From a wheelchair he went to his department and said I do not want this retirement. I want to continue to be a police officer. (APPLAUSE) He actually protected the citizens in Southern California from a helicopter. He did not need his legs. And he caught a lot of bad guys. I know greatness. My husband was the recipient of the Medal of Valor Congressional Awards. He was the recipient of the Man of Courage, which was created in his name. And I recognize another man that fits those descriptions. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Thank you.
<UNKNOWN: Please, please, please, I ask all of you. There is nothing more precious to us than our loved ones, mothers and fathers, wives and husbands. This vote is so important because it means the safety of our loved, it means securing our borders, it means enforcing the laws that are already on the books. This man is the only one that is going to accomplish those goals. So get out the votes and vote for Mr. Trump! God bless you. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> <OFF-MIKE> <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Amazing. And in story after story and it's -- this is just a small group of the people, but I tell them every time I'm with them. I say, your loved ones will not have died in vain. You know what I mean. <APPLAUSE> Incredible people, the Remembrance. I will tell you, it's incredible people. It's a tough thing to go through. There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with criminal convictions in the country right now and more who have committed crimes, you would not believe it. But who have escaped the law entirely. When I am president, we are getting them out of our country and were getting them out immediately, quickly fast.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And a lot of the countries from where they came won't take them back. They don't want them back. They're killers, they're this, they're that. We don't want them back. And under Hillary Clinton's State Department she said -- Oh, they won't take them back, huh? Under a Trump administration I promise you, every single one of them will be taken back gladly. Gladly. OK? Gladly. They don't want to take them back, so they're on our streets, killing people. All Americans living lovely <ph> in this country, including millions of wonderful, patriotic, hard-working immigrants are entitled to have their jobs and wages and their security totally protected. The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today -- everybody. And those borders are erased -- it's often done by the lawful immigrants already here. And if you look at what's going on with the borders, and very simply, if they are erased, and if we have no borders, we really have no country. And that's really what's happened. And I have to tell you I've been endorsed by the border patrol agents, 16,500. By ICE, two days ago -- ICE. First time they've ever endorsed anybody for president. I was endorsed by Sheriff Joe. Sheriff Joe knows the border. He knows the border. We love Sheriff Joe. At the same time our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just two days ago an immigrant from Bangladesh in yet another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11. The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey last week, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota two weeks ago, were foreign nationals admitted into our country as was the mall shooter in Washington State. No more folks. No more. Now the media doesn't want to talk about this. They really don't. Just like they don't want to show the crowd. Just like they don't want to show the crowd. <AUDIENCE BOOING> The never want to show the crowd. <AUDIENCE BOOING> Never ever. <AUDIENCE BOOING> Did you ever go home and you watch and you hear this roar, it sounds like you're at Ohio State football game -- so you know there's thousands and thousands. We were yesterday in Arizona. We had a line that was a mile and a half long trying to get in. It's incredible. We were in Colorado the day before. We had a line -- you wouldn't believe. The stadiums we fill up. The arenas that we fill up. And they never take the camera off my face. Never. People say how was the crowd? I say didn't you see? Oh I loved your speech. But didn't you see the crowd? No I heard but they never, ever show the crowd. And that's for good reason. They don't want to show the crowds. Because nobody's ever had crowds like this, and it's not me, it's you. This is a movement like never before, remember that. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And believe me the media which is totally dishonest is a big, big part of the problem that our country is having. <APPLAUSE> These are really dishonest people. You watch the Clinton news network, CNN. It's a joke. It's actually a joke. <AUDIENCE BOOING> It's a joke. And I think most people are starting to understand it. The good news, their ratings are bing. The Boston bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino shooter was here through a fiance visa. Sounds so nice, doesn't it? A fiance visa. Oh, coming in to get married, from Saudi Arabia, right? Came in, probably radicalized him, went out, killed 14 people, that shortly before gave them a party honoring their new child. Shot them. Killed them. Many wounded. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan. I'm going to keep the terrorists out of our country. <APPLAUSE> Not going to have them. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees. <AUDIENCE BOOING> She's for open borders. Remember this, I'm not running to be president of the world. I'm running to be president of the United States and we're all going to protect each other. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to make, I say it again, and I'll say it again and again, we are going to make America first again. Remember that. America first. We're going to make America first. <APPLAUSE> We're going to build the wall. And we're going to enforce our laws. And we're going to keep our people safe. I have a simple message for the cartels, the gang members, the drug dealers, preying on our citizens, destroying our youth. Your days are numbered. Your reign of crime will very soon come crashing to a very ugly end. You're getting the hell out of this country. <APPLAUSE> We're also going to end government corruption. Hillary Clinton put her e-mails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hackers. <AUDIENCE BOOING> Then she bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after getting a congressional subpoena. You can't even do that in a private case. She lied to Congress under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals. <AUDIENCE BOOING> Now we've learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides that it was OK for them to destroy their laptops. Do you believe this?<AUDIENCE BOOING>
<TRUMP:> Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots. Go out there get them done. November 8th, get in. We're also -- we're going to end this, folks. We're going to end it. We can't let this happen. We're like a third world country. We can't let this go on. I've never seen anything like it in my life and neither have you. We're also going to fix our inner cities. And help our Latino- American citizens and our African-American citizens. we are going to help. It's time. <APPLAUSE> Forty-five percent of African-American youth live in poverty. 58 percent of African-American youth don't have jobs. More than 3,000 people have been shot in the city of Chicago, Obama's hometown, since the beginning of the year. That's since January. Not a long time. Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C., and more than 60 percent in Baltimore. The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50, 60, 70 even 100 years unbroken. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools and rising crime. To those African-Americans suffering in our country, I say, what the hell do you have to lose? I will fix it. Vote for me. I'm going to fix it. What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? <APPLAUSE> Nothing to lose. They come in for your vote. They get your vote. Then they do nothing. I'm also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty and to help their children grow up in safety and in peace. Which they're not doing now. <APPLAUSE> Poor communities will see a massive infusion of new small business come pouring in, with new high-paying beautiful jobs. <APPLAUSE> I'm also going to fight to provide school choice to every low income, African-American and Latino child in this country. <APPLAUSE> I want to put every American child on the ladder to success. That means a great education and a high-paying job that you love. Here is some of the more amazing things we're going to do for our country starting in 2017. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe even bigger than that, looks like. <APPLAUSE> We're going to eliminate every unnecessary regulation which is choking our businesses and killing our jobs. She wants to raise your taxes and she wants far more regulation. We're going to end education, we're going to end common core. <APPLAUSE> We're bringing our education local. We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> Bill Clinton's said we have to do it. So we'll have to listen to him. Oh, he's suffering now. And all he did is tell the truth. We're going to make childcare affordable. We're going to save our 2nd Amendment, which is under siege.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We are going to support the men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We're going to rebuild our very depleted military and we are going to take care of our great veterans. <APPLAUSE> We are going to appoint Justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> This election day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman, and child in this country. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. <APPLAUSE> The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by, and for the people. <APPLAUSE> I am going to fight for every last citizen in this land, and I'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we stated working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. Can you imagine? <APPLAUSE> Can you imagine? You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, you're going to remember this day. This is a movement like nobody has ever seen before. Even Bill O'Reilly said it's the single greatest political phenomena of his lifetime, that's good. <APPLAUSE> That's good. And many others -- and many that dislike me say the same thing. We're going to make history together, you're going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote that you've ever cast for anyone at anytime. <APPLAUSE> A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you; you're voting for you, believe me. <APPLAUSE> It's the way I look at it. <APPLAUSE> You're voting to believe in yourselves, you're voting to believe in your country. All together, we are going to make America wealthy again. We're going to make America strong again. We're going to make America safe again. We're going to make America great again. I love you, thank you, God bless you. God bless you, go out and vote November 8th, thank you. Thank you. God bless you, everyone.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-06"">
<TRUMP:> Is that mic working? It's like the presidential debate, the commission where they gave us a bum mic. Some commission that is. So, I want to thank everybody. This is great. You know, New Hampshire -- we won New Hampshire in the primaries big league. Far exceeding the numbers that everybody thought and now I hear we're winning by one and tied and winning by two and tied in another one. How are you? So, I just want to thank everybody. This is great to be with you. So these just came out. Remember whenever we won I like to talk about polls. If we're doing badly, I don't talk about polls. No, it's true. When we do badly, I don't know about polls, right. But when we're doing well I know about polls. I used to drive -- Chris Christie is here, our friend. Where is Chris? Right over here. <APPLAUSE> And he was a tough competitor and he said, you used to drive me crazy when you talk about the polls. Why did you talk about the polls? I said because I was number one. But if I was number two or something, we wouldn't be talking. But, first of all, thank you everyone. And New Hampshire was where we had our first victory. You remember that, right. <APPLAUSE> And then we went on to lots of other places -- lots of other places. And we had tremendous support from so many of our friends and tremendous complements. Tom Brady and Coach Belichick and so many people we just have great relationships with and great relationships up here. So, these just came out, just literally came out. Rasmussen, that's national polls, Trump 43, Clinton, 41. <APPLAUSE> Los Angeles Times, national, great polls supposedly. Well, that's because I'm leading. <LAUGHTER> Trump, 46 national, Clinton, 42. <APPLAUSE> UPI national, Trump 49, Clinton 47. Reuters Ipsos, South Carolina, Trump 49, Clinton 44. South Carolina is great. That is where we had another great -- had another great attendance. The results in South Carolina during the primary were amazing and it was fantastic. Great people. Colorado, Trump 45, Clinton 43. I just left, that was a good one. <APPLAUSE> And Wisconsin, where I'm going tomorrow -- Wisconsin they have Trump at 42 and Clinton at 42, and that's OK because I was about 15 points behind three or four weeks ago, I think, right? <APPLAUSE> So, what'd I tell you? So, that's one. All right, anybody can check them. You can check them. Now here's one that's a biggie, UPI just came out like a little while ago. Virginia, I love the Virginia. Tremendous properties in Virginia, a lot of employees. I think all my employees are voting, I tell you. Virginia, Trump 50, Clinton 45. <APPLAUSE> UPI -- UPI, that's a big one -- that's big one. It's a little surprise. Look at the media, they're going crazy. They don't know what's happened. They don't know, they can't believe this. They are not happy, I want to tell you. This is not the way it's supposed to be happening. <APPLAUSE> The American people, right. This is not -- this is not what they had in mind. The crooked, media with the crooked Hillary. New Hampshire, 48-48. What's wrong? What's going on here? New Hampshire, 48-48. I don't like that. That does not sound like my friends from. We're going to win New Hampshire. We're going to win New Hampshire. <APPLAUSE> These all just came out a little while ago. Arizona, 52, Clinton, 42. Wow, up by 10. Here's a good one, North Carolina, UPI -- North Carolina, Trump 50, Clinton, 46. Whoa! Look at this one. The state of Pennsylvania where I went to school, went to college, Pennsylvania, Trump 50, Clinton, 46. <APPLAUSE> And here's another good one, great state, I love the people of Georgia. Trump, 52, Clinton, 43. Wow you send it back to the press so they can examine it. <APPLAUSE> So, I just want to thank you very much, it's really amazing, and I want to thank Chris for being here, and all of my friends. So many -- Steve I see over here and all of the friends that I have, it's been incredible. And you know, I wanted to be here because we have lots of energy and we love the people. And we love the people, in particular because it was my first day it meant so much for me. And I use to come up -- thank you, I feel the same way. But I used to come up and we used to have meetings with people and they kept talking about heroin, heroin, heroin. I tell the story all over New Hampshire because it's so different than these beautiful little valleys and the trees and the lakes and the beautiful roads that we just rode over, and you talk about heroin and it doesn't work. It just sort of -- it doesn't seem right, but it's a tremendous problem here and it's a tremendous problem all over the country. And we're going to close up that border, we're going to build a wall. You know, we got the ICE endorsement just yesterday. ICE, great people. <APPLAUSE> And we got the Border Patrol endorsement and the Border Patrol agents endorsed 16,500. And Sheriff Joe endorsed us -- Sheriff Joe -- tough. Sheriff Joe is tough and good. But getting ICE yesterday was a tremendous thing for us. So, I just want to make a quick remark and then we'll start with Howie, and I know it's very hot in here and we want to keep this small. And by the way, they were saying this is practice this Sunday. This is isn't practice. This has nothing to do with Sunday. We're are just here because we just wanted to be here. And you know, Hillary, frankly, they talk about debate prep. It's not debate prep, she's resting, she's resting. <LAUGHTER> And I want to be with the American people. I want to be with the people from New Hampshire, and she wants to rest. <APPLAUSE> Debate prep. Tonight we'll discuss many issues of great importance to New Hampshire and few states in America have been hurt worse by the trade policies of my opponent, and you know that. NAFTA has been a disaster, signed by her husband. And you've lost nearly one in three jobs, think of it. I mean, think of it, one in three jobs since NAFTA and China made deals. We made deals with China, World Trade Organizations, what a disaster that was, supported by Hillary Clinton. But the NAFTA deal signed by her husband, although he did a great thing two days ago when he was willing to say how bad Obamacare was. That was crazy. <APPLAUSE> That was pretty good. The open border policies, and I just wrote this out but I feel it's so important, the open border policies of Hillary Clinton including catch and release, another terrible practice, have allowed a massive influx of drugs into New Hampshire and frankly, into states all over our country -- almost every state. And it's really fueled the tremendous heroin and drug crisis that we have. We're going to close up those borders folks, believe me, and I promise that to you, in New Hampshire more than anything else, I said and I talk about it no matter where I go when I mentioned this state. Because it was really the first glimpse I got of how serious a problem we have. They're poisoning our youth, they're poisoning more than our youth. They're poisoning everybody. But they are poisoning our youth. It's tough enough out there. Our youth that doesn't have a chance with what's happening and we're not going to let it happen anymore. And we're going to help the people that are so badly addicted. We're going to help them. <APPLAUSE> So, I'm going to bring your jobs back -- jobs are leaving like you've never seen before, record levels. I'm going to stop the drugs from coming in. I'm going to create school choice and we're going to get rid of common core, which is a disaster. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to create something very special for every disadvantaged child in this country of which, we have far too many. We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Which Bill admitted this week is a crazy system. Could you believe that? Hey, at least he's honest. Boy, has he suffered. Can you imagine? <LAUGHTER> Can you imagine that? Has he suffered? But he said it's a crazy system that doesn't make sense and doesn't work, and where people end up with premiums doubled and coverage cut in half. I couldn't have said it better myself. I've been saying it -- hey, I've been saying it for two years, longer. I know, I'm going to put him on the campaign. Oh, I'm sure -- do you think anybody has called him and said let's recheck? He did a minor retraction, but you can see he was unhappy about it. Remember Jonathan Gruber. Do we remember the name? I don't ever forget. Jonathan Gruber the architect of the bill admitted it was sold on lies. Remember that? He thought he was talking to his friend. Unfortunately, he's friend turned out not to be such a good friend because his friend had a little cell phone -- those cell phones are brutal, just like e-mails are brutal unless you want to delete them all. <LAUGHTER> Unless you delete about 33,000. <APPLAUSE> But Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare admitted it was sold on lies, and talked about the stupidity of the American voter, right? Remember that, the stupidity of the American voter? The only stupidity was that the politicians, who ignored the American people and forced this thing, absolutely forced it down their throats and Hillary Clinton wants to double down. She wants to make it even worse. I mean, that's ultimately what's going to happen. And me, you've seen what we're going to do. In a much, much better health care at a much lower price and people are going to be very happy, extremely happy. And we're going to take care of those that are disadvantaged and can't afford to do what others can afford to do. But you're going to be spending -- and we're going to take care of them better than they're being taken care of now. But you're going to have health care that works, you're going to have health care where companies compete to get your business, and they'll come up with plans that you haven't even seen or thought about right now. It will be a beautiful thing to see. And I'm sure we'll be talking about it on Sunday night during the debate because there's no way we'll lose this issue. It's a disaster. Obamacare is a disaster. <APPLAUSE> We're going to create a more honest government, our government is a disaster. How about the $1.7 billion in cash that was given to Iran? Cash. Remember it was going to be $400 million, turned out to be $1.7 billion in cash. You know what that is? That's more than this room. You would put it probably in hundreds, although it was all different currencies from different nationalities. Maybe they didn't want American dollars. <LAUGHTER> They said, anybody so stupid to make a deal like this, we don't want their money. But can you imagine this, these people? They never saw anything like it. And by the way, that's not going to fight terror. They got plenty of money that they'll use. That's going to their Swiss bank accounts, OK, just in case you had any questions, all right. Anyway, we gave it to them, and boy, did we give it to them. So, I want to let you know that we are going to be a country that's going to be run properly and I'm going to be -- by the time this finishes, I'll be in for tremendous amounts of money, tremendous amounts of money that I fund myself. We also have a lot of wonderful people, in terms of small donations and that's coming in fantastically. We have some people that just feel very good about our country under proper leadership. But we're spending a lot of money and we're doing it ourselves and we're very proud of it. We're going to be very proud of our country, and when people call up to ask for certain favors that are bad for the country but good for them -- the nice part I don't even have to take their phone call. I don't need them. I don't have to take their phone call. <APPLAUSE> Before we go any further, I want to send our thoughts and hearts with all of the people, and prayers, to the millions in the path of what's now known as Hurricane Matthew. It looks like it's a big one and it's going to be a bad one it looks like. Hopefully it takes that right turn, but it looks like it's going the opposite direction, not good. It's one of the strongest storms to hit in many decades, and our neighbors in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas are in a direct path, it seems. Southeast Florida is taking the brunt. We have a lot of friends in Florida, a lot of buildings, a lot of investments in Florida. A lot of great employees in Florida. Southeast Florida is taking the brunt of the storm. To all of my friends in Florida, please know we are praying for you and everyone in the path, you got to take care of yourself. You've got to get out of the area. You've got to listen. You have a great governor, Governor Scott, and you got to listen because it could be a really, really bad one. So, it's going to be a rough couple of days and maybe beyond that but we'll see what the path ultimately is. We've seen the damage throughout the Caribbean and Cuba, the Bahamas, Haiti and others. In fact, they say in Haiti, almost 270 people -- they think around 270 have already been killed by this terrible storm. So, to the folks in Haiti and all over, we're going to be helping you. We'll be with you and we send our best wishes and prayers. We have a tremendous problem that I think is brewing right now as we speak here. So, we'll know in about four or five hours. I just spoke to Rick Scott and Governor Christie just spoke to Rick Scott and it looks like four or five hours away so, we'll know. But whatever happens, we're with everybody because it looks like it's going to be a very bad one, maybe the worst in a long period of time. OK, with that, Howie Carr has been amazing. He's been very -- I don't know if he's allowed support but he sounds like he supports me a lot. <APPLAUSE> I'm not sure if he's allowed to. <APPLAUSE> I'm not sure he's allowed to but I think probably. But he certainly been amazing, and he's a very talented guy and he's a terrific guy with a terrific family. So when we came up and a lot of people wanted us to do this, we said let's get Howie. So, Howie, let's got. You have some questions.
<CARR: I do and I have a clock down on the floor there that says two minutes.>
<TRUMP:> OK.
<CARR: Now, if you want me to call you when it goes over two minutes like...>
<TRUMP:> I'll tell you what, I'll make a you a deal. If I'm doing well, don't call me. If I'm answering the question poorly, please call me immediately. In fact you can go...
<CARR: OK.>
<TRUMP:> You could go in 30 seconds, you could do it, all right.
<CARR: All right.>
<TRUMP:> All right.
<CARR: All right.>
<TRUMP:> OK, got it.
<CARR: OK, the first question -- some of these I have the names and if I have the name I'll just ask the person to stand up. This is Matthew in Bedford, New Hampshire. Matthew.>
<TRUMP:> Where is Matthew?
<QUESTION: Matthew here.>
<TRUMP:> Hi Matthew.
<CARR: OK, Matthew says after the first debate, the media and even some within the party suggested that you should have gone after Hillary more. Did you hold back, and do you plan on criticizing her more this weekend?>
<TRUMP:> Yeah, I did hold back. I thought it was just inappropriate to say what I was really thinking I would say. And I held back I think for good reason -- I think for good reason. I'd much rather have it be on policy and I didn't like getting into the gutter and so I did hold back. I also, I mean honestly, this was, you know, the commission, the so-called commission on presidential debates. Give me a break. Did you see where they came from? One of them comes from the Hillary camp, the head person.
<QUESTION: How's your microphone work?>
<TRUMP:> Well, this microphone is wonderful. <LAUGHTER> But I had a problem with the mic. We had a guy inside the room oscillating my mic. Was it that the mic didn't work? And you know it's interesting, I went there a little bit before and I said, boy, the mic the is so great. Unfortunately when I went to talk they turn the mic up and down. And you saw it -- everybody in the room saw it so we had a real problem. And the head of the debate said, you're right it was a serious problem -- told this to Mayor Giuliani. It was a serious problem after the debate, an hour and a half. He said, and now that the debate is over I'm going backstage to find out what was wrong. And I said, great that helped. <LAUGHTER> But I felt that -- I really felt that I wanted to keep it on as higher level as possible. Let's see what happens. I mean, let's see what happens. I think we're all better off if we can do that because it is about issues, it is about policies. <APPLAUSE>
<CARR: You kept it at a minute twenty.>
<TRUMP:> Good.
<CARR: What do you see is the biggest foreign-policy failures of the last 15 years?>
<TRUMP:> Wow. DO we have about 24 hours to talk about this? Look, we've had failures at every level. We've had failures -- I think the Iran deal is one of the worst deals I've ever seen, OK. It's going to lead to nuclear weapons. I was with Bibi Netanyahu the other day and we talked and we talked about it, and not to reveal what he said, but I will tell you, I can tell you what I said. This is horrible for Israel. It's horrible for our country. It's a horrible deal because over a period of time, over a short period of time, it leads to -- within 10 years there's going to be some of them <ph>, then they're going to end up with nuclear weapons and they have like a path. On top of it, we gave them back $150 billion. We obviously paid ransom for our hostages, obviously, and Obama said this had nothing to do -- well, why did they delay it until all this money came in? But most importantly, it's just a bad deal, and I'm all for this because I happen to think that nuclear is just about the biggest problem that we have in the world today. I think it's one of -- you know, Obama thinks its global warming. I think it is nuclear in the hands of the wrong players. This is devastating. There is no winner. There's never going to be a winner with nuclear, believe me. And so I think deals are fine, but they have to be good deals. The deal made by Secretary Kerry -- never left the table -- he just agreed, agreed, agreed. He'd want something then says no and he'd agree. So sad but there is one example of a just horrible, horrible thing. We should never have gone into Iraq -- we should have never gone into Iraq. But of equal importance or most equal importance is the way we got out. Obama took us out with Hillary Clinton, create this incredible vacuum. ISIS was formed, a lot of different problems happened and totally destabilized. You know, the surge, whether you are in favor of going in or not, the surge really did work. Then all of a sudden, boom. And not only that, we announced always we're leaving here, we're leaving them, how about Mosul? Did you see Mosul where they announced yesterday -- I'm seeing all about we're going to attack Mosul -- we're going to attack Mosul. I mean, why do they say that? Now, a lot of the bad hombres are in Mosul. The leaders of ISIS -- they think. But they're not there anymore because they say, hey wait a minute, they're going to attack, let's go someplace else. <LAUGHTER> Isn't there an element of surprise? Remember when we were young and we were studying history and they would talk about some of the great generals and great attacks and was called the element of surprise. Wouldn't it be nice if we attacked first and talked about our great victory later? Now, you know, seriously who's going to... <APPLAUSE> It's almost like they're wasting their time attacking Mosul because everyone that we want is going to be gone. You're going to have all civilians and there'll be tremendous death and carnage, but the people that we want, they're going to say, hey -- which are the leaders -- get the hell out of here. It's a very, very sad thing. We are being run by people that are incompetent, I will tell you that. <APPLAUSE>
<CARR: Is Charlene from Sanbornton around? Is she here?>
<TRUMP:> Charlene. Hi.
<CARR: Here we go.>
<TRUMP:> How are you?
<CARR: Charlene says, Mr. Trump, I'm an eighth generation American of Hispanic decent. I live in New Hampshire and California. You have my vote. I want to help other Hispanics see the truth. And then she talks about how with the current administration is the border security sanctuary city or increasing drugs and crime. She says -- Charlene says, what would you say to convince Hispanics who are deceived by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and the biased media to vote for you?>
<TRUMP:> Well, first of all thank you very much and I appreciate it. Interestingly I was listening the other day. There was a gentleman who owns a big radio station, Hispanics mostly -- all Hispanic callers, and he was arguing with one of the hosts. He said, no, you don't understand, the people that are calling in, Hispanics, they love Trump. They're all for Trump. And he said, I was even surprised but now I'm for Trump also. You know, I mean, this is happening more and more. I just got back from Las Vegas where we gave a tremendous -- I mean, we had a tremendous crowd of people. A lot of Hispanics -- Latinos, they like to be called in that area, you know that, right, Hispanics and Latinos. But we had tremendous response and just tremendous -- it was an outpouring of love. And you know, people that are here legally, they don't want people coming across the border illegally taking their jobs, taking their homes, taking whatever they want to take. And we want people to come in now. I want people to come in to our country so bad, but they have to come in legally. You know, we have a country and we have laws. We have a border. And if you don't have a border, you don't have a country. But I think the biggest surprise, two big surprises -- we're going to do great with African-American. You look at what's happening with inner cities, it's a disgrace. And the Democrats have been running them for up to 100 years unbroken. And the African-Americans, believe me, I think we're doing -- and you see how the numbers are changing. One thing they don't have a lot of confidence in Hillary Clinton, she's lied to them for years, she doesn't produce, she just doesn't produce. But I think we're going to do great with the African-Americans. You look at the poverty in the inner cities. You look at the crime in the inner cities. You look at the education -- and there are no jobs -- and we are going to do fantastic with the Hispanics. I believe that. <APPLAUSE>
<CARR: Doing well. Doing well.>
<TRUMP:> We're keeping it down right.
<CARR: Karen Whitaker, from here in Sandown, here in Sandown, Karen.>
<TRUMP:> Hi, Karen. Thank you. Thank you. I like this audience. I like this audience.
<CARR: How do you define the income range for middle-class? It cannot be based on where you live because the U.S. tax codes do not discriminate based on geography.>
<TRUMP:> Well, look, the way I look at it, the middle-class has been forgotten in this country. Taxes are too high, jobs have been taken away from you, a lot of our companies -- a lot of great companies have left our country. They have gone to Mexico and other places. China is making so much of our product, we don't make any product anymore anywhere near like we used to. And I will tell you, such a great question, because our middle-class has been treated so badly by the politicians. I mean, just like forgotten. And we are lowering taxes, as you know, way down for the middle class. We're changing the tax structure completely. We had seven brackets, now we have three. And we are bringing it down actually for those making not a lot at zero. And we don't want them to send in because that's huge bureaucratically and extremely costly, but we are bringing the rates down to numbers that are much lower. You have seen the numbers, much lower. And you're going to have a much lower tax base. Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes way up. I don't even know what she's thinking. We are already the highest taxed nation in the world. Just about, they can maybe find every once a while, they'll fact check me. Well, now there's a nation that you never heard of. We are slightly higher -- we are just about of the industrialized nations, we're the highest taxpayers in the world. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Our business taxes are going to be brought from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're cutting regulations which are -- we want regulation for environmental. We want regulation for safety. But the regulations are massive, Howie, their massive. And we're cutting the regulations at a tremendous clip and I would say 70 percent of the regulations can go. It's just stopping businesses from growing. And I think you're going to see a tremendous change in this country. We're going to see jobs come back. We're going to see companies come back into our country. And right now they're just leaving. It's a one-way street out. We have a one-way street right out of the country and they are going largely to Mexico and other places, but Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world. I tell this story a lot, I have a friend who builds plants and he builds these massive plants and he says Donald, you have to see what's going on in Mexico. I said, how about our country? He goes, not so much. We're going to switch that around a little bit and we'll get along great with Mexico by the way. But we've got to switch that around. It's been a one-way highway out of the United States.
<CARR: Is Capa See (ph) in Londonderry here? Capa? I recently graduated Magna Cum Laude with a B.S. in chemistry and I'm having a lot of trouble finding a job. What's your plan to bring jobs back to America?>
<TRUMP:> Well, that's the biggest problem and that takes place with so many. And even though it's over 100 degrees in this room, I don't feel it, but you know, this room was not meant for this many people, you do know that, right. I heard the other night, I was making a speech and we had tremendous, massive crowds and it was really hot. So, I'm a little warm and there might've been a little bit of sweat and one of these dishonest people said Donald Trump was sweating. And I said, sweating? It was 100 degrees. <LAUGHTER> And guess what, we're all sweating tonight also, right? But that's OK. That's good. That's healthy. The biggest problem you have is people got to college, I mean, that's great getting out now, that's fantastic. That means real smart. But people go to college, they borrow money, they're up to here. They're up to their neck in debt. And then they get out and they can't get a job. I mean, it's such a massive problem. They can't get a job because our really good jobs are gone, and they've gone to other countries. And so many other countries are making our product. I want to see the day when you can get those great marks and that incredible profession, which you love probably, or you wouldn't have been so high up in the class, right, at the top? But I want to see the day when we can have those jobs back in this country at the highest level. I want to see the day when Apple will make their iPhones in this country, instead of making them in China, in Vietnam, and all over the place, OK. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And believe me, if I'm president that's going to happen. And I use Apple as an example but in all fairness, Apple makes all this products all over the place, they're not making them here, mostly in China, now Vietnam which is becoming very strong for this. They're going to start making them here. They're going to start making them here. We have the most people. We have the most unbelievable people. If I learned one thing in going around, we started on June 16th of last year and I've gotten to know the people and we have by far the biggest rallies that people have seen, far bigger than Bernie, and he was second -- but far bigger. Not that Bernie's aren't so big, by the way -- they're very small. Bernie made a big mistake by the way. Bernie Sanders would have been legendary if he didn't make a deal with the devil. When he made that deal, his stock went way down, it went way down. I mean honestly, even as somebody that is, you know, disagrees with him on a lot of things, other than trade, we agree very much on trade, very, very much on trade, except I will do things about it because I like free trade but I want to make a great deal in free trade. But he was right on trade because our country is being ripped off of jobs and everything. But we're going to have a country that makes product again. We're going to have a country that Apple and these other great companies are going to make their product in our country, and we're going to have lots of people working, including yourself. We have to do that. OK? Thank you. <APPLAUSE>
<CARR: Is Bob Swanson here? Bob Swanson?>
<TRUMP:> Hi Bob.
<CARR: It's one of my favorite questions. When you become president, can you assure the American people that you are going to clean House from the top, at the FBI, Justice Department, State Department, and the V.A. and in what order would you start? (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Well, I guess we'll be talking about this for a while to come, but I have to tell you it's one of the saddest things I've ever seen happen to our country. What's happened with Hillary Clinton, where you send e-mails, where they send a subpoena, and they want all of your e-mails, I mean, if you're in private business and you do what she did, it is called the <inaudible>, OK. The United States Congress -- Congress sends a subpoena wanting e-mails and she gets the subpoena and she deletes 33,000 e-mails, and many other things including lying all over the place. And you see people who have suffered greatly, including General Petraeus for doing a tiny fraction of what she did. That's only -- we can't stay here all night and talk about it, but the lies she told to Congress -- the lies she told to the people -- but the lie she told to Congress. And then you see the FBI give her a no tape, no anything, no swearing in. I believe they said no swearing -- you don't have to even swear in. And they questioned her on the 4th of July, and then they released their finding on Labor Day, right before Labor Day when everyone is gone. They're gone here, they're gone there. I think what's happened with respect to, because I have such respect for the people in the FBI and I have such incredible respect for the FBI. What's happened to the FBI and to the Justice Department at the highest level, honestly, I think it's one of the saddest things I've ever seen in this country. Whether we like it or don't like it, to look at what's happened and to look at the way that's been handled, and you know, every time I speak, this is mentioned as subject and the people are going crazy. The people of this country are very, very angry -- very, very, angry. And I would think, I don't know this, but I would think that some of these great FBI agents and the people that work within the FBI, I would imagine they are just furious as to what has happened to the reputation of the FBI. So, I mean, I think it is an amazing question. Honestly, it's like we are a third world country. It is one of the saddest things that I have ever seen happen in this country, and it happened to justice and that's probably I guess the way you feel also? Yes, it is very sad.
<CARR: We have some quick follow up, what would you do with Comey?>
<TRUMP:> I just am very disappointed. I mean, you know, when he read the charges and he's going one, two, three, four, and I'm saying, wow, they're going to do the right thing. And then, he goes, essentially, however, it was, I mean, it was amazing -- it was amazing. To go after point after point, and that was only a few of them. So, it is very disappointing. It's very disappointing.
<CARR: Sharon Osbourne from Auburn? Sharon? Sharon? For the conservative holdouts, Mr. Trump, who are not on the Trump bandwagon yet, what can you say to convince them that your support for traditional conservative issues of free markets, the Bill of Rights and the rest of the constitution mean they should endorse you?>
<TRUMP:> Well, you know, we don't have too many Howie. I'll be honest with you. You know, the press likes to report we have some of these long-term people that have done such a bad job. Look at the problem our country is in. I would never use these people and they know that. So then they announce in a group that they're going over to Hillary, right? You understand, and they announce in the group. But you know, we have tremendous support, including a couple of your very distinguished folks from New Hampshire who were against me, who are now for me. And you are allowed to announce their names, but we have tremendous support in New Hampshire. One of them was very tough and very smart. Go ahead.
<CARR: John Sununu.>
<TRUMP:> That's true. I've watched him and I said, boy, he's tough.
<CARR: His son is four points up.>
<TRUMP:> Oh, that's good. Well, that's good because I'm -- I mean, I thought it was terrific. I met him the other day and -- father and son -- and I think they're great people, but he was tough. I tell you what, he was really hunting for Trump. And you know what, I respect for somebody that can go other way. It's not that easy to pivot, as you would say. But I very much appreciate the Sununu family and the fact that they are with me and I am with them, and they're going to do very well. He's going to do very well and I see the numbers. And you know, one of the things that have really happened, they all thought oh, Trump -- because look, I've never done this but I've done very well in my life and business and did a lot of good things, but I've never done this. Saw all of the reports, well, you'll take down the senator and you'll take down this senator. You know how well the Republicans are doing? I guess there is a gentleman in Illinois that's not doing so well. This guy was actually taking out ads against me. I said, are you sure he's a Republican, maybe he's a Democrat? And he's not doing well, but hey, that's his problem. I mean, you know, he was not for me. But if you look at -- and that was for political reasons -- but if you look at what is going on, now they're all talking about -- in fact, the other day I saw very interestingly one of the announcer, you know, Donald Trump is having a very positive effect on these races. The Republicans are going to hold. They're doing terrifically well, far better than anyone thought. And frankly, we are winning states and we're going to win some states that would never in a million years -- you know this, be in play. I mean, we have some states like, we're doing great in Colorado, and somebody else wouldn't do well. Nobody else would do well. We're doing great. I think we're leading Colorado in one of the polls as you know just came out. We're leading Colorado. I just left. We're leading a lot of places and we're doing at least very competitively in a lot of states that absolutely would not be for Republicans. And, you know, one of the funny things, they do the maps, and remember to -- I've watched the different people that do the maps and they're very small path. It's tougher for the Republicans, I have to tell you. But they said there's very small path but I was watching the other day and the same person was saying, wow, this path is getting a lot wider. Doesn't mean they were happy about it, but the path now, there are four different paths, before there was one little one.
<CARR: Nate Silver.>
<TRUMP:> Well, Nate Silver has been, you know, he didn't predict us in the primary and he had never called a loser before. I mean, you know, he's always been on the right side of what happened, in terms of at least his predictions and he didn't predict me in the primaries and in all fairness, you know, he's never seen me, never spoke to me, never saw what we did. You know, we had 17 very talented people and one by one by one, it was a beautiful sight to watch, wasn't it? Beautiful. And by the way, Howie, those people, most of them endorse me, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, so many of them endorse me and they are great endorsements. Scott Walker has been incredible.
<CARR: He helped Pence.>
<TRUMP:> He helped Pence too. Mike Pence by the way has been fantastic and he did a great job last night. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> He did a great job last night.
<CARR: That brings me to another question from Lois from Bretwood. Lois?>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, Lois.
<CARR: Did you really say, Lois asks you, were you upset about Mr. Pence's debate success, as John Harwood said?>
<TRUMP:> John Harwood was the worst moderator out of all the debates we had. How many did we have, 11 or 12? He was so bad. This guy knows nothing about me. I was so happy -- and I saw it today that somebody on CNN, the Clinton News Network, who knows nothing about us, you know, they used John King actually. He's a nice guy. I like him on the maps. He does a good job with the maps. I like them better now than I did a couple months ago because a couple of months ago I had no chance, now all of a sudden that map is getting very red. But John King said... <APPLAUSE> You know, they always have a source, they always have a source, a source with -- nobody talks to him. Nobody talks because he is like the enemy. He's like the enemy. But he said, and a few other people said Donald Trump was at first happy and then he was unhappy because Mike Pence did so well. I said, unhappy? We're jumping up and down. He was so good -- and I tell you what, he's a great human being. You can't root against him, you can't. <APPLAUSE> I was telling Chris Christie, I said, can you imagine these people are saying that I would have loved to, you know, see him not do well because that makes me look better? These people, that is why a guy like John King has stayed in the same position for like, how long has been at CNN? I used to say I think someday he'll be an anchor, guess what? He is still doing the maps. But no, I was so happy, I mean, I can give you my word on this. I was so happy that Mike did well and I was rooting him on we were talking all during the day and I was giving him some ideas and we were running things by each other. And it's so disconcerting when you -- even tonight they said Donald Trump is going to New Hampshire to practice for Sunday. This has nothing to do with Sunday. It's like they make you like a child. I love the people of New Hampshire. This was set up a little while ago. They were going to cancel it, and I said why are you going to cancel it? Well, you want a debate prep. I said, forget debate prep. I mean, give me a break. Do you really think that Hillary Clinton is debate prepping for three or four days? Hillary Clintons is resting, OK. She's resting. She wants to build up her energy for Sunday night and you know what, that's fine. But the narrative is so foolish. I'm here for one reason. I love the people of New Hampshire. I said I was going to be here and I'm here. Very simple. <APPLAUSE>
<CARR: This one is unsigned but it's a good question.>
<TRUMP:> That's trouble.
<CARR: What advice would you give to young Americans looking to achieve the American dream?>
<TRUMP:> Always go into what you love doing. And you may have parents that are trying to push you one way or another but you know what you love. You have to do what you love. And I say this all the time, I say it in speeches and everything, I mean, I will speak in front of young people because I love doing it and I say always follow your dream. Always go into what you love. And never, ever quit or give up. I've seen a lot of people over the years, big people and not so big, usually it's not so big because if they quit they're not going to get so big, but the most successful people I've ever met are the people that never quit, they never give up. They just don't take no for an answer. So do something that you really love doing because that is not work and never, ever quit or give up. Do one or two more Howie. <APPLAUSE> Thank you.
<CARR: I think you've dealt with this one before. It's from Al Baldazaro (ph) over there.>
<TRUMP:> Hello, Al.
<CARR: Stand up Al. Al wants to know... (APPLAUSE)>
<CARR: Al wants to know what you're going do about the V.A. How are you going to make it possible?>
<TRUMP:> Well, the veterans, as Al can tell you and there are a lot of veterans in this room because I recognize some of you and I've become very close to the vets and a lot of it started with New Hampshire to be honest and Iowa, but I really got close to the vets. And I'll tell you what, in many cases, they're living in hell. What is going on with the Veterans Administration between the corruption, the long, long waits, 22 suicides a day. I thought that was a typo. When I heard 22 suicides a day, I said that's impossible. Twenty-two suicides a day. Much of it caused by the fact that they can't get to see doctors. Howie, they wait in line for five and six days and at the end of the six day, the doctor says sorry, you know, I'm going on vacation. And actually the Veterans Administration and the vets tell me this, they have some really great doctors, but getting to see them is sometimes almost impossible. We are going to solve finally the problem of the Veterans Administration. We have illegal immigrants that in many cases are treated better than our great veterans and you know that and everybody knows that. They're being treated better than our veterans, and that's not going to happen. One of the things we're going to do is the lines are impossible. Getting to see a doctor is in many cases just days and days. When that circumstance happens, we're going to let our veterans go across the street, around the corner, two miles away, and see a doctor, private or a hospital, public or private, where they are looking for work where they have wonderful people and they're looking for work, take care of their problem and we will pay the bill. And that's going to be the cheapest thing we can do. It's going to be the cheapest thing we can do. <APPLAUSE> And Al can tell you a lot of the vets that I recognize in the room, they can tell you everybody is in love with the plan. And we're going to keep the V.A., but -- we're going to keep the Veterans Administration, we're going to keep the hospitals, we're going to keep the buildings because I think that's important. You know, we have to take care of our vets. These are people that we wouldn't be here if it weren't for the vets. But when they're waiting in line and they know there is no end in sight, and honestly, they're dying. They need a simple procedure, they need a prescription, they need something very easy, and they end up dying and it's a very sad thing. So, they're going to be able to go across the street to a public or private hospital, to a doctor, and we're going to take care of our vets. For the first time, we're really going to take care of our vets, OK. <APPLAUSE>
<CARR: Is Pete from Nashua here? Pete from Nashua? Pete from Nashua says Hillary Clinton wants to give Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through citizenship. Won't this bankrupt the program?>
<TRUMP:> Well, let me tell you, you've heard that and most people didn't even believe it but that's true. And you know, she's open border. She wants people to just flow through -- look, when the Border Patrol agents, 16,500, and when ICE, when they come up -- and they've never endorsed a presidential candidate before, but these are great people that want to do their jobs. You know, it's much harder for them to do their jobs to just stand back. Right now, its stand back and let them in. It's much and catch and release which is a disaster. But when they want to do their jobs and it's much more difficult and they come out and endorse Trump, who's going to have them do their jobs? And we're going to build the wall, and we're going to stop things from coming in. Look, we're going to stop -- and this was the pledge I made to New Hampshire, more than any other place because this is where I really couldn't believe it. But I said if I win and I become president, first got the nomination -- that happened -- become president, I promise the people of New Hampshire that we are going to stop this crap from coming into your state 100 percent, 100 percent. And it can be done, and it can be done even before the wall goes up. The wall is a necessary edge. You know, I asked the patrol, I asked really the ICE folks that endorsed me, and I asked the Border Patrol folks that endorsed me. I said, how important is the wall? And you know, I'm so committed to the wall, I was pretty sure they were going to say this, but I wasn't 100 percent, they said Mr. Trump, it is absolutely necessary for us to do our proper job, which made me, you know, gave me a little additional security as far as the wall is concerned. We need the wall. We have to stop the drugs, heroine, but mainly drugs, but we have to stop the drugs from pouring into our country. And believe me it is poisoning our country and it's poisoning our youth. And we're going to stop it and we're going to stop it fast long before the wall gets up. We're going to start that wall fast. I get them built fast. But I tell you, long before, we're going to stop that poison from flowing into our country, OK? One more. We'll do another question.
<CARR: I'm going to ask you the kind of question Hillary Clinton gets sometimes. I mean easy here.>
<TRUMP:> She gets easy once.
<CARR: That's what I mean.>
<TRUMP:> Do you ever notice, by the way, did you see the difference. I'm getting boom, boom, boom, with here, what would you do to fix the economy? Well, of course, that's actually a much tougher question than you would understand, and she doesn't have a clue, but you see the questions I was getting.
<CARR: Laura from Hampton, New Hampshire, are you here? That's Laura.>
<QUESTION: I thought you needed a fun question.>
<TRUMP:> Let's have a fun question.
<CARR: What is one of your earliest memories as a child and why do you think it stands out, and then she says, go Donald. >
<TRUMP:> Thank you, thank you. I think just the relationship I had with my parents. You know, my father built houses in Brooklyn and Queens and the apartments. And he was a very good negotiator. I'd sit at his knee, and it wasn't that he taught me. He didn't really say, son, you have to learn, but he'd be on the telephone negotiating with a plumber or an electrician or a sheet rocker, and I would hear this and I'd be playing with blocks at his knee on the floor and I'd be listening, and it was always so vivid. And he was always negotiating and you know what, that's what we need in this country because people are running away with our country. You look at what's going on, whether it's the border, whether it's our depleted military -- the greatest people on earth are military people, but they have old equipment. You saw the piece they did on many of the networks where they show fighter jets with their 18 years old. They're so old that they don't make the parts anymore. These are fighter jets that our people are flying now and they have to go into plane graveyards. They have to go into graveyards to get parts and they have to go into museums to get parts because they don't make the parts anymore. Now, we need a strong military. We need to protect our Second Amendment. We need to take care of our vets. We need borders. We need great education, getting rid of common core, so important. We need so many things, and by the way, one thing, and I know John Sununu and a lot of other people felt this was so important when they came out so strongly, United States Supreme Court. We need -- we lost a great justice, Justice Scalia. Great justice -- we need great justices, who are going to uphold our Constitution. And if Hillary Clinton gets in, you're going to have a much different country. So, so many people feel that's so important, I personally feel it's one of the most important things. Defense always being we have to defend our country, and we have to stop people coming in from parts of the world where they're looking to do us harm, believe me. And they're pouring in and Hillary Clinton wants to have them come in at a rate of 550 percent more than President Obama. We're going to stop it. And you know the statement, ""We are going to make America great again."" And it is going to happen quickly. <APPLAUSE> So, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
<CARR: I got one more question for you Donald. I'm going to let you read it and remember where you are tonight as you answer this question.>
<TRUMP:> The World Series, you know, look, of is course it's Boston. <APPLAUSE>
<CARR: Thank you, Donald Trump. Give Donald Trump a big hand. Give a big stand on New Hampshire. Round of applause. Donald J. Trump, the next president of the United States. Thank you, Donald Trump. Good luck to Florida. Good luck in Wisconsin tomorrow and good luck in St. Louis on Sunday night. Thank you, Donald J. Trump. Give him a big hand as he leaves.

<date:""2016-10-10"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And we love Big Ben. Big Ben's a friend. <APPLAUSE> We play golf together. He once hit a shot that went head <ph> right into a tree. It was a massive tree like this. The ball hit the tree so hard, I swear I said, Ben, within two years, that's tree's going to be dead. And you know what? Two years later, he's shooting the same. It's because we have <inaudible> here. <LAUGHTER> But two years later, that tree was dead. <LAUGHTER> He is a strong guy, and he's good guy too. Big Ben. <APPLAUSE> So I'm thrilled to be back in Pennsylvania. Great place. I went to school in Pennsylvania. November 8th, we're going to win this state and we're going to win back the White House. <APPLAUSE> We're going to take on the special interests, the corrupt media -- and it is corrupt -- and the career politicians that have stolen your jobs, your wealth and stolen our middle class. They've stolen our middle class. We're going to make Pennsylvania rich again by bringing back our jobs. We'll bring back our jobs. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue about how to bring back jobs, that I can tell you <inaudible>. She doesn't have a clue. If she wanted to, she couldn't do it. You know, in New York state, she ran for the Senate. And you know what, the state New York is a disaster for jobs. And she said, ""I'm going to bring back 200,000 jobs."" Guess what? Right down the tubes, worse today than ever before. How many have watched the debate last night? <APPLAUSE> Good <inaudible>. We had a lot of fun. And I would say that Hillary is highly overrated. <APPLAUSE> It was fun watching <inaudible>. I mean, most of us <inaudible> unanimous decisions. But some of these people, they were so pain -- it was like a painful experience. But we're fighting for you, so what's good for me is good for you. And I mean that totally 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to talk about a lot of things today, but I always want you to remember this above all else. We're going to bring back the jobs to Pennsylvania. We're going to bring back steel. Your steel has been stolen from you in this area. <APPLAUSE> Natural gas, the EPA is killing you and killing your companies and you're losing your jobs. Let me tell you, that's going to turned around on day one if I win. On day one. Your jobs are coming back to Pennsylvania, and they're coming back to this area. And that means we're going to take care of our steel workers and we're going to take care of our miners, believe me. I'm going to take care of you. <APPLAUSE> We laid out a goal, uplifting vision for America. Lower taxes, better trade deals -- I'll give you a purse <ph>. <LAUGHTER> And millions and millions of new jobs. But all crooked Hillary can do was talk about small, petty things last night. During the course of 90 minutes, she was exposed and her values were exposed. She had no defense. All she could do was lie. She lied so much last night. They don't like to catch her on the lies. I explained how Hillary Clinton oversaw the disasters in Libya, including the drawing of the infamous red line. Remember she said, oh, I had nothing -- well, it turned out she was there, by the way. Remember, she said she wasn't there? <BOOING> The red line was actually drawn in August of 2012. No, she was there. She lied about it. She said she wasn't involved in that catastrophe. But that was just one of many. Of course, the moderators didn't call her out and they didn't call out this lie that she told. Hillary Clinton said she didn't delete her e-mails after a congressional subpoena. But she did. That was another lie. That was a hard one to believe. How did she say no to that one? The subpoena -- well, the subpoena was sent on March 4, 2015. Crooked Hillary's e-mails were bleached and destroyed. Now, nobody bleaches them. You know what? Bleaching is so expensive. It's really a very expensive process. But when you bleach them, it pretty much means they're gone. Although I've always heard you can't get rid of e-mails. I've been told you can't. I wonder if the NSA has her e-mails, do you think?
<AUDIENCE: Yeah!>
<TRUMP:> Do you think? I don't think they looked too hard for her e-mails. What do you think, folks? Do you think -- I don't know.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> I'll tell you, I bet -- I don't know this for a fact, but I'll bet within the FBI -- you know, you have some of the greatest Americans in the world that are so proud of the FBI -- and I'll bet you they are sick to their stomachs at what's happening. Sick to their stomachs. <APPLAUSE> Anyway, her e-mails were destroyed somewhere between March 25th and March 31st after the congressional subpoena was received. You know, if you are suing somebody privately and they delete and get rid of all your stuff that you subpoena, you got a very big consequence. You know what the consequence is, right? Here's -- here's the United States Congress -- United States Congress subpoenaing to see e-mails and other things and they're gone. And now, by the way, did you read yesterday? Two boxes of e-mails and materials are now missing.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> Very, very sad. Special prosecutor, here we come, right? <APPLAUSE> If I win, we're going to appoint a special prosecutor because we cannot allow this to happen to our country. We can't. We're like a third world nation. Hillary had no defense for her contract <ph> and didn't even try to defend the ridiculous <inaudible> that these were 30,000 e-mails about yoga and wedding planning. <BOOING> Let's see. You have 30,000 -- 33,000 e-mails deleted, right? I would bet she had three for yoga and maybe five for the wedding, right? What about the rest? She had no defense when I brought up her failures in Iraq, Syria and Libya. She had no defense when I brought up her failures as a senator from New York promising to create the 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. But instead, the jobs were shipped to Mexico and other countries. She had no defense for calling on millions of Americans and then saying that they were deplorable -- that's you, deplorable. That's me, it's all of us. And you know what's worse? Irredeemable. I don't know, which is worse? Would you rather be deplorable? Irredeemable means you have no chance, right? We're deplorable and irredeemable. I don't think so. I think we have the greatest people on Earth. The smartest people. <APPLAUSE> We have the smartest. We have the most loyal people. That's one thing every poll points out that, boy, Trump's people, it's like the most loyal ever. <APPLAUSE> And one thing I know, we're going to get out and vote and we're going to be voting. And you remember the primaries. Donald Trump is behind, voting begins tomorrow, should be very interesting, but it looks like Mr. Trump will not be able to win this state, but he's put up a good fight. Next day, Donald Trump wins by 22 points. Everyone... <APPLAUSE> Crazy deal. Mr. Brexit, Mr. Brexit. Remember I said Brexit's going to happen because I have a lot of property over there. Brexit's going to happen. They all laughed. They said Donald Trump said that Brexit's going to happen. Isn't he ridiculous? Anyway, three days later, they vote, Brexit happens. They never say anything. They never said anything.
<TRUMP:> But that's all right. This is like Brexit, folks. You watch. We want our independence back. We want our borders strong. We don't want people coming in from Syria that we have no idea who the hell they are. <APPLAUSE> As I said last night -- and I mean this -- she's got hatred in her heart. She wants to divide America. I want to bring us together as one people. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, we have thousands and thousands of people outside. You know, that, right? Do you know how lucky you are? Do you know how lucky you are? <APPLAUSE> And I guess they're not allowing them in. I don't know why because there's thousands of people. Where is the fire marshal? Let some more people come in, I see some seats over there. Let some people -- fire marshal, we need your help. <APPLAUSE> Where's our fire marshal? Let them come in. We've got 3,000 or 4,000 people standing out there. See, I guess they figure you folks are taking the seats in the very back. We ought to let some more people come in. <APPLAUSE> I always get a kick -- I mean, I know a lot about fire and fire marshals, but you have a room with four walls and a roof and nothing to burn. Let the people in. <APPLAUSE> Hillary also had no defense for Obamacare, which is a total disaster. I'm going to repeal and replace your disastrous Obamacare. Much cheaper, much better. <APPLAUSE> Hillary had no defense for her secret speeches to Wall Street and international banks that she hid from the public and which were exposed by Wikileaks. And by the way, just as I'm walking on the stage, Mayor Giuliani said you're not going to believe this, look at this, we have all of these new charges. You see it just came down today. Wikileaks, some new stuff, some brutal stuff. I mean, I'd read it to you, but to hell with it, just trust me. It's real bad stuff. <APPLAUSE> The speech transcripts contain scandalous revelations about Hillary Clinton that disqualify her from seeking public office. <APPLAUSE> And she is. She's disqualified just on the fact that she did that with her e-mails. Think of it; deleting 33,000 -- think of it. How can you do it? These transcripts also shine a spotlight on how this corrupt establishment works, where politicians meet in secret with the big banks, collect massive sums of money, then betray the American worker, which is you and me and sort of all of us, we're all workers. We're all working, we just work differently. You know, I tell this to people. We have people in this room right now that made more money 18 years ago than they're making now. They work a lot harder right now than they did 18 years ago. Their job was better 18 years ago and they're older. And the only thing I say is I'm older also, and I've never worked this hard either, folks, I will tell you. That's for sure. <APPLAUSE> My campaign is powered by my money and also small donations from millions of visitors to our website who just want their country back. They want America back. <APPLAUSE> Last night, I asked Hillary Clinton why she doesn't take some of the hundreds of millions of dollars that she made <ph> -- so I'll over $100 million into the campaign of my money. Is that smart or is that stupid?
<AUDIENCE: Smart!>
<TRUMP:> Take some of the money she made selling favors to special interest and invest them in her campaign, instead of having to rely on even more corporate donations. She looked like, oh my god, why did he bring this up? She had no answer. She was flabbergasted, I can tell you. In the secret speeches released by WikiLeaks, this is yesterday and the day before, Hillary -- not as good as today, buy the way -- Hillary Clinton -- but I say that because the press will try not to pick them up because they try and protect her. I'll tell you what, the only thing she's got going in the media. Without the media, she would not have a chance. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton told her Wall Street donors that you need to have a public position and a private position. In other words, you need to be dishonest to run for office. In other words, have one for the public and one for the people that are giving you the money. Right? And that is very much right in that whole thing. I mean, it's crazy. How did Hillary Clinton try to defend this shocking admission? She did not deny -- she said this awful thing. Instead she blamed honest Abe Incon <ph>. Honest Abe! <BOOING> So Hillary Clinton for lying, blamed Abe Lincoln, commonly known as honest Abe. He's spinning in his grave. The speeches also show that crooked Hillary supports cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits, one more example of how Hillary Clinton's public position is a lie. She wants to knock the hell out of your Social Security, she wants to knock the hell out of your Medicare/Medicaid. And I'm going to save them, OK? This is a little reversal for the Democrat/Republican, but I am going to save them <ph> because we're going to make -- we're going to make our country rich again. We're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to make good trade deals. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have countries that we are defending all over the world pay a little bit more money, if that is OK. <APPLAUSE> Which, in all fairness, until I came along, you never even heard about that. Right? And then when I say that they say, oh, Trump does not want to defend Japan. No, I'd love to defend, but let them pay a little more money, right, isn't that good? We're dying <ph>, we're going to have $20 trillion in debt, $20 trillion. So some of these countries that we do such a good job for, where we defend them -- and we love doing it, but they got to help us out a little bit. Right? Most shockingly, these speeches show Hillary Clinton saying, quote, my dream is a hemispheric common market <ph>with open trade -- you know what that does to your community? That's the end. And open borders! <BOOING> In other words, she wants the United States to surrender to global governance <ph> with no controls over trade or immigration. Great. Can you imagine? Seriously. Can you imagine? She's saying she's for NAFTA, which she was. You know, her husband signed NAFTA. But she's also for Trans-Pacific Partnership By the way, NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made in the history -- not of this country, but of the world. What it's done to Pennsylvania and Ohio and update New York and New England. Poor New England, what it's done to New England. So she's for radical, unlimited immigration. In other words, people are going to pour in <ph>, but that's what she's for. I'm building a wall and she's for, like, come on across. Slight difference. <APPLAUSE> A slight difference. We're going to build a wall. Who is going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> By the way, they may not know it yet, but I think they're getting the idea. But when you think of it, she wants to have people pour across. Now, the border patrol agents, 16,500, endorsed me recently. And last week... <APPLAUSE> Never endorsed a presidential candidate before in long history. And last week, ICE endorsed. ICE is -- these are great people. These are people that want to do their jobs, but they're told to stand back, don't do your job. These are great people. You know, it'd be a lot easier for them if they didn't endorse me because they could just take it nice and easy. But they want -- so, we got ICE, we have the border patrol agents, we have Sheriff Joe from Arizona. We love Sheriff... <APPLAUSE> And Hillary Clinton's got nothing. So she wants people to pour across the borders. She wants thousands and thousands of people to come in from Syria. I mean, 550 percent more than our President Obama. <BOOING> A Trump administration will completely renegotiate NAFTA or we will walk away and make a brand-new deal that's far better where actually businesses start coming to Pennsylvania and to Ohio. <APPLAUSE> Unbelievable. And we will stop the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing could be as bad. But we'll stop it. And we'll make deals. But this is a complex deal with many countries. You have to see the arrows all over the place. Once you sign it, it's 5,000 pages, more than that long. Once you sign it, it's a mess. I like free trade. We make one deal, two deals, three -- we make it with individual countries, and if they don't behave, we terminate them. We send them what's called a notification of termination. <APPLAUSE> But that will never happen because during that 30-day period, we'll renegotiate a better deal for our country, OK? And you the other way, you can't terminate. There's too many -- it's -- people go crazy. You have to be like a grand chessmaster, and we don't have any of them. Hillary Clinton's radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all, would end the United States as we know it today. <BOOING> No one who supports open borders should be able to run for president because we won't have a country. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, weeks ago, I called out Hillary Clinton for supporting open borders and the media said I was wrong. Now, I've been proven right. Where is the media rushing to correct these false stories? Because in the Wikileaks, it was all about open borders, free trade for everybody. See, I like free trade, but we want smart trade. It's got to be -- it shouldn't even be called free trade, it should be called smart trade. I don't like the term free trade. <APPLAUSE> Because free trade, to have it really work, you need really, really smart people negotiating your details. And all these other countries have smart people. For them, it's important. For us, we have people, they don't know what they're doing. 
<TRUMP:> No less than Bernie Sanders declared that open borders would be the end of America. Bernie Sanders said open borders means there would be no United States, doing away with the concept of nation-state. Sanders also explained how open borders would make everybody in America poorer by radically reducing wages. Maybe that's OK with him. Not OK with me. By the way, how many ways can Hillary Clinton betray Bernie Sanders? She really has betrayed him. I mean, look, even if we don't agree with him, I mean -- you know, Bernie Sanders would have been a legend. He would have gone down as a legendary figure in history if he didn't make the deal with the devil. But he made the deal with her and now he's just another guy. <APPLAUSE> She attacked his supporters as basement dwellers, she admitted in secret she's in favor of entitlement cuts and she's for open borders and open trade. Your state has lost one in three manufacturing jobs. Since Bill and Hillary Clinton's NAFTA and China deals happened. I'm going to stop foreign cheating, the product dumping, which by the way, is killing your steel industry, and in this case has already killed much of your steel industry. How many people agree with me that China -- because this is such a big steel area, or was -- we're gonna bring it back, don't worry about it. But how many people agree with me that China had so much to do and stupid politicians with the killing of the steel industry in the state of Pennsylvania? <APPLAUSE> Between that and currency manipulation, which they do like grand masters and we do like we're playing bad games of checkers, we're going to start making things in America again. And we're going to start making things in Pennsylvania again. Don't let them tell you you're doing well because you're doing lousy. <APPLAUSE> Pennsylvania steel will build our future and Pennsylvania energy -- our miners, we're bringing our miners back -- will power our future. <APPLAUSE> Congressman, get up there, will you? Do we know our Congressman? Look at this guy. I tell you, they say he was a hell of a <ph> football player. They say he was -- I don't know if he'd be so good today. Would you be good today? I don't know. But he has been such an incredible supporter, and so great, and he's standing next to my daughter Tiffany who came today. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, Congressman. Thank you. We have such great support in these areas. That includes, though, clean coal, shale oil and natural gas we have to protect. Pennsylvania workers will be hired to do the job. Hillary Clinton would rather give your jobs to people that pour into the country illegally. I explained how she favors a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our land. We have nothing -- we know nothing about them. And by the way, we all have hearts. We know what's going on. It's horrible. When you look at Syria, when you look at the migration. We'll build safe zones and we'll get others to pay, like the Gulf states. They have nothing but money and they're not putting up their fair share. They have nothing but money. They'll pay. And we'll lead it, but they'll pay. <APPLAUSE> I also exposed how Hillary Clinton is personally responsible for the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into the United States. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton refused to make foreign countries take back their own criminal aliens by canceling visas, a duty vested in her by the law. And I must tell you, she refused to use forceful diplomatic action. So we'll have a killer, and he'll be from another country, let's say someplace in South America, and we'll catch him because our ICE people are great and our border patrol people are amazing, so we'll catch him. And what happens is we'll want to bring him back to whatever country that person comes from. This could be a killer, a drug dealer, somebody else, a gang member, the head of a gang. Hillary Clinton would say, ""We can't force him back into that country."" The hell we can't. <APPLAUSE> I guarantee you that under my administration, there will not be one bad guy that is not forced back into his country. Not one. There won't be any. You won't be reading about it. We will put such pressure on those countries to take these people back. But Hillary Clinton did say -- I'm sorry Madam Secretary, if you can believe this. This was prior to her naps <ph>. I'm sorry, Madam Secretary. But they won't take this killer back. ""Oh, that's OK. Well, bring him back and let him out on our streets."" And you know what happens, right? The Remembrance Project. You know what that is, right? The Remembrance -- these are the most incredible mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers who have lost their loved ones to killers, to killers, illegal immigrants that killed their loved ones. And it's a sad thing to see, that I can tell you. Her refusal to take such diplomatic action has caused the release of thousands of criminals into our community. One foreign national and convicted killer who should have been sent back to his home country in 2012 was instead set free by Clinton's watch. Six months after his release, he killed again, murdering a 25-year old beautiful Casey Chadwick. You probably heard about it. In just one single year of Hillary Clinton's tenure, 2010, nearly 4,000 convicted criminal aliens were released into American communities because their home countries just said, ""No, we're not taking them back. We're not taking them back. Yes, we're supposed to legally. We're not doing it."" So we took them. Another revelation from those secret speeches is that Hillary Clinton knew that the State Department and their devices were under threat of hacking, and yet she traveled overseas with her totally insecure telephone. Remember the ones that she banged the hell out of when she wanted to get get rid of <ph>... <LAUGHTER> ""No I wasn't trying to <inaudible>."" Who banged their phones. When you throw your cell phones, does anybody bang them with a hammer? This is still more evidence that she lied to the FBI, just like she lied to Congress. And she lied to us. One more very important issue where I exposed the hypocrisy of Hillary Clinton, and the media, was on Hillary Clinton's treatment of women. I was getting beaten up for 72 hours on all the networks for inappropriate words 12 years ago. Locker room talk, whatever you want to call it. But I said to myself, wait a minute. And I just saw a very inappropriate words, but Bill Clinton sexually assaulted innocent women and Hillary Clinton attacked those women viciously. One of them said more viciously than he attacked them. If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we'll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things. There are so many of them, folks. You probably saw yesterday we brought four wonderful women to St. Louis. <APPLAUSE> And honestly, it was both very beautiful and very sad. They really -- they've been trying to get their feelings out for so long and the media wouldn't take it. One thing with me, the media takes it. Whatever. So they were able to get what they wanted to get out. To quote Juanita Broaddrick, ""Hillary Clinton threatened me after Bill Clinton raped me."" She's been struggling to get the media to pay attention to her for many, many years. So last night, I decided we would expose the hypocrisy of the Clintons and the media and our politicians to the entire world. <APPLAUSE> As I outlined last night, Bill Clinton was the worst abuser of women ever to sit in the Oval Office. He was a predator. Hillary Clinton systematically attacked and discredited the victims of Bill Clinton's sexual harassment and assault. These things aren't written by the media, but they're true. Written by many books. These victims include names like Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James and Cristy Zercher. And there are many, many more. For decades, Hillary Clinton has been deeply familiar with her husband's predatory behavior, and instead of trying to stop it, she made it possible for him to take advantage of even more women. She put even more women in harm's way and then she goes out and says, ""I love women. I'm going to help women. I'm gonna help women."" She's a total hypocrite. The hypocrisy of the media and our politicians is hard to believe. They condemn my words, but they ignore and defend the -- and this is the way it is -- the reprehensible actions of Hillary and Bill Clinton that have destroyed and hurt so many lives. But perhaps the greatest window into the character of Hillary Clinton can be found in what she did as a lawyer when she was defending a man who raped a 12-year-old little girl. <BOOING> Desperate to win her case, Hillary Clinton blamed the 12-year-old victim. Her name was Kathleen Shelton. She was with us yesterday. She was right sitting front row at the debate. As the lawyer for the rapist, Hillary Clinton said the little girl was emotionally unstable and had a quote, ""tendency to seek out older men and engage in fantasizing."" This is -- Hillary ruined that little girl's life, destroyed her life, then years later she was recorded laughing about it on videotape. She was laughing at the girl. There's nothing Hillary Clinton won't do or say to obtain power, and it's about time people started to understand that. <APPLAUSE> But the hypocrites in the media don't want to talk about what Hillary Clinton has done to these victims. They don't want to talk about what their other political heroes have done to other innocent girls and women. People like Kennedy, Chappaquiddick. We remember that. Driving his car into a pond instead of calling the police, possibly saving her life. In fact, almost definitely being able to save her life. He went home and went to sleep. Did not report the incident to the police for 10 hours, yet he was hailed as a hero.
<TRUMP:> The last 72 hours has framed what this election is all about. It's about the American people fighting back against corrupt politicians who don't care about anything except staying in power and keeping their donors happy. <APPLAUSE> What I want to say to every American right now is that I accept the mantle of this responsibility for all of us, for all of us. <APPLAUSE> We have an absolute incredible situation taking place, folks. And I will never stop fighting for you against the Washington establishment that has betrayed each and every one of you, betrayed the country. Our government has lost its virtue. Right now, it's just about protecting the powerful, and you know what I mean. And I know it better than anybody else. And I'm doing this because I just think it's so damn unfair. <APPLAUSE> And it's ultimately going to lead to the destruction of our country. And we're doing it. The Clintons have corrupted our government at the very highest levels. Rank and file -- incredible people by the way, incredible people -- rank and file FBI agents are shocked at the corruption that they're witnessing at levels of the FBI that nobody would have thought it was possible. The Department of Justice, where Bill Clinton gets into the back of an airplane for 39 minutes just prior to a determination being made. Of course, you and I know the determination was made a long time ago. But gets on with the attorney general because he happened to be in Arizona playing gold. It was 110 degrees out, right? Nobody saw him on the golf course. Just happened to be there. Oh, there's the attorney general. Let me get back on the plane. So they spend 39 minutes in the back of the plane. They talked about two things; golf and grandchildren. Thirty-nine minutes. So I give the grandchildren five minutes, I give the golf three minutes, right? What else do you think might have been talked about? They can't believe, these FBI people, these people for life in the FBI -- these are people that are unbelievable people. They love this country so much. And they're seeing things that they've never seen before where guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, no charge, no problem. They see all of this stuff going on and these people much be sick to their stomachs. What have we seen in the e-mail scandal? What have we seen in third-world-level corruption? This is really what it is. It's third-world -- we're like in a third-world country right now. And this November is our one chance, November 8th, our one chance to save our country. It's the last chance we're going to have, folks. <APPLAUSE> I've traveled around this country talking about change. But my travels, the places I've been, the people I've met, they've also changed me. I'm not proud of everything that I've done in life. I mean, who among us is? Is anybody totally proud of every single element? Some we are. But let me tell you what I'm very proud of. I'm proud that I've always treated the blue collar worker -- and I consider myself in a certain way to be a blue collar worker -- that make this country run with tremendous respect. The waiters and waitresses, the cops and firefighters, the receptionist and the custodians, we treat them with dignity and respect. These are great people. These are great people. <APPLAUSE> And our police and law enforcement officials, we have to be thankful for them because they have done an amazing job. <APPLAUSE> I'm proud of the tens of thousands of jobs that I've created and I'm proud that I provide equal play and equal pay for equal work. And I have to do that, I have to do that. I've promoted women to the highest positions in my companies over the years and they have done an incredible job. I'm proud of our unbelievable movement, because that's what we have is a movement. Men and women who only want a better future for their children. That's what they want, that's what we want. <APPLAUSE> I know that if my father and my mother were alive today, they would be very, very proud of me and they'd be proud of everybody in this room and all of the other stadiums and all of the other rooms that we're in. We have the greatest people in the world. The greatest people. And we are going to make America great again. And it's going to happen fast too, I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> My parents knew what was in my heart. They would know the love that I have for all the hardworking people in this country and the love that I have for my country itself. I'm glad that I have the chance today to open my heart to all of you and tell you how much I want to make our country so much better, so much stronger, so much safer, so much wealthier. We have to do all of those things. A woman came up to me and said, Mr. Trump, please, sir, leave out wealthy; it doesn't sound good. I said, can I use rich instead? Rich. No, no, that doesn't sound good. I said, here's the problem, countries all over the world are ripping off the United States. They're taking our wealth, they're taking our jobs, they're taking our future. We have no choice. We want to save our Social Security and our Medicare and our Medicaid. We want to save our wealth. We want to keep our taxes as low as possible. Right now, they're far too high. Our taxes are going to be cut massively by me, if I get in. And Hillary's going to raise taxes. <APPLAUSE> Our regulations, which are killing our companies, are going to be cut massively by me. And I'll tell you what. You look at your energy companies, your natural gas, your coal companies, your steel companies, they can't do business, they can't compete with the rest of the world because the regulations are so horrible and so massive. So we're going to cut taxes. Hillary's going to raise taxes. We're going to cut taxes big league for the middle class, big league for business. We're going to grow again. Companies aren't going to be leaving our shores. They're not going to be leaving us for Mexico and other places. We're going to have companies coming back and new companies being formed. It's going to happen very quickly. <APPLAUSE> My whole life I've been a fighter, and now I'm going to fight for you. We're going to fight. <APPLAUSE> We're going to bring back our military. You know, our military needs enhancement. It's so depleted. We're going to fight for our veterans who are being horribly mistreated, not taken care of properly. In many cases, illegal immigrants are being taken care of much better than our veterans. <APPLAUSE> We're going to fight for our Second Amendment, which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> We're going to take care of that one easily. We're going to fight to have Supreme Court justices that believe in our Constitution appointed to the Supreme Court. <APPLAUSE> We're going to fight for all of our businesses, but we're going to fight for the steel businesses that have been taken away from us. We're going to fight from those -- for those miners whose jobs have been <inaudible>. You know, when I was in West Virginia, I met incredible people and a lot of miners. And I said to them, did you ever think of maybe moving to another area and going into another profession?
<AUDIENCE: Hell no!>
<TRUMP:> They said, Mr. Trump -- just like she goes, hell no. <LAUGHTER> But just like -- it's just like that. They say, Mr. Trump, we love being miners, we love mining. Our grandparents did it, our great parents -- grandparents did it, our fathers. We love mining. And I realized the love that they had for mining. And as you remember, weeks before Hillary Clinton made a statement someplace else before going to West Virginia and trying to get their vote, if you can believe this, she said we are going to close the mines and we're going to put the miners out of work. Then she went to West Virginia and she tried to convince them, well, she didn't mean it. Let me tell you, folks, we're going to take care of our mines, we're going to take care of our miners. We're going to have clean coal, clean coal, we're going to have them. But we're going to bring back our <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to protect a great new resource, something that really over the last fairly short period of time, from an energy standpoint, has become so important, and something so important to this area; natural gas. So we are going to keep our people working and we're going to have a lot more people working. We are going to get rid of Obamacare. We are going to get rid of Common Core. We're going to bring our education local. <APPLAUSE> We are going to make great and lasting trade deals, not the horrible trade deals. This year on trade, we will have almost an $800 billion trade deficit. Think of it. Who negotiates these deals? Who's negotiating? In other words, countrywide. With China, we're going to lose almost $500 billion. But think of this, countrywide we do all this work. We're going to have a trade deficit of $800 almost billion. It's not going to happen anymore, folks. It's not going to happen anymore. <APPLAUSE> We're going to trade -- we're going to trade, but I say we're going to now have a two-lane. You now, we have a one -- we have a one-lane superhighway going into Mexico, right? You know that. Hello.
<AUDIENCE: Hi!>
<TRUMP:> We have a one-lane highway going into Mexico. We're going to make it maybe for a little while, to get some of it back, a one-lane highway coming back. But ultimately, it's going to be like this. We want to be fair. We're going to bring Pennsylvania steel and manufacturing back. We're going to unleash trillions in new energy, and we're going to put our miners back to work. We're going to protect our hunters and save our Second Amendment. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton wants to do big, big damage, big, big damage to the Second Amendment. We're going to fix your schools and your inner cities and reduce crime and poverty and joblessness. And we're going to liberate millions of African-Americans and Hispanic Americans from poverty. What they're going through is unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make Pennsylvania and Ohio, and so many other places within our country, the manufacturing hub of the world once again. We're going to be able to do it. It's going to be not even hard to do. But to do these things, we must push aside the politicians and the special interests who have betrayed us. They've betrayed us. So this year, we have an election coming up on November 8th. So important that you get out and vote. So important that you watch other communities, because we don't want this election stolen from us. We don't want this election stolen from us. We do not want this election stolen. We have a movement like they've never seen before. Bill O'Reilly and others have said this is the single greatest phenomena they've ever seen. We have a movement like no other. We're going to make that movement incredible. And what we're going to end up with is this: a country that's not divided, a country that loves itself and loves its people. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make a country where people are proud to come in, people are proud to come through the borders, people want to come through because they respect us and they respect our values. We are going to make a country that's wealthy again. We're going to make a country that's safe again. We're going to make a country that know what it's doing and -- and functions on common sense again -- functions on common sense. <APPLAUSE> Our future is in our hands. On November 8th, you're going to look back and you're going to say I believe, years from now, that was the most important day and the most important vote that you have ever cast because we're going to turn our country around, we're going to take back our country, we're going to take back the White House. <APPLAUSE> We are going to work so hard and we are going to make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-10"">
<TRUMP:> Wow. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much, everybody. I don't know how old this building is, but I know one thing, we broke the building's record for attendance, OK? <APPLAUSE> And it's pretty good <AUDIO GAP> thousands of people outside and they are pulling in right now, so should we wait about an hour or not?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> No way, right? Let's start. They'll fill in as we -- as we speak. So I want to thank you -- I want to thank all of the great people of Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania. <APPLAUSE> They've taken our jobs out of Pennsylvania. We're going to be bringing them back, folks, believe me. <APPLAUSE> We're bringing them back. Oh, what these politicians have done to us, not going to happen much longer, I assume you saw the debate last night, everybody was good. <APPLAUSE> Better believe me. <APPLAUSE> So a special group, I don't know if you know who I am talking about, but they have been -- I don't know what it is. Bikers love Trump -- bikers, right? Bikers. <APPLAUSE> I don't know what it is. I'm riding in these cars and they're passing me, going about 150 miles an hour say, man, those guys have guts, but they are crazy, right? <APPLAUSE> But, you know, they had bikes for Trump, and it said, ""the deplorable run for Trump."" Who's in here from the deplorable run? <APPLAUSE> Yes, there are a lot of them, over 1,000 -- so there are over 1,000 and the bikers is special, and I'll tell you it's great to have them on my side. You know, a lot of times I'll go to an event. I did in Hilton Head and I did in a few places -- actually many places -- and I'll see hundreds of bikers on these beautiful bikes, oftentimes Harleys, I have to say oftentimes, but not always, not always. <APPLAUSE> But I'll see these bikers, and they'll be there, and I always feel so safe with the bikers. They are there, and a lot of times, they don't even want to come inside, they just want to make sure I'm safe. Can you believe that? They are great people. <APPLAUSE> They are great people. So, to the bikers, I -- I love you guys. You're great guys, right? Great guys. Also, I want to introduce, if I could, two people that have been unbelievable. They're Congressmen -- hard to believe, I mean, Congressmen. Who likes Congressmen? But I like these two congressmen. And we have Congressman Barletta. Where is he? Where is he? <APPLAUSE> Where is he? Come here. Congressman Marino, where is he? <APPLAUSE> Come here, and get up here. Senator Sessions and Rudy, get up here please. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make Pennsylvania so rich again, your jobs are coming back. <APPLAUSE> We're going to be ending illegal immigration. <APPLAUSE> We're going to stop the jobs from pouring out of our country. <APPLAUSE> We're going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals. These are deals made by people that don't have a clue. We're going to lower your taxes, big league. Hillary wants to increase your taxes by a lot. <BOOING> We're going to reduce regulations, which are killing your companies and they're leaving and they're going to Mexico and lots of other places for lots of reasons, but one of the reasons is a bad reason. It's called ""regulations."" They are regulating these companies out of existence, and jobs out of existence. We are going to unleash American energy, including oil... <APPLAUSE> ... shale, clean coal and natural gas. <APPLAUSE> Now, this just came out, this just came out. WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks. <APPLAUSE> And I said, write a couple of them down. Let's see. During a speech, look at Hillary Clinton, oh, she's crooked, folks. She's crooked as a three-dollar bill. <APPLAUSE> OK. Here's one. It just came out, ""Lock her up is right."" No. <APPLAUSE> So everybody saw the debate last night, so let me tell you. When I said we are going to get a special prosecutor to figure this deal out... <APPLAUSE> I have never been so ashamed of this country as what's gone on with Hillary Clinton. I have never seen anything like it. I have never ever seen anything like it. You have never seen anything like it. Thirty-three thousand e-mails -- thirty-three thousand, she deletes them, she bleaches them -- that nobody does because it's such an expensive process. She gets a subpoena from the United States Congress, and after she gets the subpoena, she does that, but we'll talk about that in a minute. We have to go back to WikiLeaks, so WikiLeaks. <APPLAUSE> So, a speech made behind closed doors, crooked Hillary Clinton said that terrorism was not a threat, quote, ""not a threat to the nation."" No. Let me tell you. <BOOING> Well, big, big, big threat. Terrorism was not a threat. Let me tell you, terrorism is a big threat. We're riding into something that's very dangerous and she's allowing thousands and thousands of people to come into this country, and I will tell you something, it's the great Trojan Horse, and we don't want to be part of the era -- well, we have the great -- well, they're talking about us in 200 years from now, OK, as the stupid people that got taken. Then over here, let's see, and bragged about her great relationship with the financial industry. That's where she gets all the money. In Florida, they say she's going to put ads on 50 to one, and I think we're going to win. I think we're going to win. <APPLAUSE> Hillary admitted -- oh, this is a beauty -- during one of the secret speeches, amazing how nothing is secret today when you talk about the Internet, no. <LAUGHTER> Hillary admitted that ISIS could infiltrate with the refugees, great. Then why is she letting so many people into our country. <BOOING> She said Wall Street can police itself. All right, that's -- who cares. Big bank, Clinton said, needed Wall Street money in order to successfully -- she needs -- says here, quote, ""needs Wall Street money in order to successfully run a campaign,"" OK. So what else is new? You know, I said to her yesterday, I said, listen, I'm going to have over $100 million in my campaign, right? So meaning, I don't have to take money from all these characters that want everything because that's what's happening. So, she's out there and she got a lot of money. She made $200 million -- $250 million while she's in office, OK? Figure that one out, figure that one out. <BOOING> So I said, so look, I'm putting up $100 million -- it's going to end up being more than that -- but I'm putting up all this money and I'm also getting tremendous amounts of money from people like $61 a piece, a record set. No Republican has ever done that, no Republican. <APPLAUSE> Which tells me that we have a great movement going on, right? That's what a great movement is. But I said to Hillary Clinton, why did you put up $10 million or $20 million, $25 million, put up some of the money that you ripped off when you're a secretary of State, when you're in the Senate. Figure it. From the time they left the White House until now, $250 million. I said, put some of the money into your campaign. Don't get it from these companies that all want favors. So let's see what happens with that, so let's see. Speech behind closed doors, Hillary said, ""In order to be successful politically,"" this is a bad one, ""you need to have both a public and private position on public policy. <BOOING> In other words, we have to tell you one thing and we have to tell the bankers is another thing, that's good. Another closed door speech, she's got a lot of money, she wanted to have open borders. <BOOING> And open trade -- trade with anybody. There go the rest of your jobs. Your jobs are 40 percent gone now anyway, there go the rest of your jobs. She wants -- in one of the other speeches, universal health care coverage, single parent system. She wanted to be like Canada, but the people in Canada with money, when they have an operation, they come down to this country because they have got a lot of problems up in Canada, so she wants to go. Forget it. Here's an interesting one. Sidney Blumenthal... <BOOING> Do you remember what Ambassador Stevens in Benghazi was calling, and writing, and even -- they were desperate for help. They say like 600 times, right? The only one she was speaking to is Sidney Blumenthal who's a sleaze -- he's a sleaze. In fact, Obama wanted her restricted that she couldn't speak. That's probably one of the reasons she wanted to have her private server, you know, she wanted to go -- because she promised Obama that she wouldn't be talking to sleazy Sidney. So, Blumenthal writes a quote -- this just came out a little while ago, I have to tell you this. One important point has been universally acknowledged by the nine previous reports about Benghazi. This is Sidney Blumenthal, the only one she was talking to. She wasn't talking to Ambassador Stevens, even the 600 calls, probably desperation. The attack was almost certainly preventable, Benghazi. Clinton was in-charge of the State Department and it failed to protect the United States personnel and an American consulate in Libya, he meant Benghazi. If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate. In other words, she is now admitting that they could have done something about Benghazi. This just came out a little while ago. <BOOING> What a group we have, what a group. <APPLAUSE> What a group we have. So, we're going to do a lot. We're working very hard, we have 28 days, November 8th is the big day. We're going to get out, we're going to win. I'm going to make three, four, five stops a day. I may be limping across that finish line, but we're going to get across that finish line. <APPLAUSE> And I figure -- I figure that that final week maybe we do six stops a day and we'll call them ""Get Out The Vote Stops."" If you don't mind, we'll make them a lot shorter than what we're doing. Just get out, because we got to get you out to vote. And honestly, folks, you know, I went to school in Philadelphia, and I love Philadelphia. <APPLAUSE> I love Philadelphia, and I hope we're going to do great in Philadelphia. I went to school there, I love the school, I loved everything. But, I just hear such reports about Philadelphia, and we have to make sure we're protected, we have to make sure the people of Philadelphia protected, that the vote counts are 100 percent, everybody wants that. But, I hear these horror shows -- I hear these horror shows, and we have to make sure that this election is not stolen from us and is not taken away from us. <APPLAUSE> And everybody knows what I'm talking about, and this crooked media --you can talk about crooked Hillary -- they're worse than she is. <BOOING> I'm telling you, they are so dishonest. Without the media -- without the media, Hillary Clinton couldn't be elected dog catcher, I mean that, it's true, true. <APPLAUSE> Rudy knows I only tell the truth, I only tell the truth. You know, they do focus groups after the debate. We won every poll. We won. Did you see those polls? Every poll, 80-20, 90-10 -- I get a list, but we don't want to put -- but every poll. But CNN did a focus group. <BOOING> And by the way, Frank Luntz did a focus group, and the focus group -- that one we liked -- Frank Luntz, good guy, 18 to four in favor of Trump, right? <APPLAUSE> CNN did a focus group. Unfortunately -- it's so sad. They got caught trying to convince people and find the right people so they could give a phony vote. CNN is a disgrace -- disgrace. <BOOING> They just turned off their camera. <APPLAUSE> So funny, they just turned off their camera. I love it. <APPLAUSE> I love it now these dishonest people. They're dishonest. But, you know, when you look at them and, in fact, if somebody get me -- get me -- get me a list. Where is the great Dan Scavino? Get me a list. I'll tell you about the list. Bring it up here right away, bring it up here, I'll tell you. But we had a good time last night, and they just sent out -- they had 69 million people watching, which is just about, they say, the most ever to watch the second debate, which is fantastic. <APPLAUSE> Which is fantastic. And even the bad media admitted, you know, when I say, the line in the sand, and she said, I wasn't secretary of State. Unfortunately, she was, she lied, again she lied. Hillary lied, but it wasn't as big a lie as the e-mails, don't you agree? No, no, no, she lied, she's a liar. <APPLAUSE> And she lied -- and she lied when she said that she didn't say that TPP -- Trans-Pacific Partnership -- was the gold standard, right? She lied because she endorsed it, she wanted it 100 percent, then she heard me speaking about it and say they don't control monetary manipulation in all the ways that this country has taken advantage of, and she went against it temporarily. But, if she ever won, she'll approve that so fast, and nothing is as bad as NAFTA, but you know what, that's going to be close, it's going to be a disaster -- it's going to be a disaster, and so, she lied. She said, I never said it was the gold standard, unfortunately, it was the gold standard, so one of those things, one of those things. So, folks, it's so important that we get out in November, that we vote, so we get rid of these liars, we get rid of these incompetent people, we get rid of the Hillary Clintons of the world. <APPLAUSE> And you know, I'm with the Congressman and we're backstage, and a poll came out like we're down three points in the states of Pennsylvania, and they're going -- and these guys are pros. You may not like them because they are politicians, but I like them anyway despite they're being a politician. But, you know, they said, we can't believe it because everybody in Pennsylvania wants Trump, you know, and... <APPLAUSE> ... and we get crowds like this everywhere, but we get them in Ohio, we get them in Florida, we're doing -- we have one in Florida coming up 25,000 minimum -- minimum, two days, but we're getting them. But, they just said -- they said, there's no way we're three down. Even the polls are crooked, I'm telling you. Look, we're in a rig system, folks, we're in a rig system. The only way we can unrig them is get to the polls, but we got to make sure they're honest polls, we got to make sure. But, I think November 8th is going to be Brexit, but I... <APPLAUSE> ... you know, when I -- when I have a lot of property over there, so they ask me about Brexit, and I said, well, I think it's going to pass, meaning they wanted independence. The U.K. wanted to get out, they didn't want people pouring in to their country who nobody knew where they came from, right? So I said, no, I think it's going to pass. Huge headlines ""Trump says it's going to pass."" Remember Obama went over there, he said he's going to put them on the back of the line and it's never going to pass, and if it does, they're going to put them in the back of the line. I think he helped it pass, you want to know the truth? So, they said it's going to pass, and I said it's going to pass, but it was given very, very little chance of passage, very, very little chance. And then what happened is it passed easily, right? So the polls were all really wrong, but big league wrong. We're just a little tiny bit behind here, and the polls were just like unbelievable. So, it passed and nobody said, Trump said it was going to happen. I hate that, you know, I hate that. But what is going to happen, I think the state of Pennsylvania, we're going to win so big. I'm just thinking -- I think we're going to win in Pennsylvania. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to spend a lot of time in the suburbs over the next couple of weeks, the suburbs of Philadelphia because we got to get that vote, we want to get that vote. I know you're gonna vote, right? Right? <APPLAUSE> So we're going to get that vote and we'll get it fast. Where are those polls? Bring them up here. Dan Scavino, everybody, the famous Dan Scavino. <APPLAUSE> Let me see. Did anybody ever hear of Dan? He's become quite famous in social media. All right, you ready? So it says here, in -- ah, Drudge is a great guy, right? Right. <APPLAUSE> What a great man. Trump 70, Clinton 30, this is the list. <APPLAUSE> Variety, you know, that's the show business people, but they're not going to like this. These people don't like Trump, you know, the showbiz. Trump 64. See, this guy doesn't stop, look at this guy. Trump 64, Clinton 36. <APPLAUSE> Listen to this. Time Magazine -- now do you think Time Magazine likes me even though I've been on their cover like seven or eight times? They're liking us. Time Magazine, no fan of Trump, 89 to 11. <APPLAUSE> Fox -- Fox, 85 to 13, where are the other couple of points? <APPLAUSE> Here's a good one -- well. they're are the slightly conservative -- Breitbart, 93 to seven, would you say that? <APPLAUSE> Fox Seattle, 79 to 16. <APPLAUSE> Detroit, 84 to 16. Get the hell out of here, Dan.
<SCAVINO: See ya. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> So, we're going to have -- is there any more fun to be than a Trump rally in all fairness, right? <APPLAUSE> So here's what I'm going to tell you. You know, I spend a lot of time with Senator Sessions who's the king of the borders. He is the king, one of the great men, one of the most highly respected men in the United States Senate, and they go to him -- and I remember Ted Cruz, who endorsed me recently, which was very nice -- but, I remember Ted Cruz has such respect for Senator Sessions. And one of the reasons is nobody knows more about the border than Senator Sessions, and we were talking a little while ago and we have people coming in and we just got ICE two days ago -- ICE. These are great people, by the way, they're not allowed to do their job, but they're great people. They just endorsed me because they want to do their job. <APPLAUSE> The Border Patrol, the Border Patrol just endorsed me -- the Border Patrol just endorsed me. And I will tell you such an honor, 16,500 Border Patrol agents, they endorsed Trump, first time they've ever done it. And then very importantly, Sheriff Joe from Arizona, we love Joe. <APPLAUSE> And I told New Hampshire, which has a tremendous problem with heroin and other places, but, New Hampshire was the first state I went and then we went in to run like people haven't seen very easily. But I told New Hampshire very, very strongly, I told New Hampshire, if I win, we're going to solve the problem of this poison flowing into Pennsylvania... <APPLAUSE> ... to New York, to New England, to all of these different places, to Ohio -- where they have a big problem -- to Florida, we're going to stop the poison -- and to do that, we're going to build a wall. <APPLAUSE> Who is going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> Who?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> They don't know it yet, but they're paying for the wall, right? They don't know. <APPLAUSE> No, they're great. I was with a few of our friends, we went to Mexico two months ago, we had a great meeting with the president and he's a good guy, and we're working that everybody is going to be happy. But, right now, it's a very unfair highway going in. It's a highway going in and there's no highway going out, our jobs, our money, our wealth is going there. A friend of mine who builds plants, he's the biggest. He builds plants, that's what he does. If you said build an apartment, maybe he wouldn't do so well, but he builds the best plants in the world -- biggest and the best. And I said, how are you doing? And you might have heard me say this, I think it's incredible and, frankly, it's terrible in a certain way. He said, Donald, I'm doing great, the business is great. I said, good. How is it in the United States? Not very good. Where is it good? He said, Mexico. He said it's the seventh wonder of the world. He said, it's the most incredible thing you've ever seen. We are building some of the biggest, most sophisticated plants in the world. Now, the people are coming out of Michigan, Ford announced -- as you know -- Ford just announced that they're moving their entire building of small cars to Mexico. <BOOING> Out of Mexico. That's on top of a $2.5 billion plant that they built three years ago, that I've been complaining about for three years, and that's why I think we're going to win in the state of Michigan, because I've been complaining about this for years, and these other guys like Hillary, she started complaining in about two -- two days ago. She's not going to do anything. So, we're going to create strong borders, and we're not going to let our businesses go. And when Ford says, we're leaving, or when Carrier Air-conditioning says they're leaving the great state of Indiana where we have a wonderful, wonderful vice presidential nominee. <APPLAUSE> Mike Pence, great friend. A great guy and, by the way, a totally loyal person. This guy, he called me up, do you mind if I put out a statement? No, what -- what would you like to put out -- just, absolutely put it out Mike. This guy is so loyal, so good and such a terrific person, and his family, Karen, his wife, and family is amazing. He was one of our really good choices. Do you agree with that? One of our really good choices. <APPLAUSE> And he's done a great job in Indiana, AAA rating, lower the taxes, done really a good job unlike this guy, Tim Kaine. <BOOING> You know, in his first week as governor of Virginia, he signed a $4 billion tax increase, this is what you have, and Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes -- but he signed a $4 billion tax increase -- so here's what's going to happen, folks. When these companies like Carrier Air-conditioning think they're going to leave Indiana or leave Pennsylvania, or leave Ohio or leave any of your states, they can go between states, I can't get involved, OK, if you don't mind. You gotta -- that's up to you and your governor and all of the people. But, if they think they're going to go out and they're going to make air-conditioners, move to Mexico, build their new plant and sell those air-conditioners, now through a very strong powerful border and they're going to sell those air-conditioners and they've let 1,400 people go in Indianapolis, not going to happen that way -- not going to happen. There will be consequences, they will pay a 35 percent tax on every air-conditioner that comes across the border. <APPLAUSE> And when they know that, they won't leave Indiana and these companies won't leave Pennsylvania, and they're not there because their numbers don't work anymore, OK? We're going to stop them so easily. And I've been watching these politicians go through this for years. I've been watching them give low interest loans, I've been watching them give zero interest loans -- these companies don't even need the money, most of them, they take the money. There were a couple of instances where geniuses with great lawyers gave them money and then they moved anyway because they didn't have any restrictive confidence in the -- I mean, the whole thing is crazy. But, what's going to happen is once they find out, they're not going to leave. OK? They're not going to leave so, we're going to have strong borders. We're going to have a wall, the wall is going to stop people from coming into our country illegally... <APPLAUSE> ... along with Border Patrol and ICE. The wall is going to stop poison drugs, poison from ruining our youth and poisoning our youth and other people. <APPLAUSE> And, you know, I have something I always like doing, I read this when I'm in a good mood -- I'm in such a great mood. You know, I wish those cameras would show this crowd because if they would, people would be amazed, they never show the crowd. <APPLAUSE> They never show the crowd, show the crowd, see they don't want to turn around. <APPLAUSE> Look at the cameras they face straight. They face -- my wife is always going, how was the crowd? She said, it sounded big, but I never see it. They never show the crowd because you know what, they don't want us to win and they don't show these crowds, but you look at these crowds, Bernie Sanders never even came close, and he was second, by the way. Hey fellas, turn the cameras around, seriously way up there in the upper decks, show the crowds. <APPLAUSE> But they just don't want to do it. They keep that camera pinned to my face, they don't even want to show what's behind me, they keep that camera pinned to my face.
<AUDIENCE: (OFF-MIKE)>
<TRUMP:> They are so dishonest.
<AUDIENCE: CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!>
<TRUMP:> You know, if crooked Hillary Clinton were up here and they had this kind of a crowd, the cameras would be showing the crowd all day long. <APPLAUSE> That's why we have to win this election, we have to take it away from these dishonest characters. So here's the story, folks, it's true, every night I go home, my wife said, how big was the crowd? She said, it sounded huge. I said, yes, they have like what, 16,000 people. So she said, yes, it sounded that. I said, didn't you see it? No, they never showed the crowd. It's always my face -- my face, I don't want to -- I don't want to show my face, I want the crowd, but they never moved the camera. You know, I used to think they couldn't. I figured their brand new equipment they couldn't because mechanically they didn't moved. And then when they're -- but unfortunately, when we had a protester the first time, right, you know what I'm going to say, those cameras they turned like a pretzel, the steel wow, wow. <APPLAUSE> So, they look like pretzels. I never -- I never knew that steel could be bent in that kind of a configure. <LAUGHTER> They're dishonest. But because of the fact that we have lots of problems, but one of the problems we have a tremendous illegal immigration problem. And now Hillary Clinton wants people to come in from Syria at a rate -- think of this... <BOOING> They're coming to your community, folks, at a rate of 550 percent more than Obama and he's letting them in by the thousands, and we have no idea who the hell they are. So, I have this -- has anyone heard ""The Snake"" because people love it, but... <APPLAUSE> OK. Who has -- who has not heard it? Who has heard it? <APPLAUSE> Shall we do it or not?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> It's so good. So, you think of this in terms of illegal immigration, in terms of people coming into our country that we have no idea who they are, and in terms of the fact that lots of bad things will happen. And again, before I start, I have a big heart, you have a big heart, we all have big hearts. We want to see good things happen, right? So we're going to build safe zones in Syria, we're going to have the Gulf States pay for it because we owe right now $20 trillion, it's double during Obama's term. And the bad part, it doubled though we didn't do anything, we didn't fix our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our airports are a mess, they're like third world. So, we have totally too much debt and we didn't fix anything. We got problems, folks, but we'll get it fixed if we get elected, otherwise, we're going down. So, this is a case for illegal immigration and it was written by Al Wilson, anybody ever heard of Al Wilson? And it wasn't meant for this, it was a song, but, I saw it once and I thought it was very apropos. So, this is thinking about illegal immigration, and what's going to happen as sure as you are -- sorry, we have no seats -- standing there. ""On a way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. Poor thing, she said, I'll take you in and I'll take care of you. Take me in, oh, tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman, sighed the broken snake. She wrapped them up all cozy in the comfort of silk, and laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night. And as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she taken in, had been revived. Take me in, oh, tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman, sighed the broken snake. She clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful, she cried, but if I hadn't brought you in by now, you surely might have died. She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying, thank you, the snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in, oh, tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman, sighed the vicious snake -- vicious, vicious, vicious. I saved you, cried the woman, and you've bit me heaven's why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die. Oh, shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin, you knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in."" <APPLAUSE> And then we have very incompetent politicians in Washington taking everybody in, that honestly it's a very sad thing to behold and to watch, very, very, very sad. Is there a doctor in the house? Are you OK? Thank you very much. Thank you. Are you OK? You know, we have people waiting here for seven, eight hours. I love you, darling. I love you. Look at her. <APPLAUSE> She's tougher than all of us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Look at that guy over there. <APPLAUSE> Wow. Wow.
<AUDIENCE: Bring him up! Bring him up! Bring him up!>
<TRUMP:> Bring him up. <APPLAUSE> What's your -- what's your name?
<UNKNOWN: Nate (ph). (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Now he's supposed to look like Donald Trump, but he's actually much too good-looking, you are really handsome. <APPLAUSE> Are you having a good time tonight?
<UNKNOWN: Not (ph).>
<TRUMP:> Where is your daddy and your mommy, right? Do you want to go back -- do you want to go back to them or do you want to stay with Donald Trump?
<UNKNOWN: Trump. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Beautiful, what a beautiful boy, what a beautiful boy. Thank you.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> I'll tell you what folks, we better win on November 8th. You know, one of these -- one of these pundits said to me -- because this is a movement, there's never been anything like this -- they say -- many of them said -- Bill O'Reilly said -- a lot of respect for Bill O'Reilly, tough guy, smart guy. <APPLAUSE> He said, it's the single greatest political phenomena he's seen in his lifetime, that covers a lot of territory. And others have said the same thing, and they said, really it doesn't matter if you win or if you lose, it doesn't matter because what -- I said, let me tell you a little secret. If we don't win, this is the greatest waste of time, energy and money that I will ever do in my life, believe me -- believe me. We're not doing this to come in second, folks. And if we come in second, your Second Amendment is in trouble because she wants to decimate it. <BOOING> And we're going to fix -- by the way, you know, we're going to do something that people haven't done. We're going to fix our inner cities, we're going to help our Latino-Americans and our African-Americans, we're going to help them. <APPLAUSE> Forty-five percent of African-American youth lives in poverty, fifty-eight percent of African-American youth don't have jobs. More than 3,000 people have been shot in the city of Chicago since the beginning of the year -- think of that -- since January 1st, 3,000, that means it's like a war zone. The Democrats, like crooked Hillary Clinton... <BOOING> ... have run the inner cities for 50, 60, 70, even 100 years uninterrupted. They produce only more joblessness, failing schools and rising crime. Those African-Americans suffering in our country -- and I have to tell you this -- they're suffering -- they're suffering. You got no jobs -- inner cities, you got no jobs, you have no safety, you have no education. The schools are horrible. I say to them, what the hell do you have to lose? I'm going to fix the inner cities, I'm going to fix them. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to fix them. Vote for Trump. We've spent $6 billion -- think of this, think of this -- we spent billions and billions of dollars on different things. We don't get our monies worth, but we've spent in the Middle East $5 to $6 trillion, what do we have? It's worse now, had we done nothing in the Middle East it's much better than it is now. You wouldn't have the migration. Look at the mistakes that Hillary Clinton made. Libya, Iraq, they created ISIS because the way they got out of Iraq, whether you like going into the war or not, and despite what you read from these dishonest people, I was against going into Iraq, by the way. But whether you were in or not, it was somewhat with the surge stabilized and they announced to the world that they're going to take everybody out real fast, get them out, get them out, get them out, and the vacuum was created. And guess who came out of the vacuum, who came out of the vacuum? ISIS. That was Hillary Clinton and our great genius President Barack Obama. <BOOING> And now what he does -- all he wants to do is campaign. Remember he said, Donald Trump will never win the Republican primary. All right, so we've won that one, right? Isn't it too bad -- isn't it too bad that we don't have stronger leadership on both sides -- on both sides. I mean, you know, you have people that can't fix a budget, but then they start talking about their nominee, but they can't fix the budget. Isn't it really sad that we don't have stronger leadership on both sides? But that'll change if we win on November 8th, believe me it's going to change fast -- going to change fast. <APPLAUSE> But why is it that the President of the United States, we've got no growth. You saw GNP, you saw that GDP, you saw that, right? It's so bad like one percent. That means we're not growing. Do you know if China goes down to seven or eight percent, it's like considered a national tragedy? Here we are hovering at nothing, our jobs are gone, we have bad jobs. They have a phony employment rate. Bad jobs numbers last week, did you see those bad jobs numbers? And that's the last jobs report before the election, I was shocked. I was so surprised that they let that happen because it's all rigged -- it's all rigged. But, let me just tell you, we're going to do something that's going to be so amazing. I'm going to fight harder than anybody has ever fought for the American people -- harder. <APPLAUSE> We're going to help the Latinos trapped in poverty. We're going to fight for school choice. We're going to fight to end common core, which we'll do very quickly and bring education locally. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary Clinton can't do those things because she's totally run by the Teachers Union, which are wonderful people, by the way, but they have total control so you can't choice and you can't end common core. If you're Hillary Clinton, you can't do it because you're controlled by the teachers just like she's controlled by Wall Street. So what we're going to do are things that haven't been done, and these things are going to be wonderful. We have a military that's depleted, we have to build up our military, we have to -- we have no choice. <APPLAUSE> We have to take care of our great veterans, we're not taking care of our veterans, not taking care of. <APPLAUSE> We're going to save your Second Amendment, we're going to terminate Obamacare and replace it. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have the largest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, remember this, hers are going up. We are going to do things that are going to make you so proud of this country again, you're going to be so proud. You're going to go to the polls and you're going to even home tonight and you're going to say to your husband, to your wife, to your children, to whoever listens, I had a great time, but you're going to look back in 10 years, in 15 and 20 years, and 25 years, and you're going to say, this was one of the most important nights -- more importantly, you're going to say, on November 8th, the single-most important vote you've ever cast, is going to be cast on November 8th. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Donald Trump! Donald Trump! Donald Trump! (APPLAUSE) USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> She wants to put our miners out of business. <BOOING> Not going to happen, going to be just the -- we're going to have clean coal. We're going to have all forms of energy, we're going to have all forms of energy. We're going to have everything, but we're going to take care of our minors, we're going to take care of our steelworkers. We're going to not let the EPA destroy our companies for natural gas, and shale and all other things, not going to let it happen. <APPLAUSE> We're not going to let it happen. So, you're going to go home and you're going to say, great evening, great evening, but you're going to look back at that vote and you're going to say, that was a very, very important day, that that was the greatest vote I've ever cast, because that's when our country started turning around -- that's when our country started turning around. <APPLAUSE> And you're going to be proud of your country again and, hopefully, you're going to be very proud of your president and you're going to see things happen that have never happened before. We're going to make great trade deals. We're going to have a strong military and, hopefully, we're not going to have to use it but it's called ""peace through strength."" <APPLAUSE> And we're going to have our borders back again, and people are going to come into our country, but they're going to come in legally. They aren't going to come in -- we're going to have a big beautiful door. <APPLAUSE> But, they're going to come in legally through a process, and it's not going to be a process now, where people are waiting in line for 10 years and they don't move and you had people come right across the border, so unfair. We're going to have a fair process and we want people to come in. Is that correct? We want people, but they have to come in legally. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to see immediate change, and that's what you need. Hillary Clinton is not about change, Hillary Clinton has been doing this stuff for 30 years. <BOOING> And I said to her last night -- I said to her last night, I said, you know, Hillary, you talk about this thing and that thing, and Donald's got some great tax deal, but all her friends have the same thing. All her friends, they said, Hillary, you are United States senator, why didn't you something about it? She's not going to do anything about anything, it's just talk. And you saw it and I said, when she was a senator, she said she was going to do things. She never did a thing, it only got worse. That's what's going to happen with our country, folks. So here's the story, you go out, early vote, do whatever you have to do, but you go out on November 8th and you vote, because so many things we are going to put -- remember this, people don't talk about it. Justice Scalia passed away. Great man, great justice. We are going to appoint great people who believe in our Constitution to the United States Supreme Court... <APPLAUSE> ... people that believes in our Second Amendment to the United States Supreme Court. <APPLAUSE> This election day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country. You have 29 days -- can you believe it? This started on June 16th of last year, coming down the escalator, to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country to come true. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C., will come face-to-face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, it's about time. <APPLAUSE> We are going to smash the Washington establishment and open it up to each and every American the way it's supposed to be. <APPLAUSE> Wouldn't it be nice if some of our politicians fought the special interest instead of fighting me and you? <APPLAUSE> The sad truth is a lot of establishment politicians simply don't believe in protecting our borders, or fixing our trade deals, or putting America first, and we are going to put America first. <APPLAUSE> I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background from every stretch of this nation, and I'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. We are a divided country now. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, you're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before and you will never see it again, if it doesn't happen on November 8th, it's never going to happen for our country. Believe me, it will never happen again. We are going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election and say, this is by far, and I say it again and again, the most important vote -- by far -- that you've ever cast. We're going to vote to make our country safe again. <APPLAUSE> We're going to vote to make our country wealthy again. <APPLAUSE> We are going to vote on November 8th to make our country great again. Thank you very much. God bless you. I love you. Thank you, thank you. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-11"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> Hey, fellas, can we move over a little bit? Fellas? Fellas? Fellas? Hey, can we move over a little bit, please, could we? We need room. Come on. Thank you. Could you move over, please? We want the people to be able to see. We all love each other. <APPLAUSE> We want room, right? <APPLAUSE> Well, it's great to be in Florida. My second home, I live here, I stay here, I love this place. And I want to tell you, so I guess we have, like, 11,200 here and outside we have over 10,000 people. Would anybody like to switch places? <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> You are great! There is no place like being at a Trump rally. No place. No place. <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much. In 28 days we're going to win Florida and we are going to win back the White House. We're going to win them back. <APPLAUSE> I'd like to begin tonight by extending our thoughts and prayers to those recovering from the tragic aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. And I watched and fortunately it took a little bit of a turn to the right, to the east, and we got a little lucky, but it was still very bad. So to everybody, our thoughts and prayers are with you. Thank you. Due to the hurricane, voter registration it's been extended. Did you hear about this? Through tomorrow, so register, you've got to go and register or we've really -- you know, we're doing something that's incredible, it's a movement. But if we don't win, all it is is a little asterisk in history. There's never been anything like this. So go and register, make sure you get out and vote November 28th <sic>. If you've already registered, request an absentee ballot today and vote really early. We've got to win. The Hillary Clinton documents released today by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election, so much corruption. This election will determine whether we remain a free country in the truest sense of the word or we become a corrupt banana republic controlled by large donors and foreign governments. The election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country, believe me. It will lead to the destruction of our country. Today we learned amazingly that the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. What is going on? <BOOING> Rudy Giuliani said it. This is collusion and corruption of the highest order and is one more reason why I ask my attorney general, I will ask, to appoint a special prosecutor. <APPLAUSE> We have to investigate Hillary Clinton and we have to investigate the investigation. This was a disgrace. This was a disgrace. Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after congressional subpoenas. Can you imagine that? They got a subpoena from the United States Congress and then they deleted everything. If you did that in private life, you go to jail. And then destroyed her phones, some with a hammer, boom. Anybody destroy your phones before with a hammer, anybody? No? Anybody? No? And people have gone to jail for doing far less. She also lost, think of this, she was secretary of state, lost as much as $6 billion in taxpayer money while she was running secretary of state. Now, some people say it was misplaced. Oh, billions of dollars misplaced. These WikiLeaks e-mails confirm what those of us here today have known all along. Hillary Clinton is the vessel, a corrupt global establishment that's raiding our country and surrendering the sovereignty of our nation. This criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration and rule by corporations. It also believes in no borders, just come on, folks, come on in. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, again just revealed, Hillary Clinton said my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders. Well, there go the rest of your businesses and there goes your country, folks. <BOOING> She doesn't say that. Behind closed doors when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America, no borders. You don't have borders, we don't have a country. WikiLeaks has given us a window into the secret corridors of government power where we see a former secretary of state announcing her desire to end forever the American independence that our Founders gave to us and wanted us to have. American soldiers has fought and died to win and keep America's freedom, and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to these open borders, open trade and a world government. And by the way, we want a government for the United States. We're very happy with it. We're very happy with it. <APPLAUSE> Crooked Hillary is so radical on immigration that as secretary of state she refused to make foreign countries take back their criminal aliens. We have them all over the place. She didn't want to bring them back. Bring them back -- the countries were smart, they say we don't want them. We say, OK, we'll take them. And then you look at the crime and you wonder why. And by the way, do you know, it was just announced, that murder is the highest it's been in our country in 45 years. You've heard that, right? One such killer who was set free on Hillary's watch went to a jail, came out and went on to kill a beautiful young American girl named Casey Chadwick. People have heard that name, beautiful, wonderful person. The killer, who had already been convicted for shooting a girl in the head, should have been sent home. Instead, he was set free and stabbed Casey in the face and neck 15 times violently and stuffed her body in a closet. The corrupt establishment in Washington wants to surrender America's borders, even as they send our troops overseas to protect the borders of foreign countries. We are protecting the borders of foreign countries, but not our borders. A Trump administration will secure control, defend and protect the borders of the United States. We are going to protect. <APPLAUSE> And the Border Patrol agents just gave us, as you know, their endorsement, never did it before. ICE just gave us their endorsement. Sheriff Joe from Arizona just gave us his endorsement. <APPLAUSE> Even Chelsea Clinton, the WikiLeaks e-mails show, expressed serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti. The Haitian community has contributed so much to this country and to this state. I also learned from them firsthand how much they despise the Clintons for what they did to the people of Haiti. New e-mails revealed today by ABC News show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people at least, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of Bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment. People who were labeled not friends of Bill were placed very much on the sidelines. In their biggest project, the Clintons used $400 million in aid and U.S. taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a massive sweatshop. And guess who set it up? Cheryl Mills, Hillary's chief of staff who helped destroy her e-mails, and then got immunity from the FBI that included the destruction of her computer. <BOOING> Never been anything -- folks, there's never been anything like this. There's never been what's gone on here with the e-mail destruction, with the deletion of thousands and thousands. And last week it was revealed that two boxes of e-mails and information were missing. They were missing, they're gone. The company that benefited from Mills's actions then invent a company that put a lot of money in a company owned by Cheryl Mills. They invested. Today, Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise. We should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time out. To all of our friends in Haiti and to all of our friends in Little Haiti who are so amazing, your day of justice is coming. And it arrives on November 8th. We've got to do this. Gotta do it. We've got to do it. <APPLAUSE> Not only have the Clintons ripped off Haiti, but the new e-mails show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholics. While this is offensive, it's just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign has really for everyday Americans. And you see it and you see so much from these WikiLeaks. You see so much, there's so much. We've all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement, you've seen it, how disrespectful she is to the Secret Service and many others in uniform even there to protect her. And by the way, these are weapon-carrying people. They carry weapons. Hillary Clinton wants to really dismantle our Second Amendment, you know? So maybe she should start with her security people not carrying weapons. Does that make sense to you? Maybe. Maybe she should. <APPLAUSE> She even smeared all of America's police officers as essentially racist. You heard that recently, essentially racist. And by the way, I want to give a shout out and salute to our great people of law enforcement, our police have done an amazing job. <APPLAUSE> I'm proud of the fact that I've always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel. These are amazing people. The WikiLeaks e-mails show that Hillary's staff even has given up secret notes on when she needs to smile. It's all a phony deal with her. By the way, did everybody see the debate, right? <APPLAUSE> Gotten good reviews, good reviews. We've gotten good reviews. We'll see what happens. But Pat Buchanan said the greatest of any presidential debate, the greatest performance. Thank you very much, folks. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> And we had eight online polls and every one of those, that's Time magazine and Drudge and so many others, and every one of them said we won by a massive margin. So let's hope it all boils down to winning on November 8th. Otherwise, honestly, I've wasted my time, you've wasted your time. I will have spent over $100 million on running for office. That's a lot of money, a lot of money. That's not the thing. If I don't win, it will be the single-greatest waste of time, energy and money. And, you know, somebody told me recently, a pundit said it doesn't matter whether you win or lose. What we've done, all of us, what we've done, but what I've done, has never been duplicated, there's never been anything like this in American history. You look at our crowds. I mean, Bernie Sanders was second, his crowds are tiny. Did you see Hillary Clinton today? She had this little crowd and they say, oh, it was the biggest crowd. She had nothing! She had nothing! <APPLAUSE> And they're talking on television because the media's rigged. Let me tell you... <APPLAUSE> ... the best thing she's got going, in my opinion the only thing she's got going, is the rigged media. She's got nothing going. Can you imagine working with her for four more years? The last thing we need, the last thing we need is another four years of Barack Obama. We don't need that, believe me. <BOOING> That's what we're going to get if we get her. But the e-mails also show yet again that the DNC, Democratic National Committee, rigged the Democratic election, the primary process, to take it away from Bernie and give it to Hillary Clinton. The DNC vice chair was caught feeding information about Bernie Sanders's plans to the Clinton campaign. You're not supposed to do that. It's supposed to be -- you know, if I was Bernie I wouldn't be too happy after watching what came out today on WikiLeaks. Bernie was used. And in all fairness, Bernie made a deal with the devil and he made a big mistake. He could have gone down as something very important in American history. When he made that deal, he sold out, he sold out, and very, very bad. But to all the Bernie voters out there, don't vote for a Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton. And remember this, the one thing I had in mind and the one thing we had in common with crooked Hillary was borders. The borders are much stronger, that's why I have all the endorsements from everybody on the borders. But Bernie knew that we were getting ripped off on trade and he was right, except my numbers are much different. We're going to redo it. We're going to have unbelievable trade deals. We're going to make unbelievable deals. But to the Bernie Sanders people, you got sold out. But remember this, I'm much stronger on trade, so much stronger on trade than Bernie. And trade was a big deal because he was right, we are getting sold out. Our jobs are being lost, our jobs are being taken, we're being sold out. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions, more Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals. And as confirmed just today by WikiLeaks, Hillary also wants to cute Medicare and Social Security. She wants to do that. <BOOING> A vote for Trump is a vote for America first and it's a vote to protect Medicare and Social Security. Believe me, we're going to protect our Medicare. We're going to protect our Social Security. She's not going to do it. <APPLAUSE> She's also going to raise your taxes big league, folks, and we're going to lower your taxes. Minor, minor thing, but just remember it. WikiLeaks also shows something I've been warning everybody -- everybody -- about for a long time. The media is simply an extension of Hillary Clinton's campaign. It's just one more way that the system is rigged, a big way, really a big way. Reporters who work for these outlets, like The Washington Post or The New York Times, may think of themselves as journalists, but they're actually just cogs in a corporate political machine. The dishonesty of The New York Times is unbelievable. The dishonest of The Washington Post is unbelievable. The dishonesty of all of those cameras, so many of them, not all of them, is unbelievable. <BOOING> The e-mails show The New York Times, the Boston Globe, Univision, a third-rate reporter named John Harwood, what a third-rate reporter that one is, remember he did the debate and made a total fool of himself, he's with CNBC, all doing favors for the Clintons. And reporters smothering the Clintons with praise. Why? Why? You saw Hillary on the debate stage. Do you think that's really worthy? Do you really think that's worthy, folks? Do you think that's what this country is all about? <BOOING> The New York Times even gave Clinton veto power over her quotes in a major story. I've never heard about that. I'd like to have veto power when they misquote me all the time. It's actually corruption. The e-mails also show that Hillary was given the CNN town hall questions before her big debate against Bernie Sanders. Is that possible? Donna Brazile, the DNC vice chair, e-mailed, ""From time to time I get questions in advance,"" she said. Oh, that's fair. Do you think that's fair to Bernie?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> I'm starting to feel, really, aren't we starting to feel sorry for Bernie Sanders, like, a little bit, right? The media can't report on the establishment because the media largely is the establishment. And the corrupt media is teamed up against you, the American people. And I used to get great press until I said I'm running. And then they said he's running, we don't want him to run. But I used to get great -- who got better press than me? I got great press, a lot of press. My wife said the other day you used to get such great press, now every single story is a slant. And I'll tell you what, it's libelous, it's slanderous, it's horrible and it's really unfair. But we're going to beat the system, we're going to beat the system. <APPLAUSE> We're going to break up the failed establishment, end the chronic corruption and create a new and bright American future. I didn't need to do this. Folks, I didn't need to do this, but we have to do it. And we have the greatest people on earth. The people of our country, these are the greatest people on earth. I've gotten to know so many. Our veterans are so incredible, they're not being taken care of. Our military, our police, we have the greatest people on earth. Hillary Clinton, the candidate of the past, today dredged up Al Gore. Did you see him? Anybody see him? <BOOING> Didn't he say he was the founder of the internet? He wasn't. To campaign with her in Florida. Al Gore wants to eliminate the combustion engine, essentially, and flies around the world on jets and pushes plans that would help create China, make it stronger. They make so much of our product, they make so much. They make so many of our big windmills. And, you know, when they're making them, that steel, and all of that stuff that they talk about going up into the air, but if it's got to go up into the air, maybe we should be making them instead of China, Germany and other places. <APPLAUSE> The Obama-Clinton EPA spent billions on failed climate projects instead of repairing water infrastructure in cities like Flint. Remember Flint? What a shame. My administration will address important environmental priorities, like the Everglades, and ensure quality water all across America, including the fixing of water problems like Lake Okeechobee. It's amazing, you know, Lake Okeechobee. They're always letting the water out. Do you ever notice we always have droughts? They're always letting the water out. I said keep it in, we won't have so many droughts, we won't have any droughts. But Lake Okeechobee -- and, you know, a lot of things have happened. Hillary has received millions of dollars from donors who want to shut down American energy altogether. Radical activists, like Tom Steyer, have promised to spend more than $70 million this election to get Clinton and Democrats like her elected. In return, Clinton wants to shut down energy production all across the United States. Wait until you see your energy bills. We're going to put the miners and the steelworkers of our country back to work. We'll do it. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton and Al Gore support the Paris deal which will cost America over $5 trillion and cause Florida electricity rates to skyrocket over the years, skyrocket. Think of it, we're going to spend $5 trillion. And you know what's going to happen? We're going to become noncompetitive with other countries. Other countries are eating our lunch right now. They're eating our lunch. We're going to become noncompetitive. The Paris deal also allows China, the world's largest polluter by far, to increase emissions for more than a dozen years while the United States makes drastic cuts immediately, right now. What's that all about? Why aren't we doing it together? What's that about? Who negotiates our deals? It's one more way the Clintons have surrendered American prosperity to China and so many other countries. We are led by people that are grossly incompetent. They're grossly incompetent. How about the $400 million in cash that they gave Iran that turned out to be $1.7 billion? <BOOING> You know what $1.7 billion is? It's like this stage loaded up with money. Nobody's ever seen it. Can you imagine these people in Iran when they see the money? They say, can you believe this? Boy, did we hit the jackpot. Three years ago, before we made them rich, as a country they were ready to go, but we made them rich, we made them rich. How about the 800 people ready for deportation? Remember, two weeks ago, ready for deportation, they made a mistake, they all became United States citizens, right? And these were people that were not exactly too good, that's why they were being deported. But the 800 turned out to be wrong. Somebody actually said Trump was wrong on the number. I said, oh, man, here we got. Was it 400, was it 799? Not, I guess it was, what, 1,700, 1,800 it turned out. It was much more than the 800. They said I was wrong because I was low. The whole thing is crazy. So I said, you know what? That's OK, just reverse the -- you know, you can deport them. They said that wouldn't be constitutional. Hey, folks, folks, we're being led by stupid people. We're being led by stupid people. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary Clinton will be worse than Obama. If I'm elected president, we are going to start winning again. We don't win anymore. The WikiLeaks speeches even showed Clinton praising the president of China for promising to assert his authority. My energy proposals will unlock the $50 trillion in energy reserves right here in America. This means new jobs in Florida, not new jobs in China. We're going to make America first, folks. America first. <APPLAUSE> It's all part of our plan to make America rich again. But to make America rich again, we also have to repeal and replace the disaster known as ""Obamacare."" <APPLAUSE> Bill Clinton, in a rare moment of truth-telling, said ""Obamacare"" was a crazy system where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. Now, on this he was right, right? On this he was right. We've got to give him credit. Oh, boy, did he suffer that night. Can you imagine? That was last week. He suffered gravely when he went home. The next day he came in, he said -- he made another -- sort of, I'm only kidding, I'm only kidding. Premiums are going to surge next year here in Florida beyond what you've ever seen before and all across the country. I just left Texas, great state, they've gone up 60 percent through Blue Cross Blue Shield, 60 percent. And remember this, the election on November 8th, they're trying to announce many of these massive increases after the election. Don't let it happen. You're going to have 100 percent increases, you're going to have 95 percent increases. But you've already got 68 percent, 72 percent. Insurers are fleeing, patients are losing their doctors. Remember, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan? Twenty-eight times, Obama said that. He lied! And the best students don't want to be doctors anymore. They used to want to be doctors. Doctors have more accountants working for them now than they have nurses, it's so complicated. It's a giant mess, a giant catastrophe that will destroy American health care for good if we don't get rid of it. And this election is going to be so pivotal in terms of your health care, in terms of costs for health care. So remember, you're going to get great health care at a far, far reduced cost. It's going to be much less expensive. This ""Obamacare"" is a nightmare. It is a nightmare. And by the way, Hillary Clinton wants to go to single payer. The government's going to take care of your everything. It's going to cost so much money. You know, in Canada, where they have a better version than what she's talking about, when people with some money want an operation, they come into the United States to get it. It's slow, it doesn't work, doesn't work anywhere. We have concepts that are so good. In fact, concepts that are so good that they'll only get better, so much less money. So we have to repeal and replace ""Obamacare."" It's killing the country and it's killing the people that have to pay for it <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> But you have to get out if we're going to do it and you have to vote. We're going to replace ""Obamacare"" with health savings accounts so you can choose the private doctor that you want. At the center of our economic revival, we'll be fixing our terrible, terrible trade deals. If you remember, on June 16th of last year, that is when I said we're going to run. You know, it takes a lot of guts and courage to do this. I started off, there were 17 people, great people, all nice people, some didn't, you know, honor their pledge, but these are minor details, right? But we had some great people, many of whom are supporting us, Dr. Ben Carson we have, a great guy, great guy, good man. <APPLAUSE> Chris Christie, I mean, we have incredible support. Mike Huckabee, he's been so great on television, he's so good. <APPLAUSE> He's so good. He said the other night Donald Trump won that debate by a landslide, but that doesn't mean the press is going to report that. They all reported Trump won. But Mike Huckabee said it better. He said Trump won it easy, not even a contest. But that doesn't mean that the CNNs of the world will say that. OK? They won't ever say it. They will never say it. If the late great Abraham Lincoln debated and he was representing our point of view, CNN would say Abe Lincoln went down to a massive defeat. I mean, these are dishonest people we're dealing with. These are very, very dishonest people. And it's really a shame. And their ratings are not very good either, that's good. You know why? Because some people they lose credibility. The New York Times is losing credibility. Remember, they wrote the story about Trump with women? It was on the front page of The New York Times, that I was a little bit lewd -- lewd? But they had the story a few months ago with women and they put it on the front page of The New York Times and then the women called in and said I didn't say that. I like him a lot, he's a great guy. You know, from 30 years ago and 20 years ago and 15 years ago. And I was so honored that they had the courage to do it. But The Times never gave me, you know, any kind of a retraction. It's a disgrace. What's going on with the media is disgraceful and it's happening to all of us, believe me, it's happening to all of us. Forty-seven million Americans are living in poverty and 45 million Americans are on food stamps. This is the legacy of Obama/Clinton. My economic reforms on energy, taxes, regulations and trade will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years. It's going to be unbelievable. I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, believe me. <APPLAUSE> The state of Florida has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China deals happened.
<AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, I love you, too, darling. <APPLAUSE> I love Florida! I love the people of Florida! I've created many, many jobs in Florida, many, many jobs. You know, jobs in Miami Beach, Doral is a tremendous success and Mar-a- Lago and the clubs and we've done all of that. Hillary has done nothing for Florida. And remember, when we were in the primary, I ran against Marco, Jeb, all these guys, and we had a great -- hey, look Marco's been very, very nice lately and I hope he wins, I do. But we won by 21 points. Remember that? Everyone said, what happened? How about all of these states? You know, I went into a couple of states, Trump was one point down, doesn't look like -- and then we win by, like, 14 points. We could have this happen. We're pretty even in Florida and I'm a little disappointed because Hillary hasn't created a job and I've created thousands of jobs in Florida, thousands. <APPLAUSE> I mean, at Doral I have over a thousand people working just at Doral itself. Mar-a-Lago, Trump International, many, many jobs, buildings along the beach in Miami. You know, we've created a lot of jobs. So, Florida, if you guys don't vote me as a victor I'm going to be very angry at you. Hillary doesn't come down to Florida. She comes down to Florida to try and get your vote, then you won't see her anymore. If Hillary Clinton gets in, the manufacturing that's left in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan will be shipped to other countries, shipped overseas and go to Mexico. Look, there's no doubt about that. If I win, day one we're going to announce our plans to totally renegotiate NAFTA which is a one-way street for businesses to leave our country. <APPLAUSE> They get the businesses, they get the cash. And you know what we get? We get the drugs, that's what we get. We get nothing. We get unemployment and we get drugs. The years of all-talk, no-action politicians like her will end. I'm not controlled by special interests, so I'll immediately begin to go to work on this. That's why I'm putting up my own money, for the most part, other than we're getting massive amounts of small contributions, average $61. You saw the numbers. In fact, they're going to be announced tomorrow, set records for a Republican on the small contributions. I love that. I love that. And we're doing good. And we just came out with a new commercial on crooked Hillary. She's crooked as a $3 bill. I used to say a $2 bill, but now they make $2 bills. If we don't get the deal we want on NAFTA -- remember this, remember I said it -- we will leave NAFTA and start over again and make a much better deal. OK? We will terminate. <APPLAUSE> A Trump administration will also stand up to China's product dumping and currency cheating and the steel. What they're doing to our steel companies is unbelievable with the dumping. We're going to start making things again in America. We're going to have Apple make their iPhones and make things in this country, not make everything in China and Vietnam and these other countries. <APPLAUSE> We're going to bring Apple and many other companies, they're going to be back in the United States. Our jobs, we're going with much lower business taxes. We're bringing the tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and we are going to be booming again. Our taxes are so high, our taxes are so high that businesses are forced to leave. And by the way, when businesses want to be ripped out of Florida, ripped out of your community, not going to happen anymore because there's going to be consequences. Like Carrier air conditioning in the state of Indiana, where Mike Pence, by the way, is doing a great job for me. Do we like Mike? <APPLAUSE> OK. So Mike did a great job. He absolutely beat Tim Kaine, who, you know, Tim Kaine raised taxes in his first week when he was governor of Virginia, not a popular governor, he raised them by $4 billion. Mike on the other hand, Indiana, you take a look, I mean, he has done such a great job. So here's my question to you? By cheering, who did better in the debate? Are you ready? You're going to cheer, you're going to let me know. So I did very well. Did you see Hillary today? Did everybody see the debate? Yeah, you lost, got killed. No, I look forward. Next week we have another one. I look forward. Hey, did you see -- wait, wait, wait. Did you see where she said that I entered her space. So here I am, I'm standing, right? You saw that. This is a liar. So I'm standing at my podium, I've got my chair, and crooked Hillary walks across the stage right in front of me. I'm standing. I didn't move, right? Right? So I'm standing and she walks across the stage, she's standing right in front of me. I didn't care. I didn't care. And she's answering a question and then she walks right back. OK, that's fine. I didn't make a big deal. Next day I read the paper, he entered my space. She entered my space, right? But did you see what she said, that I entered her space? I didn't move. And I was very careful because years ago somebody did come in and talk to her and the poor guy, Lazio, he got just killed. So I said I'm not getting near this woman. No, I'm not getting near this woman at all, no interest, no interest, I have no interest. <APPLAUSE> But you saw that, right? So I'm standing there, she walks, she stands right next to me. And the next day they said Donald Trump entered her space. These are dishonest people. Anyway, but next week we have another debate in Las Vegas, so that'll be fun. <APPLAUSE> America, if I get elected, will become -- when, when? They always go, when, when? But I like to, you know -- gotta leave here, you don't want to sound too egotistical. The polls are pretty even in Florida. You don't let me down! <APPLAUSE> Don't let me down. Honestly, don't let yourselves down maybe more importantly. America will become the great jobs magnet of the world, remember that. We're also going to fix our inner cities and help our Latino Americans. And believe me, that's what we have to do. The Hispanics in this country have been treated very unfairly. The African Americans have been treated very, very unfairly. Forty-five percent of African-American youth live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of American-American youth don't have jobs. Only 41 percent own their own home. That's much, much lower than other groups, 41 percent. That's a very low number, one of the lowest. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January 1st, 3,000 people. So the inner cities don't have jobs, have a lousy education, right, have lousy, horrible, and they're unsafe. You get shot walking to the store. So I say to the African Americans suffering in our inner cities, what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, what do you have to lose? <APPLAUSE> I will fix it. I will do the job. And in four years from now when we have another election, I will win with African Americans and I will win with Hispanics in very large numbers. We're going to fix it. These politicians have been lying to you for years, these Democrats. They've run the inner cities for up to a hundred years, even more, uninterrupted, and they come for your vote every four years. Hillary Clinton comes for your vote and you'll get a vote and then after you get the vote she'll say bye-bye, I'll see you in four years. She doesn't do anything. She didn't do anything for New York state. Remember upstate New York? A disaster. She came out and she said in upstate New York she's going to create 200,000 jobs. Guess what? Everybody left, it was, like, a disaster. She was a disaster. And she's a bad person, remember that. She's a bad, bad person. I will fight harder for you than anyone ever has fought before. And that's why I want to get the African-American vote and I want to get the Hispanic vote. We're going to fix your communities, we're going to fix those inner cities for once and for all. We're going to fix them and we're going to create jobs and great education. And we're going to have safe inner cities instead of these horrible, horrible death traps. And that's what they are. <APPLAUSE> We're going to fight for the Latinos trapped in poverty, that includes school choice for every low-income African-American and Latino, Hispanic child in this nation. Disadvantaged children will be able to send their kids to the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice. I also have a message for our wonderful Cuban-American community. Any Cubans here? Cuban, Cuban American? Not too many, but I'll say it anyway, all right? Obama made a one-sided deal with the Castro regime by executive order. Everything's executive order because he doesn't have enough time because he's playing so much golf. He doesn't have enough time to convince Congress to do it. This guy plays more golf than people on the PGA tour. We will cancel the Obama order unless we get the deal that we want, including political and religious freedom for the people of Cuba. We will also stand with our friends in Venezuela as they struggle for freedom. And Doral is located in a big community where we have tremendous numbers of people from Venezuela, amazing people. The people of Venezuela and Cuba know how dangerous corruption is and how dangerous socialism is, two more reasons why we have to keep crooked Hillary Clinton out of the White House. <APPLAUSE> Here are some more amazing things as we finish up that we're going to do for our country starting in 2017, right around the corner. We are going to massively cut taxes and regulations. She is going to increase taxes substantially. We're going to protect internet freedom. You see where they want to sell now, they want to have the internet run by the world? Right? Did you see what Obama wants to do? Oh, I hope we can stop that deal fast. Did you see that? Wants to give up that tremendous right. We're going to defend religious liberty. <APPLAUSE> We're going to safeguard our very obsolete electrical grid from cyberattack. Cyberattack is a new, big problem. We're going to rebuild our depleted military. And we are going to take care of our great veterans. We have tremendous veteran support, tremendous veteran support. <APPLAUSE> We're going to construct a state-of-the-art system of missile defense. We're going to expand America's true role as a leader in space. We are going to save our Second Amendment which is under siege by Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> And the National Rifle Association, the NRA, as you know, endorsed me, the earliest endorsement they've ever given to a presidential candidate. And we are going to, and this is so important, appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> You have 28 days to make every dream that you ever dreamed for your country to come true, on November 8th, it's so important. The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face-to-face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, you. <APPLAUSE> We are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on the borders, on trade, on foreign policy, on the economy and so much more. We don't win anymore, folks. We don't win anymore. When did you see us win? We lose on trade. We can't beat ISIS. Oh, by the way, we're going to knock the hell out of ISIS. We're going to knock the hell out of them. <APPLAUSE> We're going to replace the failed leadership in Washington, who have betrayed you, squandered your wealth and sold out your country. And by the way, we're going to have very strong borders and we will build the wall and we will stop drugs from pouring in. <APPLAUSE> No, we will build the wall. OK, folks, are you ready? Who's going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico?>
<TRUMP:> Hundred percent. They might not know it yet, but they will. Look, Mexico's great and the people are great I got to meet three weeks ago. You probably saw, I went to Mexico, I met with the president and it was great. And we're going to build a way and they're going to pay. The reason they're going to pay, they're making a fortune. They're making a fortune on trade. Our trade deficit with Mexico is massive. Our trade deficit with China is beyond anything you could even imagine. Worldwide on trade, we lost almost $800 billion last year. You say to yourself, who negotiates these deals? We have a few of my friends here, they're good business people, they're sitting here and they're saying, who negotiates these deals? They're in the audience. One guy is looking at me, he's laughing now, he's saying, who? Incompetent people or corrupt people, OK? They're either incompetent or corrupt. I'm asking all Americans, Republicans, independents and Democrats, to join us in our campaign to give our government back to the American people. <APPLAUSE> I am going to fight for every citizen of every background, from every stretch of this nation. And I'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. We're a divided country, folks. We're divided in so many ways. We're going to be a unified country again. We're going to love each other, everybody, not just the people here. We're going to love each other. And by the way, is there ever a better or safer place to be than a Trump rally? <APPLAUSE> You better make sure we win or there will be no more Trump rallies, to hell with that, to hell with the rallies. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. <APPLAUSE> You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like nobody has ever seen before. It really is, it's an amazing thing. We take it for granted almost. It's an amazing thing when we go out to Pennsylvania, we had 20,000 people. We go to Alabaman, we had 35,000 people. We go to different places and we get crowds that nobody has ever seen before for what we're doing. And I don't have a guitar. Somebody said you get the biggest crowds in the world for a guy with a guitar, which is an interesting -- it's an interesting way of looking at it. <APPLAUSE> I'll tell you who said that, a very famous guy, but I better not, I'll get him in trouble. Happens to be very liberal, I will really get him in trouble. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote that you've ever cast at any time in your life, November 8th. A vote for me is a vote for change. A vote for me is really a vote for you. We're going to run things right. <APPLAUSE> America first. Remember, America first. We are going to put our country first for the first time in a long time. Once again, we're going to have a government of, by and for the people. <APPLAUSE> We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again! Thank you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you very much.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-12"">
<(APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> What a group. What a great state. <APPLAUSE> Well, you know, I just landed and I was watching on the way in and I heard Fox saying that they have a couple of thousand people, well, this is not a couple of thousand people, folks. And over there, there's thousands of people trying to get in. I wish the fire department would let them in, in all fairness. <APPLAUSE> We're outside, we don't need a fire marshal, we're outside. So fire marshal, will you let the people in please? <APPLAUSE> I assume the fire marshal is a Democrat, I assume. <LAUGHTER> Unbelievable, it never stops. But I'll tell you, we've had a - an amazing time. We just left, as you know, I know the <inaudible> Florida, which is a great, great section, especially if you like horses, and we had a crowd that you would not <inaudible>, over 15,000 people. <APPLAUSE> And they couldn't get them all in either, they never can, because there's movement going on that's amazing, and in 27 days, we are going to win Florida, and we are going to win back... <APPLAUSE> We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals. We're going to reduce surging crime, which is going down and bad, bad numbers. We're going to cut taxes, big league, and she is going to raise your taxes big league. <BOOING> We're going to get rid of many of our unnecessary regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, and we're going to end Common Core. <APPLAUSE> We're going to reduce to cost of college, which is going up in record setting pace, make child care affordable, so important. And we are going to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> We're going to put America first and we're going to be united in our love for our country. We are a divided country right now, divided almost like never before. We are going to be a united country again. <APPLAUSE> This election is a simple choice. It's a choice between putting our faith in a corrupt establishment or putting our faith in you, the American people. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA, USA, USA.>
<TRUMP:> You know, I just said, in front of this big, big crowd. We just literally left, can't believe we're going to end up doing -- the last two weeks I said we're going to do four or five of these a day, can you believe that? <APPLAUSE> Now, let me ask you. First of all, Hillary has very small crowds, nobody cares, but... <LAUGHTER> How many of these do you think Hillary could do a day? Maybe a half. I was at this massive -- it was just like a really hot building. It was a steep toe <ph>, it was over 100 degrees, we went for an hour and 10 minutes, the people were unbelievable, and I said jokingly, I said if the people of Florida don't vote for me, I'm going to be very angry. And one of the news commentators said, Donald Trump admonished <ph> the people of Florida. <LAUGHTER> And you know who I'm talking about. These guys are so crooked, their worse than Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> I think they might be more crooked than Hillary and that's saying a lot. <BOOING> I couldn't believe it, I'm watching it -- I said, I'm going to be so angry at the people of Florida, joking, everybody's joking, everybody's laughing, and he said, he admonished <ph> the people of Florida. They make us sound like such jerks, it's unbelievable. I tell you what, these are the most dishonest people you'll ever see. These are horrible, horrible people. Now I know I'm <inaudible> and you know who I'm talking about back there, you should be ashamed of yourself. <APPLAUSE> It's a choice between the pessimism of the Hillary Clinton and the optimism of a move empowered by millions of people all over the country. <APPLAUSE> She's been there for 30 years and hasn't don't anything but fail, take a look at what she's done. And during the last debate, which you know look, I want to partial and all, which I won big league, I mean that was not even close. <APPLAUSE> How about this? I'm standing at the podium, my podium, I'm standing by my chair, right? I'm standing and she walks across, I said hi Hillary, how are you doing? She walks across, and she stands in front of me and then the next I wake up by saying, oh we got all good reviews. But wait, of all of the online polls, we won 10 out of 10 by big margins but forget it. <APPLAUSE> Forget it, forget it. So I'm standing at my podium by my chair. She walks across the room, she's standing in front of me, right next to me, and the next day I say, what did the papers say? They say, he invaded her space. I invaded her space. <LAUGHTER> Believe me, the last space that I want to invade is her space, believe me. I don't want to invade her space. <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> We're still trying to let these poor people come in. Come on fire marshal, do your job.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! She shouldn't be allowed to run for president. She shouldn't be allowed, I'm telling you. She should not be allowed to run for president based on her crimes. She should not be allowed to run for president. It's time for a new direction. Our movement is about rebuilding our country, reuniting our citizens and revitalizing the spirit of our nation. I'm asking you to believe in America once again. I'm asking you to believe in the American dream once again. Going to happen. (APPLAUSE) The deadline for voter registration has just been extended. Make sure to register, folks. Who here has not registered? You have permission - front row. The guys stands here for hours and he's not registered? You have permission to leave here right now and register. Not a lot of people. Anybody not registered yet? Anybody? That's great. Wow, that's impressive. I think we're going to have little Brexit (ph) coming up with November 8, I think. Because Hillary's dying with her crowds. You don't have to fill in the seats. You see the crowds yet yesterday? And you saw the crowds - we're getting all of - every place not just in Florida, no matter where we go. Ohio, Pennsylvania, and it's a movement like they've never seen before. So, we've had an interesting time but the press isn't reporting it. That's - you know what I'm talking about, right? We hearing this right? We hearing this (ph)? It's big stuff but the press does not report it because honestly without the press, without the media, Hillary Clinton is nothing. She's nothing. OK? She's nothing. And she talks about my relationship with the Russians. What do I know about the Russians? What do I know about the Russians? Then they said he borrows money from - I don't borrow money from the Russians. I promise you I've never made - I don't have any deals with Russia. I had Miss Universe there a couple of years ago other than that no. I had nothing to do. But then on WikiLeaks it came in that she said all these wonderful things about Putin. OK? Maybe we should reverse it. We'll reverse it. Except for one thing. I think if we got along with the Russians that would be good and frankly if we get along with Russians and together we knock the hell out of ISIS, that would be great. (APPLAUSE) To me, that would be smart, OK? But we don't run government smart. We have people that are not smart running government. How about the 800 people that were going to be deported? You saw that three, four weeks ago. They were going to be deported. They were not such good people, they were going to be deported. You know, this country, when they want to deport you, you've got to be bad. And by the way, ICE just gave us their endorsement first time ever. And the border patrol, all the agents just gave - 16,500 agents just gave us their support. So they had 800 people -- 800 people going to be deported - ahh (ph) they had a problem. But instead of deporting them, they became United States citizens. (BOOING) And instead of 800 people, I've (ph) got some bad news for you. It turned out to be 1,800 people that became United States citizens. So, when I said, all right they made a mistake, you know what kind of a mistake it was, right? Bing, bing, bing (ph). OK (ph) Don't kid yourself, good chance of that. Bope (ph) - does everybody see that? The front people know exactly, right? But I said - (inaudible) said that's OK just undo it and deport them. They said that would not be constitutional, sir. I said that wouldn't be. In other words, we're violating our constitution. How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are we to be led by these incompetent people? And all Obama does is campaign. All he does is campaign. I have a feeling he doesn't want to see me get in. Do you agree with that? Not (ph) when he said Donald Trump - he said Donald Trump would never win the Republican primary. He will never win. Well, sorry folks, but that's what it is (ph). Sorry president! President. The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake on November 8th. She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office. The Wikileaks e-mail showed the Department of Justice fed information to Clinton. Now think of this, she's under investigation. The Department of Justice - you know what? They're (ph) leaked (ph). Oh (ph) really? Ah, a doctor. Is there a doctor in the house? Thought it was a protest, we don't have any protests. Is there a doctor in the house? We've got to take care of people. Always take care of people. (APPLAUSE)>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!>
<AUDIENCE: President Trump! President Trump! President Trump! President Trump! (APPLAUSE)>
<AUDIENCE: President Trump! President Trump!>
<TRUMP:> So - so we love those people. You know they stand here for hours? They stand here for hours. And I'll tell you what, see that woman? She went down, she'll be back. They all come back. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We had one yesterday in a tremendous heat wave. A tremendous - I mean <ph> the place was hot. And then, you know, I always like to say it's 100 degrees because it is. Because some times if it's really hot and if I'm doing a little sweat - not too much, I'm not too bad. We've all seen worse in the campaign trail, haven't we? But if I'm doing a little, they'll say, ""Donald Trump was sweating."" It's 109 degrees at <ph> these <ph>. <LAUGHING>
<TRUMP:> But you know these people, when they go down they do go down. And they all come back. I don't even know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. But our friends have courage, it's unbelievable. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Sorry about <ph> that <ph>. But make sure she's great. So the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared when they came into the interview. Did you ever hear a thing? We have Mayor Giuliani one of the great mayors - one of the great prosecutors. Where is he? Where is our mayor? Where is our mayor?
<AUDIENCE: (Off-mike)>
<TRUMP:> As you know, he was one of the great prosecutors. He said, ""As long as I've done this, I've never heard of anything."" And what's happened with the FBI is so sad. And you have great, great people in the FBI and I wouldn't know - although it looks like we're reading stories about it, they are so disgusted at what's gone on at the top. They cannot even believe what's going on with the great institution of the FBI. They cannot believe what is going at the FBI. These are unbelievable Americans, these are unbelievable people. They could not believe. And for the attorney general to meet in the back of an airport <ph> with Bill Clinton just prior to making this totally phony decision -- this totally disgusting, phony decision -- to meet in the back of an airplane because he just happened to be there - he just happened. He just happened to be - he was in Arizona - a place that I love and a place that we're going to win big, by the way. You watch. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Because they like having borders. They are getting inundated with drugs. But it was in Arizona -- now do you know how hot it was that day? It was so hot. So he was there to play golf, he said, right? But you happen to see <ph> <inaudible> oh, it's the Attorney General, gee that's -- what a coincidence. Let me go in through the back of the plane. See that plane, and other planes that I've had over the years -- I've never had anyone like, oh, I see someone on the runway. Oh, let them in for a little while, let's chat. Never anybody in years and years. So she let him in, oh, come on in. Hi. How you doing? How's everything? They talked about grandchildren, and -- what else? -- they talked about golf. Now, 39 minutes is a long time. Let's figure you talk about the grandchildren for 3, and the golf for 3 1/2. He probably gets up and shows his swing or something, right? You don't have any room in the plane, that's the problem. Not on that plane <inaudible>. No, I'm only kidding <ph>. But tell me -- then he left and nobody saw him on the golf course. By the way, isn't it shocking? He didn't get to play, I guess. Folks, what's happening to our country is a disgrace. It's never happened before. And in fact, she lied in front of Congress to such an extent -- and I'll tell you what, I'm very disappointed in Congress, both Republican and Democrat, that they don't find a way to do something. <APPLAUSE> Because they give the information to the Department of Justice, they give the information that she lied to the FBI, and she could do whatever she wants to do and they're not going to prosecute her, because it's a total fix and it's a disgrace. <BOOING> This corruption is just one more reason why I will ask my attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor. <APPLAUSE> And furthermore -- furthermore, we are going to investigate this phony investigation. It's a phony investigation. Hillary Clinton -- please. You know how expensive <ph> it is? Nobody ever heard of it. I have people very sophisticated in the world of e-mails and all of these things <ph>, they never even heard of the bleaching. The reason they did it <ph>, it's an unbelievably expensive process. Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after a congressional subpoena. So she gets a subpoena -- she gets a subpoena, and after -- not before, that wouldn't <ph> be bad. But after getting a subpoena to give over your e-mails and lots of other things, she deleted the e- mails. She has to go to jail. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up. Lock her up.>
<TRUMP:> And her law firm, which is a very big and powerful law firm, which is the one that said, oh, they'll determine what they're giving <ph> -- those representatives within that law firm that did that have to go to jail. <APPLAUSE> She then had 13 telephones -- and many of them were hammered dead. Now, how many people have gotten rid of a cell phone and hammered the hell of it? How? I need hands up, please, hands up. Did anybody hammer -- uh oh, he did. What's your business? Oh. Is he in the mob? What's your business? These are illegal acts. You know, if you do this privately, it's a criminal act. And look at what happened -- look at what happened to other people like General Petraeus for doing a tiny fraction. Their lives have been destroyed. She's running for president and she's being protected. And these people, the most dishonest people other than Hillary that you have, these people are protecting her because without the press, she is nothing. She is nothing. <BOOING> And this has been her whole life. From <inaudible> making one of the great returns <ph> ever because it was done dishonestly. To Whitewater, everything has been the lies <ph>. But more importantly, take a look at her deals; Libya, Syria, ISIS. Look at what happened -- she wanted to get rid of ISIS. When she was in, ISIS didn't exist essentially. She created the vacuum for ISIS. The e-mails also show how the Clintons ripped off the wonderful people of <inaudible> doing favors for their friends and special interest -- look at <inaudible> coming back. <APPLAUSE> That woman was out cold and now she's coming back <ph>. See? <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> We don't go by these new and very much softer NFL rules -- concussion, a little ding on the head, no, you can't play for the rest of the season. Our people are tough. <APPLAUSE> So Americans, honestly, I've had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption -- this corruption. This will finally be the year the American people can say enough is enough. Enough is enough. <APPLAUSE> The Clintons are a very dishonest and very bad pairing. I mean, Bill Clinton was impeached for lying, he totally lied. He lost his law license. Remember this, you know, some people thought Hillary was smart. I don't think she's smart. Look how badly she performed in the last debate. <APPLAUSE> Look, I thought she was terrible. Now, look, look, look at how badly she performed. She went to Washington, D.C., she took her bar exam and she failed, right? Oh, she's a genius. <LAUGHTER> She failed the bar exam -- they'll go and check it, but trust me folks, she failed her bar exam. She couldn't pass it, so she went someplace else and got her license to hurt people. The Clintons in <ph> the past <inaudible>. We, as a group, as a movement <inaudible> we are leaders here <ph>. We're going to be the future. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: (OFF-MIKE)>
<TRUMP:> If we had a little -- if we had a little help <ph> from our very weak leadership, from the <ph> Republican leadership, we would be sailing <ph> like we've never sailed <ph> before. These are weak people. The new <ph> e-mails also show members of the Clinton team viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals. <BOOING> No, the press doesn't want to report that one. That could be a <inaudible>. It's just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign has for every day faithful Americans. If you're a person of faith, I think you're going to vote for Donald Trump. And I have such <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton...
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> So do you believe the last 10 days, five to six of these a day? <APPLAUSE> I may be limping over the finish line, but we're going to get to that side. <APPLAUSE> Now, the press will report -- the press, this dishonest group of <inaudible>. <BOOING> Here's what the press will report. ""He said that he was going to limp over the line."" Come on, Paul. You can do better, Carl. You can do better. Campaign Carl. Hillary Clinton thinks you're deplorable and irredeemable. <BOOING> I call you hard-working American patriots and together we are going to save our country. <APPLAUSE> These e-mails also reveal that crooked Hillary Clinton believes in global governance, unlimited immigration -- there goes your country. <BOOING> And world-wide corporations. Speaking in a select group -- to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said, ""My dream is a hemispheric common market."" There goes your -- there go the rest of your jobs. With open trade and totally open borders. OK. That's good. OK. No more country. You know what? I want to have free trade too, but I want to have smart trade. We have trade where we benefit for a change because we have lost our jobs, we have lost our money, we owe $20 trillion...
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!>
<TRUMP:> We don't make our product anymore.
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!>
<TRUMP:> We will build the wall. <APPLAUSE> And Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent, 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> One hundred percent. Great people. I met with the president of Mexico, month and a half ago. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> I thought this was set up by the presidential commission on debates. So why don't you -- why don't you -- those guys are. Talk about a mic that didn't work in the first debate. You know what they said? The head guy came over and I said, ""My mic wasn't working. Why didn't you fix it?"" He said, ""We knew it didn't work, but we wanted to find out. So as soon as the debate was over, we wanted to find out what the problem"" -- oh thanks a lot. I appreciate it. <BOOING> We don't care if we stand in the rain, do we?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> I'll take my hat off. I'll get my hair nice and wet. <APPLAUSE> That's the end of this suit. That's OK. Behind closed doors when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America. Hillary wants to end forever the American independence that our soldiers fought for and died for to keep and protect us. We will never surrender the freedom and sovereignty of the United States of America. <APPLAUSE> A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. Without borders, we don't have a country. Under the Obama-Clinton policies, illegal immigrants simply show up at the border and they're released into the United States. And that's why the Border Patrol agents in ICE are so upset. And it could be so easy for them. But these are great Americans. They want to do it right. And they know that what we're doing and who we're allowing into our country is wrong and bad for our country. I've met the family of Sarah Root, an unbelievable young girl killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 grade average - the top of her class. Her killer was released by Obama, meaning the Obama representatives at the border. She should have been held. The killer should have been held, released against the will of agents by a policy that's sick and weak, and disgusting. Released, went on to kill. And kill again, and kill again. And Hillary wants to go even further. The ICE officers who endorsed me, their first endorsement ever, said that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in United States history. Hillary also wants to increase Syrian refugees by 550 percent over Obama. <BOOING> Think of it. Obama's letting 'em in by the thousands. By the way, this guy only does is campaign, he is the worst. This - even though she admitted in private according to WikiLeaks - I -- don't you wish the press would pick up WikiLeaks and report it? <APPLAUSE> What - what they said about the Justice Department, what they said about Catholics, what they said about Evangelicals, they must be dying watching this. But you know what? They know it's OK 'cause they know it's not gonna be properly reported. <BOOING> But she knows the terrorists are trying to infiltrate through the refugee program. She said that. She knows that's gonna happen. And yet the refugees, she wants to pour in. The terrorists have already infiltrated our country. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in all 50 states. Attack after attack, including the recent terrorist strikes in New Jersey and New York, Minnesota that were made possible by our extremely open and extremely weak immigration system. The Orlando terrorist was the son of a Taliban supporter who sat right behind Hillary during a speech, from Afghanistan. The examples go on and on. The shooter in San Bernardino, the killer who slaughtered four Marines in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the recent mall shooter in Washington state were all admitted by authorities into the United States. They should never have been allowed to come in to our country. <APPLAUSE> So let me state this clearly. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> At the same time we're going to completely rebuild our very dilapidated - look. Our military. It's in such - these are the greatest people on earth. Our military is completely - we're gonna rebuild our military. That includes building a state of the art missile defense system. We are going to be protected. We are going to be strong. We are going to be strong. We are going to take care of our great veterans. Our veterans have been horribly treated. <APPLAUSE> When it comes to keeping America safe I believe in three very important words. Peace through strength. <APPLAUSE> But a strong country - we have to be a rich country. Sad. A woman came up, she said, ""Mr. Trump that doesn't sound nice."" Sorry folks. We want to protect your Social Security. We want to protect your Medicare. She won't be able to do it. Hillary doesn't have a clue. Take a look at what she did to New York State. She said she was going to bring 200,000 jobs to upstate New York. It was a total disaster. People poured out of New York. They poured out of upstate New York. I am going to make America rich again. The Paris Climate deal - and I believe so much in the environment. Believe it or not, people are shocked - I've won many environmental awards. Many. But the Paris deal, supported by Hillary, will cost our country another $5.3 trillion over a period of time and skyrocket electricity prices in a very great state that's my second home. What's that state? <APPLAUSE> We will cancel this deal so that our companies can compete. And again, we want clean beautiful air. And we want crystal clear water. That's what we want. And we want to be able to do business throughout the world, not so that we can't compete because of these crazy deals that our president is making. We are going to unlock the $50 trillion in energy reserves right here under your feet in America. <APPLAUSE> This means many new jobs in Florida and all across America. That also means cheaper energy for our farmers, cheaper energy for everybody. We're going to take care of Florida farmers, and Florida agriculture. And we're going to take care of our steelworkers who are under siege from China, and we're going to take care of our miners who are practically being put out of business. <APPLAUSE> The Obama-Clinton crew spent $50 billion on climate programs when they should have used that money to help Florida farmers fight diseases that threaten your crops. And that's happening all over. And by the way, when Clinton was secretary of state, missing, missing, or gone, nobody can figure it out - maybe someday they will, and maybe they'll never find it - missing. Six billion dollars - oh but she'll be a wonderful president. She's going to be -- she'll be a wonderful president. Remember, ISIS -- here was ISIS when she started. Now, ISIS is in 32 different countries, and now she stands up, ""I will fight ISIS very hard."" <LAUGHTER> You're funny. ""We're going to fight ISIS very, very hard."" There was no ISIS. She created the vacuum, along with our incompetent president. She created the vacuum and ISIS formed. This money should have been invested in infrastructure, like the Hoover Dam. A Trump administration will invest in projects like dams and railroads and fast trains and grids. Our electrical grid is obsolete and dangerous. We will return the EPA to its core mission. That same clean air and clean water that I just mentioned, and that means the water for Lakeland, and we have to remember that, right? <APPLAUSE> Unless you don't want this. Everybody likes clean water, maybe. <APPLAUSE> Maybe. And we could save a couple of bucks. Let it be dirty just for Lakeland, no? No. OK. Well, I promise it will be crystal clear, crystal clear. OK? <APPLAUSE> Just -- I'm just testing you. I'm just testing. I thought maybe you wouldn't mind. We could save a couple of bucks for the country. OK? <APPLAUSE> At the center of our -- and that's very true, yes. At the center of our economic revival, we'll be fixing our terrible trade deals. When I announced I was running, who knew this was going to happen? Remember? All of these guys, they can't believe what's going on. I'll tell you. These crooked people back there, they cannot believe it. <LAUGHTER> Remember? Remember this guy Charles Krauthammer, where he goes, ""Well, Donald Trump has not done this, he has no chance. Oh, really? <Inaudible>. <LAUGHTER> I have a lot of friends who made a lot of money betting because when they had me down to three percent. I had a friend -- he's one of the smartest guys in business. He said, ""You know what, Donald? In all fairness, I'll bet on you at three percent any time."" That made a lot of money. <APPLAUSE> But one by one, we knocked them off, right? I knocked them off for you. The movement knocked them off -- one by one by one by one; governors. There was a time when I was three or four months into it, where it said, ""Trump has four months of experience, and all of the people he's running against have 233 years."" So it's four months versus 233 years, and here we are, folks. <APPLAUSE> You see, because as I've always said, experience is very important, but competence is much more important. I've always said that. I know. <APPLAUSE> Forty-seven million Americans are in poverty. And 45 million Americans are on food stamps. This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton. My economic agenda will take in the opposite direction, and it can be summed up in three such beautiful, beautiful words, jobs, jobs, jobs. <APPLAUSE> The great state of Florida, my state, your state, has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton -- the single worst trade deal ever signed, ever negotiated in the history of the world. OK? Not here -- in the history of the world. You look at New England, you look at Florida, you look at Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan -- poor Michigan. I've been fighting for Michigan, and they don't listen, but now they're going to listen, because I'm going to bring the auto industry back to Michigan. I've been talking about it for a long time. <APPLAUSE> So, her husband signs NAFTA. NAFTA's a disaster. Hillary Clinton's South Korea deal was supposed to be wonderful for the United States. Great. It was great for South Korea. For the United States, we lost at least 100,000 jobs. Since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed disaster, 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. So when I saw that number, I said, wait a minute, go back, it's a mistake. Can't be seven -- maybe 7,000, maybe 700. Can't be 70,000. Ready, 70,000 factories -- now that won't fact check, oh, it was 69.99 -- these people are the worst. Seventy thousand, I really thought they'd made a mistake. That's 15 factories closing a day on average. We have real geniuses in Washington. Don't we? We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. This is the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world. <Inaudible>. And boy, is it going to change fast, folks. Boy is it going... <APPLAUSE> You know, we have people here today who made more money 18 years ago than they're making now. They had one job instead of two and they were a lot younger. So they're older, they make less and they have two and three jobs. Supposed to be the other way. But I always say, you're working harder now than you ever did before and you're older. Well I'm working harder now than I ever did before and I'm older, too, so I don't feel sorry for you. <APPLAUSE> Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat and Chrysler, and so many other are moving their jobs to Mexico and other places and now Florida has just announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico. <BOOING> If and when I win, we are going to renegotiate the disaster known as NAFTA. We're going to renegotiate. <APPLAUSE> And if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA, we will get out of NAFTA, we'll start all over again and believe me, we're going to make some great deals and I do believe -- I believe totally in free trade, but it's got to be fair trade. It's got to be trade when like some - let's - let's let some of the crumbs come our way. You know what we get? We get the drugs and the unemployment. Mexico gets the jobs, the factories, the money, the income. We get the drugs, they get the cash. Oh, isn't that wonderful. Our youth is being poisoned. Our people are being poisoned with the drugs that are pouring across that border. We're going to end that very fast. <APPLAUSE> We will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal that Hillary Clinton in the debate swore that -- she said, I never said that there was a gold standard. The crazy fact checkers said, I was right. I can't believe it. She did say -- and you know what, if she ever got into that deal, nothing's as bad as NAFTA, but that deal will be -- trust that will take a lot of your jobs out of Florida. That will take a lot of your jobs out of everywhere, but it will take a lot of your Florida jobs. The backers of that deal have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton and they want her to get that deal approved. It's a very bad deal for our country. It's going to take more jobs, it's a very, very bad deal. TPP, hopefully I'm there, I will end it so fast and we'll make deals with individual countries, not this big web of complicated stuff over 5,000 pages that nobody from our country even reads. <APPLAUSE> Don't forget Obamacare. Thousands and thousands of pages and in Congress I think they said almost nobody even read it. And that's why -- look, it was a disaster anyway, whether they read it or not. But TPP is great for other countries, but bad for us. We'll do it nice and simple. We like a country... MORE
<TRUMP:> -- whether they read it or not. But TPP is great for other countries but bad for us. We'll do it nice and simple. We like a country? Boom, we do a trading deal. Another one, we do a trading deal. Another one. And if they don't behave, and if they don't live up to the deal, we send them what's called a notice of termination, 30 days. It's a 30 day notice of termination, and believe me, they will come back so fast, sir, Mr. President, is there a way I can make this deal better for our country? I'll say, yes, we'll do it, but we're going to make it even better now, OK. But we have a nice, simple pad. Not this crazy web -- did you ever see this TPP? They've got arrows all over the place going to different countries. We will be free traders, but we will free trade with our friends. We will be smart. We will be smart. And we'll bring back jobs, and we'll begin making product again. We'll begin making things. My dream as president, one of many, will be to have Apple and companies like Apple start to make their iPhones and other products in the United States, not in China and Vietnam and all of the other countries they're making them in. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton is an insider. She fights for herself. I'm an outsider -- used to be an insider, to be honest with you, OK. I know the inside and I know the outside. And that's why I'm the only one that can fix this mess, folks. Believe me. <APPLAUSE> I know the inside very well. And you know what? It's a lot easier from my position, being on the inside. But I felt I had to do this. This country has been great to me. It's been great to my family, and I felt I had to do this. And the fact that I know -- who is more of an insider than me? In all fairness, nobody, practically, nobody. So I know it from the inside and I know it from the outside, and the outside is a lot tougher, but I owe it to my country and I know I really owe it. We have such great people in this country. We're going to fix this country. We're going to get rid of these corrupt politicians. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to do it right. By the time I finish, I'll have over $100 million into my campaign. Think of that. That's a lot of money. Financed the primaries, financed this -- we have a lot of money coming in from the small donors. It never happened to a Republican before where they have this kind of money. Small donors average $61. But you know what? It's so important. And one of these characters said, it doesn't matter if you win or lose, because what you've done has never been done in the history of this country, meaning this great movement -- look at the people where they are. They did let some of those people in. That's fantastic. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Look at that. Look where that guy is. But you know what? We are going to do things, and it's so important. And I said, it does matter whether we win or lose. And let me tell you, if I don't win on November 8th, he said, you'll go down in history. Now Bernie won't go down in history. You know why? Because he made a deal with the devil. Had Bernie not made that deal, he would have gone down as a major footnote in political history. Bernie sold out to the devil. He sold out to the devil. I mean, his ideas are different than our ideas, other than he knew we were being ripped off on trade, which he's right about, but we can fix it, he couldn't. But Bernie Sanders sold out to the devil and he's gone. And now when he goes and speaks, nobody shows up anymore. Sad. We can't let that happen to us. But I said to this pundit, I said, no, you're wrong. If I lose, I will consider it the biggest waste of time, energy, and money that I've ever done in my entire life. True. So I'm not controlled by the special interests. You're my only special interest, folks, I'm telling you. <APPLAUSE> It's the people's voice be heard, and on November 8th the whole world is going to hear your voice, and the whole world is going to see what's going to happen in the United States of America. <APPLAUSE> They're going to hear you say that it's time to put America first once more. <APPLAUSE> We're going to start making things again in our country, and part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower your business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. New companies, forget <ph> it for them. <APPLAUSE> People are going to get jobs. You saw the last jobs report was a disaster. I said that ""can't be the last one before the election"", they said ""no, there's another one,"" then they came back and said ""no, sir we made a mistake."" That's the last jobs, take a look at the jobs report that came out last week, it is a disaster. Take a look at GDP, we're at one percent. If China was at one percent, it would be a national disaster. They go to seven, and eight, and nine percent, and they consider it horrible. We go to one percent, and we just keep going along folks. That means we're literally going in the wrong direction. We're also going to fix our inner cities, it's so important to me. And we're going to help our African American great people. <APPLAUSE> And our Hispanic American great people. Forty-five percent of African American youth live in poverty. African Americans have a really horrible loan rate of home ownership, far lower than the rest of the population; not good, 41 percent. Fifty-eight percent of African American youth don't have jobs. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. You don't hear these people back here, they don't want you to hear, because they want crooked Hillary to get in. <BOOING> We have - wait - we have the highest murder rate in this country in 45 years. More people are being murdered now than being murdered in 45 years. So, you look at our inners cities - you look at our inner cities, the education is no good, the schools are horrible, they education's a disaster. People are being shot walking to the grocery store, their kids are being killed. It's a disaster. There's no jobs, and there's no hope, and then for years, the Democrats have wrought the inner cities, without abate. Seventy-five years - 75 years, so here's what I said, we ought to fix the inner cities. I've look at African Americans and I say ""what the hell do you have to lose, we're going to fix it,"" we're going to fix it, I promise. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> That's so cool, I didn't tell them, that's cool. But listen, what do we have to lose, what do you have to lose? Is it going to get worse? Look at the crime rate, look at the - the education, look at the jobs; the jobs are nonexistent. Same thing for Hispanic Americans, you take a look at what they're going through, and it's so unfair. And I see all these ""Women for Trump"" signs, I love this, I don't -- <APPLAUSE> ""Women for Trump,"" I don't get these polls. Every place I go I see hundreds of women for Trump and then I see a poll. He's not doing well with women. I don't know, I don't know. You know, my daughter Ivanka, she wants child care and she can care all of them but you know women want safety for our country, they want a strong military, they don't want crime in our cities, they want to be protected by law and order. They want law and order. The women in this country want what I'm saying and we are really - I think we're saying it very strong. So, to the African Americans I say I will fix it. To the Hispanic Americans I say I will fix it. I will fight for you harder than anybody has ever fought for you. That's all of you. That's all of you. That's everybody. <APPLAUSE> We are going to make America strong again. We are going to make America safe again. We are going to make America rich again and we are going to make America great again. Thank you, God bless you everybody. God bless you. God bless you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-14"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you, thank you. Great, wow. Thank you very much. Thank you, wow. Thank you, wow.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody. Nice place, plenty of room. In 25 days we're going to win the state of North Carolina, which I love, and we're going to win the White House.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Early voting starts on October 20th, so you have to get out there. But November 8th, that's our day. November 8th, right? November 8th. But do the early voting. I'd also like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone recovering in the tragic aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. We know about it very well unfortunately right here. We send our deepest condolences for those who have lost loved ones. We are with you and we will always be with you and help you when needed. So, good luck to everybody. <APPLAUSE> The incredible spirit of the people of this state will power its recovery, and it's the same spirit that will rebuild our nation. I have property in this state, this is a great state. <APPLAUSE> You know my property. Beautiful properly, great employees. In the Trump administration we will end decades of policies that enrich special interests and foreign countries at our expense. We're going to take on the big media, big business, and big donors that are bleeding our country dry. We're losing our jobs. <APPLAUSE> We're going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals and illegal immigration. Stop the massive inflow of refugees. Take care of our vets, our great vets. And we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare, 100 percent. That is a disaster. Premiums are soaring double digits in North Carolina, beyond anybody's wildest expectations. It's a disaster and you're -- and you know what's going on. Your country will be left with only one insurer. You're going to have nothing, everyone's leaving. And you have one insurer. You're going to have nobody. Obamacare if failing, we're going to repeal it and we're going to replace it. <APPLAUSE> Your jobs come back under a Trump administration. Your income goes up under a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> Your taxes go way down under a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> You companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump administration, they'll be staying right here. And believe me, there are plenty of them right now negotiating to leave, I hate to tell you that. These are the issues that we'll discuss at the next debate, which I look very much forward to. <APPLAUSE> Crooked Hillary is doing no more public events until after the debate. They say she's doing debate prep but, really she's just resting, she's resting.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> For what -- for what she's done, they should lock her up, they should. It's disgraceful. Honestly, it's disgraceful. What's going on in our country right now is a disgrace. The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake on November the 8th. WikiLeaks released new Clinton campaign e-mails revealing how friendly Hillary was with the attorney general, Loretta Lynch. This was only months prior to Lynch's investigation of Hillary's illegal secret e-mail server that gave foreign governments access to our confidential information.
<TRUMP:> This comes on the heels of disclosure that Clinton campaign was conspiring and colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the release of her e-mails and the investigation into her server. Hillary Clinton told the FBI 39 times she couldn't remember anything. I couldn't remember, I couldn't remember. Or recall key events concerning illegal server and related misconduct. Now, in new written testimony, just out as part Freedom of Information Act request, Hillary Clinton said she couldn't remember, recall, or anything else, key events and key things 21 different times. <BOOING> It's one more reason that if I win I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. <APPLAUSE> And we also have to investigate the investigation itself. <APPLAUSE> Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after a congressional subpoena. She got a subpoena from Congress and she said, this is no good, this is terrible, because those 33,000 e-mails had bad stuff. And she said get rid of them, delete them, bleach them. Nobody bleaches because that's an expensive process. She bleached. Get rid of them. And then she made everybody get rid of iPhones, her iPhones, and some of them were hammered. They were hammered to death. All to cover up her crimes. Yesterday new disclosures were made showing again how Hillary Clinton's pay for play works. Saudi Arabia paid Bill Clinton a lot of money to make a speech and then got an arms deal from Hillary and her State department that they were unable to get. The nation of Qatar also kicked in $1 million for Bill Clinton's birthday party, so nice. But, as WikiLeaks showed the Clinton's ripped off the people of Haiti as they were suffering and dying after the earthquake. And her brother's on the board of a gold mine, her brother. But, the media's covering up for the Clintons and their many crimes against so many people. The WikiLeaks documents show how the media conspires and collaborates with the Clinton campaign including giving the questions and answers to Hillary Clinton before the debate, OK. <BOOING> What a rigged system folks. Last night, we had a massive crowd of over 20,000 people in Cincinnati, filled up an arena. <APPLAUSE> And the media won't even talk about the size of the crowd, the enthusiasm of the crowd. I watched NBC this morning, they said, last night Donald Trump was in Cincinnati. If Hillary Clinton has 800 people, the crowd is so big. <LAUGHTER> It is horrible -- it is really horrible. The corrupt media is trying to do everything in their power to stop our movement. Believe me, they don't want this happening. We have one of the great movements -- we have the great movement. We have a movement that's never happened before.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And no paper is more corrupt than the failing New York Times. The good news is it is failing, it won't be around too much longer. But they are really, really bad people. The largest shareholder in the Times is Carlos Slim. Now Carlos Slim, as you know, comes from Mexico. He's given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiatives. So Carlos Slim, largest owner of the paper, from Mexico. Reporters at the New York Times, they're not journalists, they're corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton. We're going to let foreign corporations and their CEO's decide the outcomes of the -- you just can't do this. We can't let this happen. We are not going to let it happen where they decide the outcome of our elections. They can't do it and we're not going to let it happen. This is our last chance to save our country and reclaim it for we the people, and it's going to happen. <APPLAUSE> Oh, it's going to happen. As you have seen, right now I am being viciously attacked with lies and smears. <BOOING> It's a phony deal. I have no idea who these women are, have no idea. I have no idea. And I think you all know I have no idea because you understand me for a lot of years, OK? <APPLAUSE> When you looked at that horrible woman last night, you said I don't think so. I don't think so. <APPLAUSE> Whoever she is, wherever she comes from, the stories are total fiction. They're 100 percent made up, they never happened, they never would happen. I don't think they'd happen with very many people but they certainly aren't going to happen with me. Folks, you know my people always say, oh don't talk about it, talk about jobs, talk about the economy. Don't worry, your jobs are going to be coming back to North Carolina like you've seen, the economy's going to be good. <APPLAUSE> But I feel I have to talk about them because you have to dispute when somebody says something. And fortunately we have the microphone, we're able to dispute, some people can't. These are lies being pushed by the media and the Clinton campaign to try and keep their grip on our country. They are all false, they're totally invented, fiction. All 100 percent totally and completely fabricated. Never met this person, these people, I don't know who they are. I don't know who they -- think of what's happening to our country. Think of what's happening. I don't know who these people are, I look on television, I think it's a disgusting thing and it's being pushed. They have no witnesses, there's nobody around. They just come out. Some are doing it for probably a little fame, they get some free fame. It's a total setup. Now suddenly after many, many years, phony accusers come out less than a month before one of the most important elections in the history of our country. It also comes at a time as WikiLeaks unveils horrible, horrible things about Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> But they'd rather talk about this. Somebody that you've never seen that said, oh, 1992 he went like this. <LAUGHTER> One came out recently where I was sitting alone in some club. I really don't sit alone that much. Honestly, folks I don't think I sit alone. I go in with groups of people -- I was sitting alone by myself, like this.<LAUGHTER>
<TRUMP:> And then I went whaw. <LAUGHTER> To somebody. I just heard this one. It's like, it's like unbelievable. Even a simple investigation would've shown these allegations against me, in just about all cases, it's nonsense, it's false. And eyewitnesses already debunked to a People Magazine story. Here's my question about the dishonest writer from People Magazine. Why didn't she write what she said happened before we wrote the story, why didn't she put it in the story? The story would've been one of the big stories. I was the big star of the Apprentice, why didn't she go it 12 years ago? Twelve years ago. She's writing a story -- no think of this. Think of this. She's right, she's a liar. She is a liar. She's writing a story -- check our her Facebook page, you'll understand. Hey, she's writing a story about a beautiful love story, Melania, Donald, and she said I made inappropriate move. Now, just so you understand. That's a big story. If I did. She wrote the most beautiful story, honestly the most beautiful story, 100 percent story, like beautiful. Why wouldn't she have put this into the story? Now, two nights ago I get a call. Oh, People Magazine's doing a story. It's OK. No, no, it's not OK, it's about a story that was written 12 years ago. She was on last night, or one of the top people that People was on, and he said, no, we were just informed of it. Well, did you hear about it 12 years ago? Did you hear about five years? No, no, we never -- we just heard about it recently. These people are sick. These people are sick. And the reason she didn't write it 12 years ago is very simple. It never happened, it never happened. It's a lie. <APPLAUSE> It's a lie. And let me tell you, if it did happen, if it did happen, it -- 100 percent she would have written it, it would have been the biggest story of the year, OK? These are all horrible lies, all fabrications and we can't let them change the most important election in our lifetimes. If five percent of the people think it's true and maybe 10 percent think -- we don't win. In other words, they make lies. They have people come around, oh Donald Trump did this or that. I never saw these people before, I don't know who they are. And then you watch these phony networks, and dishonest networks, who are 100 percent -- let me tell you something about Hillary Clinton. She's got nothing going, she's got nothing. The only thing she's got going is the media. She's got nothing going. She's got nothing. The other day at the debate, where by the way, I absolutely destroyed her, OK? <APPLAUSE> Every online poll, even Time Magazine, Time Magazine is not exactly in love with me but every online poll had us skill <ph> -- she said, the other day I'm standing, I told you this. But I'm standing at my podium and she walks in front of me, right? She walks in front of me, you know? And when she walked in front of me, believe me I wasn't impressed. But she walks in front of me and she takes a question, then she walked back, and that was the end of that, no problem.
<TRUMP:> Then she said the next day, I invaded her space. Give me a break. And I was waiting for that because she had that incident once before where they made up something. Some guy invaded her space, the poor guy lost the election because of it. But I was very conscious of this so I purposely, I purposely didn't do anything. So -- get this guy out of here. Get him out of here, out. <APPLAUSE> Get out of here. <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> It's really total disrespect for the American flag. There he is. Look, good. Great. Folks -- folks, that's what's happening to our country, that's what's happening. That is total disrespect for our flag, that's what's happening to our country. We're going to turn it around, folks -- we're going to turn it around. <APPLAUSE> So -- so, just to finish up -- so just to finish up, you see what's happening. The process is rigged. This whole election is being rigged. These lies, spread by the media, without witnesses, without backup or anything else <inaudible> body makes an accusation that you did something, and you weren't -- you never saw this person before. It's a lie, total lie, it's fabrication. Sometimes they do it for fame, maybe they get money, who knows? The Clinton campaign is pushing it. The New York Times did a story on somebody where it was totally false. They knew it was totally false. We gave them the information, they wrote a whole big page about somebody where they were sending me e-mails, and letters, and everything, and then you realize -- it was a one-way send, by the way, there was nothing sent back -- and you realize it was a totally phony deal. They did a whole big story on it. They didn't mention all of the e-mails, they didn't mention everything coming my way. And others looked at it and, as bad as it was, soon as they saw this stuff that was said, they immediately -- immediately decided not to do this. The New York Times did a story on it. They read these stories and people might not know how untrue they are. It's really a disgrace. I've been saying this for a long time. The whole thing we've been going through, and I hate to say it but, the whole thing we're going through -- Bernie Sanders was a rigged deal -- the whole thing is one big fix, it's one big fix. It's one big ugly lie, it's one big fix. The press can't write the kind of things they write, which are lies, lies, lies. The stories are fabrications and false. And the only thing I say is hopefully, hopefully, our patriotic movement will overcome this terrible deception.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Hopefully, our great movement -- and there's never been anything like this in the United States. And the only way they figure they can throw it down is to come up with people that are willing to say, I was with Donald Trump in 1980. I was sitting with him on an airplane, and he went after me on the plane. Yeah, I'm going to go after. <LAUGHTER> Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you. Man. <LAUGHTER> You don't know, that would not be my first choice. Hopefully our great movement powered by everyday citizens will overcome the sickness that is plaguing our politics and our media. And I'll tell you what, our media is indeed sick and its making our country sick, and we're going to stop it. <APPLAUSE> We're going to stop it folks. All right, let's get on now, let's get onto another subject. But isn't it good that we talk about this? Right? Who thinks I shouldn't talk, we're talk jocks <ph>, right? Who thinks that I shouldn't talk about it? Does anybody think that? OK, I agree. When somebody, you know, a long time ago - when you get hit, you hit back, you've got to do it. You don't just say ""I didn't get hit, oh I didn't get hit."" When you get hit, we are destroying our country with these sick people back there, and they know it better than anybody in this arena. <BOOING> I ran because I knew what trouble our country was in. The country is in tremendous trouble, you know this. You know this in North Carolina, because you see what's happening to your jobs, they're disappearing. I know it's not about me, it's about you, and that's why I'm doing this. I didn't need to do this, but it's about you. It's about bringing our country, making our country great again. I'm taking these slings and arrows for you, so we can have our borders, so we can get back our jobs... <APPLAUSE> ...so we can be a safe nation again. You know, the murder - the number of murders in our country this year, went up more than they have in 45 years.
<UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIKE)>
<TRUMP:> It's true <ph>. Look, Obama is an incompetent. He is an incompetent president. <APPLAUSE> He doesn't know what he's doing, he's out campaigning all day long, he talking about me like he knows me. I don't know him, he doesn't know me. <APPLAUSE> And why doesn't some woman maybe come up and say what they say falsely about me, they could say about him. They could say it about anybody, they could say it about anybody. I'll tell you what, he better be careful, because they could say it about anybody, anybody at all. But Obama is in incompetent, as a president, he's about as bad as it gets. Look at what's happening, how Iran is taunting us. Look at what's going on, look at the world. He gives away $400 million in cash, but it turns out to $1.7 billion in cash. Gives them $150 billion... <BOOING> This guys doesn't know what he's doing, it's an embarrassment. If you look at the Middle East, it's a blow up, it's a total disaster. We have an incompetent president. I hate to say it, but it 100 percent true. And all he's doing, instead of working on your jobs and your companies leaving for Mexico and other places, he's campaigning for crooked Hillary. That's all he does. <BOOING> Either we win this election or we're going to lose our country, because 4 more years of Obama, you can't take it.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> WikiLeaks documents, Hillary Clinton speaking in secret - oh man, you saw those too <ph>, a secret Brazilian bank. Hillary Clinton said ""my dream is a hemisphere common market with open trade and open borders."" There go the rest of your jobs - <BOOING> There go <ph> - even though she doesn't say that, but that's what she said in a very, very secret meeting. The e-mails show that behind closed doors speaking to these international bankers, Hillary Clinton's pledged to destroy the sovereignty of the United States. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders than you've ever <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> And yes, we will build a wall. <APPLAUSE> Crooked Hillary also wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees to pour into our country <ph>. <BOOING> And that's <inaudible> Obama numbers and those are thousands and thousands <inaudible>. This - even though she admitted it private, according to WikiLeaks, again, nobody is covering WikiLeaks. They're covering somebody that I never saw before, that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrate the refugee program. So you have terrorists coming in, she knows they're coming in, and yet she wants to increase it. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> And our country will never be the same. So let me state this as clearly as I can. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> At the same time, we're going to take care of our military and we're going to take care of our great, great, great veterans. <APPLAUSE> They've been treated very badly. <APPLAUSE> That includes - veterans' choice so veterans can either attend a public V.A. facility or if they have to wait online like they've been doing, sometimes for as much as seven days and then still not get proper care, they'll go to a private medical center or they'll go to a private or public or something, they will go outside... <APPLAUSE> ...they'll go to a private doctor, they'll go to a private hospital, they'll go to a public hospital. We're going to get them care and we're going to pay for their - that care. They're not going to wait online <ph>. For seven days and die sometimes waiting online for a simple, simple procedure or prescription. It's not going to happen like that any longer for our veterans, OK? Not going to happen. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary Clinton said, no, no, the V.A. is doing a good job, OK? <BOOING> North Carolina is home to more than 100,000 active-duty military personnel and almost 800,00 veterans. <APPLAUSE> The military supports over half a million jobs in this state. We are going to repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and we are going to rebuild the military of the United States which is very, sadly, depleted.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> When it comes to keeping America safe, I believe in a three and - I think you believe in these words, I think - three very important words, peace through strength, right. Peace through strength. <APPLAUSE> And we don't want to use our strength, but you have to have our strength. And the world is laughing at us. They're laughing at the stupidity of our President. Remember he drew the line in the sand -- the line is in the sand. Remember Hillary the last debate? I wasn't Secretary of State then. She doesn't even know. It turned out she lied. Remember she said TPP was gold standard, she said she never said that during the debate. She lied about that. She's a liar. <APPLAUSE> But to be a strong country, we must also be a very rich country. At the center of our economic revival we'll be fixing our really horrendous, one-way street, horrible trade deals. We're going to fix them folks. You know, last year we lost almost $800 billion in trade deficits. We have trade deficit with other nations of almost $800 billion. And I have some friends in the audience, I guarantee I can take any one of those friends - one in particular who happens to be brutal but that's OK, lives in North Carolina, so you know, one of those things, right, but a great business person. I put him in charge - this case him - we would have such a good thing. And there are people like that. We have the greatest negotiators in the world, we have the greatest business people in the world, we don't use them. We use political hacks. So we have a trade deficit of almost $800 billion. Sad, isn't it? Isn't it pathetic? North Carolina's industrial <ph> workers have been crushed by Bill Clinton's signing of NAFTA supported by crooked Hillary. Don't forget, a lot of people want that to happen because they make a lot of money by taking money out of this country. Those deals are very good for a lot of people. A lot of people know - everybody knows that NAFTA is no good for the United States, but it's good for their wallets in some cases. You've lost nearly half of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, did you know that? You've lost almost half of your manufacturing jobs. This region used to be the furniture manufacturing hub of the world. I know because I bought plenty. But the NAFTA deal and then China's entry into the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed disaster, have sent those jobs to other countries. You know better than anybody. I used to be here a lot for furniture, gets smaller and smaller every year. Not going to have anything left pretty soon. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Our jobs have been stolen from us and we have people that don't know what they are doing, in particular our leadership. If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. <APPLAUSE> If we don't get the deal we want, we leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better, a much more fair deal because right now, we're a one-way highway into Mexico, a one-way highway <ph>.
<TRUMP:> I mean, you take a look at this, it's one way. They get the jobs, they get the factories, they get the cash, and all we get - we get illegal immigration and we get drugs. And the drugs are poisoning our youth, the drugs are poisoning our youth and others. But we're getting the drugs and we're getting lots of problems. And I'll tell you, I was endorsed by the, as you know, by ICE just last week, and by the border patrol agents. <APPLAUSE> Sixteen thousand five hundred Border Patrol. They've never -- they've never done this before. They've never done -- they've never endorsed a presidential candidate. Both groups endorsed me. Because we're going to have strong borders. And we're going to have people come into our country, but they're going to come in legally, legally. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to stand up to China, we're going to stop their currency manipulation and product dumping, which is killing us. And they don't follow the rules and, if they don't, we're going to institute tariffs. When they send something into our country -- and, believe me, they're going to obey our rules so quickly, you have no idea. And we'll end up with a better relationship with China than we do now. Look what they're doing, they're building a massive fortress against everything. A massive fortress in the South China Sea. And yet they're ripping us off. Now, if they're going to rip us off, you wouldn't think they'd be building fortresses. They have no respect for our President -- which I can understand that -- they have no respect for Obama, they have no respect for our country, and they're getting away with murder. And we have the cards, we have the cards. We have all the cards. Because we're like the piggy bank that everybody keeps stealing from. But pretty soon we're not going to be piggy bank anymore. We're going to be the opposite of the piggy bank. <APPLAUSE> We don't have -- we are $20 trillion, half of which came during the Obama years. And yet we didn't fix anything. Our roads are bad, our bridges are bad, our tunnels are bad, our schools are bad, our hospitals are bad. We're going to start making things again in America. As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 tax, the biggest since Ronald Reagan. <APPLAUSE> Wages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing, rushing back in to our country. We're also going to fix our inner cities. Forty-five percent of African-American children are -- under the age six -- are living in poverty. Think of it, 45 percent. Fifty-eight percent of African- American youth don't have jobs. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. Three thousand people since January, three thousand. It's like a war zone. Violent crime in Greensboro increased by 25 percent last year. Did you know that? Twenty-five percent. To those African-Americans suffering in our country, I say, what do you have to lose? Vote for Trump, I'm going to fix it. What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? <APPLAUSE> I will fight harder for you than anyone has fought for you before. Here are some of the more amazing things we're going to do when we take over, hopefully, this incredible country and run it properly in 2017. We going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, we're going to eliminate job-killing regulations which are a disaster, we are going to defend religious liberty. <APPLAUSE> We're going to end Common Core. Going to bring our education local. We're going to support the men and women of law enforcement, repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> We are going to save our Second Amendment.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We're going to appoint great justices to the United States Supreme Court to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> So you have 25 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true. But to beat the system, you have to pound the pavement, get your friends and co-workers out, organize your neighbors and fight for the country you want. <APPLAUSE> On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, it's time, all right? <APPLAUSE> I am asking all Americans, Republicans, Independents and Democrats, to join us in our campaign to defeat the corrupt establishment and give our government back to the people. It's going to happen. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to fight for every citizen of every background. Thank you.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. So we're going to fight and we're going to fight for every stretch of this nation. And I'm going to fight to bring us all together, we're a divided nation. Very divided nation right now. We're going to be unified nation, a nation of love. <APPLAUSE> Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag. <APPLAUSE> You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, and we're having a good time. We're having a good time. <APPLAUSE> You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like nobody's ever seen in this country before. Even our enemies admit that. We're going to make history together, you're going to look back at the election, on November 8th, and you're going to say it is the most important vote you've ever cast because that's when our country started working again. That's when our country -- <APPLAUSE> -- became safe again. That's when our country became strong again and rich again. And we will make America, just like your beautiful hat, we will make America great again. Thank you, thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you everybody. God bless you, go out and vote November 8th.","The Grammar Lab"

The incredible spirit of the people of this state will power its recovery and the same spirit that will rebuild our nation. You know, that's happening right now. There's a movement going on the likes of which nobody has seen ever in this country. And we're going to bring it forth and we're going to be very happy and very proud of our country again. I will tell you that. <APPLAUSE> We're going to renegotiate our very disastrous trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees. <APPLAUSE> Take care of our incredible veterans who are not being taken care of properly. <APPLAUSE> We're going to repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare quickly. <APPLAUSE> Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration. So many have left. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> Your taxes will go way down. And crooked Hillary is giving you a big tax increase. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump administration. Your companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump administration. There will be consequences. <APPLAUSE> They're not going to be leaving so easy folks, not like the old days. The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake come November 8th. Such an important day. <APPLAUSE> Such an important day. Get out and vote, everybody. Get out and vote. <APPLAUSE> In an e-mail sent to John Podesta on August 17, 2014, Hillary wrote that the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia are quote, ""providing clandestine, financial and logistical support to ISIL"". Yet, in that same year, Bill and Hillary accepted a check from Saudi Arabia. So Hillary thinks that they are funding ISIS, but still takes their money. And you know their views on gays and you know their views on women. Takes a lot of money. I think she should give back the $25 million to $35 million she's taken from Saudi Arabia. And she should give it back fast. <APPLAUSE> There's a lot of people in here. <APPLAUSE> You're a big group. This is a big group. <APPLAUSE> You know, I own an big development right down the road, Trump National, right on Lake Norman. Lake Norman. And we have an amazing -- it's an amazing success. We have amazing people there. Both the employees and the people living there and we love it.
<AUDIENCE: We love you!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Clinton corruption. Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after receiving, after. Remember the word after receiving, a congressional subpoena and then made 13 phones disappear.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> It's amazing what she's getting away with, right? It's amazing. But maybe that won't happen. She made 13 phones disappear. Some by beating them, beating them, beating with a hammer. Has anybody, when you got rid of your iPhone, knocked the hell out of it with a hammer? <LAUGHTER>
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> There's a person way, way in the back. We will find out what business that person's in. <LAUGHTER> She did it to cover up her crimes. It's one more reason why we need a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> And we have to investigate the investigation. The investigation, nobody in this country has seen anything like it. This is our last chance to save our country and reclaim it for we the people. This is it. You don't have another chance. I really believe this is it. As you have seen, I am a victim of one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country. <BOOING> They are coming after me to try and destroy, what is considered by even them, the greatest movement in the history of our country. There's never been anything like this. <APPLAUSE> Bill O'Reilly and others have said it's the single greatest political phenomena in his lifetime and others have said the same thing. The political establishment is trying to stop us because they know we are a threat to their totally corrupt control. It's true. <APPLAUSE> No one is more corrupt than crooked Hillary Clinton. Nobody. <APPLAUSE> In fact, she's the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States of America. <APPLAUSE> And her specialty, if you look over the years, has been character assassination and really personally just going after people. That's her specialty. She's been doing it her whole career. The only force strong enough to smash Clinton's corrupt criminal syndicate is you, the American voter. November 8th. November 8th. <APPLAUSE> After many, many years, even many decades, without complaint, the media and the Clinton campaign have brought forward false allegations less than a month before the most important election in modern times. <BOOING> These allegations are 100 percent false. As everybody -- I think you know. I think you get it. I think you get it. They're made up. They never happened. When have you met tens of thousands of people, as I have. And I've met thousands and thousands and thousands of people, know them, know them well. It's not hard to find a small handful of people willing to make false smears for personal fame. Who knows? Maybe for financial reasons, political purposes or for the simple reason they want to stop our movement. They want to stop our campaign. Very simple. <BOOING> These claims defy reason, truth, logic, common sense. They're made without supporting witnesses. No witnesses. Hey, you know, 28 years ago, 10 years ago, 14 years ago, 12 years ago, not me. Believe me. Not me. Not me. You would be very impressed actually with my life in so many regards, including that regard. No. Not a single shred of evidence. Eyewitnesses have already debunked the wild and ludicrous allegations of a magazine article that appeared. And I'll tell you what, it was just incredible. It was People Magazine and the article appeared. And a statement was made. But if it were true, they would have put it in the article. They would have had to put it into the article. But they didn't do that, and they didn't do that for a simple reason; because it never happened, 12 years ago. Never complained, never talked to the bosses, never, all of a sudden two nights ago we get a call. And the call is from People Magazine. They didn't even want a quote. I think maybe what we should do, boycott that issue of People Magazine. <APPLAUSE> So, that's the way it is. But I just want to tell you folks that it is a campaign that's amazing. And I'm not going to be talking about it much, because we want to talk about other things and we have to talk about other things. But if it affects five percent or two percent or 10 percent or it's all false stuff. It's all a concerted effort. And I think it's the only way they're going to stop us, the only way. And I don't think that's going to happen. <BOOING> Yes, you can get him <ph> out of here. Get them out. Get them out. <BOOING> Hey look, the great thing, the cameras turned. <APPLAUSE> Look. The cameras turned. The cameras turned. Oh, that's wonderful. That's so good. It's the only way we get the cameras to turn. So folks, here's the story. We are going to bring jobs back to North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> We are going to bring borders back to our country. And yes, we will build a wall. <APPLAUSE> And Mexico will be paying for that wall. <APPLAUSE> Great crowd, I'll tell you.
<AUDIENCE: Build a wall! Build a wall! Build a wall! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> This is a great crowd. But I want to talk about jobs because I know this part of the world, I told you I have property here. A lot of great employees, a lot of great people, a lot of friends. And your jobs are being taken pretty much like nobody else's jobs have been taken. And it's only going to get worse. And as you stand here tonight, some of your companies, your leaders in your companies, are negotiating with Mexico and other places. You know that. <APPLAUSE> To move that company to Mexico. And during the primary system, I had a very, very interesting period of time because I got to know this country so well. We had 17 people running. I was given a small chance because they said he's not an experienced politician. And then week after week, one by one, right? Right? Boom. Boom. Boom. But I got to know the country and I got to see what's happening with our manufacturing. We don't make much anymore by comparison to what we used to do. We used to be amazing. We don't do what we used to do. And I had won New York State and I had gotten up to places in New York State, which I hadn't seen for a long time. Hillary Clinton represented New York State and she was a disaster. She was a disaster. <BOOING> She said she was going to bring jobs back, 200,000 jobs. Well, it was just the opposite; jobs fled. She lied to the people of New York State. It was a total catastrophe. And if you look at what's happened to New York now, you just take a look at what's happened to New York in terms of upstate and manufacturing, you go to the different places, Albany and Syracuse and Rome. I always say that's the real Rome. But unfortunately, they're having a lot of problems. And you'll see what happens. But I went -- I went, oh that's an oops. Somebody's hurt. Is there a doctor in the house please? Doctor in the house? We have to take care of our people, right? These are great people. Have to take care of our people. <APPLAUSE> And we have to take care of our country because we don't want to be a divided country anymore. We're very divided and we're going to take care of our country. Some of these people got here nine hours and 10 hours ago, right? Right? Some of these people. <APPLAUSE> So we can understand how there can be some problems. <APPLAUSE> Are you doing OK over there? Look OK? We have tough people in this room, let me tell you. It's hot. It's hot. <APPLAUSE> The other night, they said, Donald Trump was sweating. I was in a room that was 110 degrees. We had 17,000 people. And I'll tell you what, wasn't sweating too much for what we had. Good. We'll make sure everything's perfect here, all right? We'll make sure everything's perfect. You take your time. Our great police have just arrived. Do we love our police. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Everything good? All right, I'm getting the hi <ph> sign. Good. Good, give that person a hand. <APPLAUSE> You know, when they go down at a Trump rally, they leave and they always come back. It's an amazing thing. It's an amazing thing. All right? So we'll keep going. You let us know if there's any problem and I'll come down and help you myself. All right? <APPLAUSE> So we went to Indiana, and in going to Indiana, I got to know the great Bobby Knight. That was a great endorsement, Coach Knight. You know that story he called, he said, ""Mr. Trump this Coach Knight, I want you to run for president."" I said, Coach, I haven't made up my mind. This was a couple of years ago. He said, ""Well, if you do I'd like to endorse you. You just let me know."" And we were winning state after state, after state. And all of a sudden, we hit Indiana. And that's where we were going to maybe not do as well. Remember that? They called it our watershed. And I said, you know Bobby Knight called, and a friend of mine said, you know, have you ever had any access to Bobby Knight, that would be great. I said, I just happened to. And I lifted up this huge pile of papers and I wrote his number down. I put it right there. And it was right there. It was like a miracle. It was from God, right? It was from God. <APPLAUSE> And that says Jesus for Trump. You're right. <APPLAUSE> And... <APPLAUSE> And I said, you know what, let me do that. I called Bobby Knight. He said, ""I'd love to be there."" I want to tell you, that was a very, very strong performance that he put in and we put in. And then we went and run <ph>. But I really got to know our country, and I got to know it well. And I'm so proud of the people of this country. And one of the things I saw, and I say <ph> -- you take care of that person. Good. Thank you. Thank you, darling. <APPLAUSE> She'll be back. You watch. She'll right back. But one of the things that happened is I saw what was going on so closely and so vividly with respect to jobs and how our jobs are being drained because of NAFTA. NAFTA is a disaster. It's a disaster signed by Bill Clinton. <BOOING> You're not going to believe the number; 70,000 -- 70,000 factories, manufacturing plants have closed since the signing of NAFTA. Who would believe this? Who would believe it? Seventy -- I thought they made a mistake. I thought it would be 700. I said, it can't be 70,000. Millions of jobs wasted, lost. Many people in this room are making less money now than they made 20 years ago, 18 years ago, 25 years ago in real wages. And they're working harder. So am I, so I don't feel so guilty about that. This is work. But not bad work. This is good work because we're getting to a position where if we can win North Carolina -- and we're leading in Ohio, you saw that. <APPLAUSE> And we're doing great in Florida. Doing great. <APPLAUSE> We are doing so good in Florida. By the way, these teleprompters haven't been working for the last 20 minutes. <LAUGHTER> And I actually like my speech better without teleprompters. <APPLAUSE> And this way, what I like about it, wait a minute. Let me see how these things... <APPLAUSE> You know what, I like it better without the teleprompters. <APPLAUSE> And I notice, every time I look up, they're trying, it's trying, it's straining. It's straining. Hey, get this thing out of here, will you? Get it out. <APPLAUSE> I like it much better without the teleprompter. You know, it's very funny. I went through 17 professional politicians, top people, and I went without any teleprompters. Then all of a sudden they said, well now you're running in the election. You need teleprompters. And I like teleprompters. They're fine, but it's sort of cooler without it right?
<AUDIENCE: Yeah! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Don't you think? I like it better without. It's a little strange when you see this <inaudible>. I watch Hillary. She's got the biggest pieces of glass and sometimes they're painted black on the other side because you see better. And she always just reads off the teleprompter. And it's short and then she goes home and she goes to sleep. <LAUGHTER> Now she's not -- look, look. She's not -- she's not going to campaign anymore until after because she's prepping for the debate. Now, the last time she prepped for a week also. And let's face it, you have to say, I really beat her easily. That was an easy... <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> So here's the story. Here's the way I work, here's the way government works. So the teleprompter's a bummer. It doesn't work. That means the company doing the teleprompter is in the back. That means they didn't do a good job. So, I won't pay them. Right? I won't pay them. <APPLAUSE> And tomorrow, I'll have a story in the newspaper, Donald Trump did not pay a contractor who put up the teleprompters. Well, why should I? They don't work. <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> And -- oh, it's true. It's true. <APPLAUSE> And they'll make me like a bad guy, like I'm a bad person. Right? You know, I don't pay -- I pay contractors on time. I am so good. We just built a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, the old Post Office. On time, under budget, I paid -- we had great contractors. Right? But when you have a bum contractor -- now, here's the thing. You have a bad contractor, don't pay or cut the price. You have a good contractor, get that money out fast. But the -- the country should do the same thing. They build roads. They build roads that cost much more than they're supposed to cost, right? They build roads that are crazy, where they're double and triple. They build buildings where they every see a 1,000 percent. There's a hospital being built in one of my favorites states. It's so out of control. It's like 1,000 percent. It's a V.A. hospital. A thousand percent cost overrun. I looked at it. I figured it was this massive -- it's not even a big deal. It's not even a big deal. Our country has to be able to do things on time, on budget. Has to be able to build on time, on budget. Has to be able to purchase its military equipment not for political reasons because some political guy owns the company, but because that's the equipment that our generals, our admirals and our soldiers and sailors want. <APPLAUSE> Have to do it. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to change our whole purchasing procedure. For instance, the purchase of drugs. The drug companies have a tremendously powerful lobby. We don't negotiate properly. We would save so much money with proper negotiation. And it is true about the military. If you are somebody that has less good stuff that they don't want as much as another company but you are a political power, you contribute to the senators and to the congressmen and to the people that make the decisions and you work with the admirals and you work with everybody, all of a sudden they're buying equipment that's not as good and they're spending more money doing it. We're not going to be doing that stuff anymore. Remember this, I'll have spent over $100 million of my money running for office. And some of these people said -- and they say it all the time. They said -- one in particular said, you don't realize what you've done. Never been done before. You don't realize. It doesn't matter whether or not you win or lose. It makes no difference, what you've done for political history. I said, let me tell you a little secret. <APPLAUSE> If we don't win on November 8th, it will be the greatest waste of time, energy -- energy. You ever heard that word before energy? You ever heard the word low energy? He didn't sign -- you know, he signed that pledge. But a couple of those guys that signed the pledge, you know they signed the pledge because they wanted me to sign the pledge. And then when they lost, they never got beaten so badly in their lives, folks. But when they lost, they didn't honor the pledge that they signed. I was actually surprised. Only a few of them, only a few of them, most of them did. Many of them, Ben Carson and a lot of great people. A lot of great people. <APPLAUSE> Mike Huckabee's been great. Chris Christie. <APPLAUSE> We've had a lot of great support. We've had a lot of great -- especially from the real world. A couple of our leaders aren't -- you know, it's not working out for them so well. But I will tell you this, we are going to have -- we are going to have an amazing victory on November 8th. We're going to come back here and celebrate. But we're going to have an amazing victory because this is all about the people. This is now about the people. So, let me just tell you, I was talking about jobs. And when you get... <APPLAUSE> I feel the same way. When you get --- when you get to the different places within our country and you see how our companies are being sucked out into Mexico and other places, here's what's going to happen. I go to Indiana and I see Carrier Air Conditioning; 1,400 people that followed me all over Indiana, so many of them. So much support. They were fired. They were there for some of them 25 years longer, they were fired. Carrier announced that they're moving to Mexico. They're going to build a brand new plant. And they're going to make air conditioners... <BOOING> And they're going to sell the air conditioners into our country and other places. And we are fools, so we're just going to say, oh go ahead. You fire all these people in Indianapolis. And you're going to do this. Not if I'm president. All right? <APPLAUSE> Ford -- Ford announced two weeks ago that they're moving the production of their smaller cars -- that's a big production -- to Mexico from our country. And by the way, the reason we're doing well in Michigan and in Ohio is because they know that I've been talking about automobile production and I've been pointing out what's happening to automobile production and where's it's moving and I've been talking about it for five years. Crooked Hillary just started talking about it. And let me tell you, just like she failed in New York State with jobs, she's never bringing your businesses back, folks. She's never bringing your businesses back. And she's going to give you massive tax increases. Massive. And I'm cutting taxes massively. So, here's the story. For years and years, you've been hearing that companies are moving out. Who better than North Carolina to know exactly what happened, right? You people have lost a lot of businesses. Not going to happen anymore. <APPLAUSE> So, whether it's Ford, whether it's Carrier, whether it's somebody else, we hear somebody's leaving, we're going to say, we hope you stay. And let's stay and let's talk. Nobody talks to these companies, by the way. Do you think anybody talked from the federal government to Carrier or to Ford? Or -- they just do whatever they want to do. But nobody talks. You've got to go see them. You've got <inaudible>, you've got to be nice. And if it doesn't work out, you'll tax the hell out of their product coming back here. <APPLAUSE> True. <APPLAUSE> So -- so what happened -- what happens is for years -- for years and years -- that's right. For years and years they've been talking about how do we keep our companies in North Carolina? How do we keep our countries in these different states? And they give interest-free loans and they give all sorts of goodies. That's -- they didn't need the money. They want to leave, they didn't need the money. So I've been talking for the last six months, I said, it's very simple. I mean, I do it before even -- before I said a sentence. What you do is you say the following. Carrier are you staying or are you leaving? Well, we're leaving. By the way, nobody's going to leave once you tell them what's happening. Nobody's leaving. So they're leaving because they're a little early. And you say to them though, assuming -- as an example, if I were made by a president, secretary of keeping businesses in the United States, OK? <APPLAUSE> I'll be -- instead of secretary of State, secretary of keeping businesses -- not a very glamorous title, but boy would I be good at that. <APPLAUSE> Because I would call up the head of Carrier, as an example, and I would say congratulations on your new plant in Mexico. Yes, I agree it's warm, but I hear it's going to be a lovely place. And if you move, and we don't want you to move, there are consequences. They'll say, what are the consequences? I'll say, every single time you make an air conditioning unit in Mexico and you think after firing all of these people in Indianapolis you're going to take that unit, have it come across the border with no tariffs, no taxes, you're 100 percent wrong. We're going to charge you... <APPLAUSE> We're going to charge you -- very importantly, we're going to charge you a 35 percent tax for any unit that you <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> Now, here's what's going to happen. Number one, very strongly, nobody's going to leave. But if they do leave, you know, one percent, two percent, believe me nobody's leaving. If I'm that secretary, nobody's leaving. But if they do leave, we're going to make a fortune. So it's OK either way. Right? Ladies? Right? <APPLAUSE> Because we cannot afford to continue to lose our companies. We're losing our companies. We're losing our jobs. We cannot afford to lose our jobs. We cannot afford to lose our manufacturing. So it's going to all come to an end. It's going to all come to an end. We are going to keep our companies. We are going to expand our companies. We are reducing taxes, the biggest tax decrease since Ronald Reagan and could even be bigger than that. <APPLAUSE> Our companies are going to stay. Our companies are going to expand. And our companies are going to thrive. In addition, new companies will be started and new jobs will happen. And we will produce 25 million jobs over a period of 10 years as sure as you're standing there. And I'd give you seats, but there were too many people. Sorry. <APPLAUSE> So, whether it's Carrier -- yes.
<AUDIENCE: (OFF-MIKE)>
<TRUMP:> Oh, is that Carrier Air Conditioning? What's he talking about? <APPLAUSE> Oh you don't have the speaker?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> I'll tell you, whoever runs this place is not doing very well. You don't have the speaker. They said -- do you hear me over there? Great job, fellows. So now we don't have to pay for this and now we don't have to pay for that. <APPLAUSE> Man. <APPLAUSE> Who the hell runs this place? <LAUGHTER> They say the speakers don't work. And I was having so much fun without these damn teleprompters, right? But an you hear me OK? Can you hear me over there?
<AUDIENCE: Yeah!>
<TRUMP:> All right. You're good enough. See there, I wouldn't deduct full, but I'll take 30 percent off the cost for the country <ph>. <APPLAUSE> So we'll keep our jobs. We'll thrive. We're going to thrive. We're not going to give Iran -- we're not going to give them $400 million in cash that turned out to be $1.7 billion. Do you believe that? <BOOING> Do you believe that? $1.7 billion in cash. We're giving them $150 billion and now look at what's going on. We've embolden them. Instead of making them our friends, this incompetent president. He's incompetent. We've emboldened -- I mean, this guy, all I, all he does is campaign for crooked Hillary. <APPLAUSE> Look, he doesn't want Trump because Trump is going to be much different. First of all, one of my first acts is to get rid of his ridiculous healthcare that doesn't work. <APPLAUSE> I wonder who pays for that big plane when he flies into campaign for Hillary? <BOOING> I know the answer. You know what happens? The campaign pays for a tiny little fraction, a tiny little fraction. <APPLAUSE> Is that good or bad? Oh, they just got it working. All right, we'll give them 20 percent off. <LAUGHTER> Good. Sounds much better right? Good voice. Right? All right. Thank you, fellows. That's great. So, we are going to -- well, we have no choice -- repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> Now, you saw what happened. The governor of Minnesota came out, he said the Affordable Care Act is not affordable. It's a disaster. Hey folks, it is a disaster. Hillary Clinton wants to save it. She wants to spend a fortune. Your premiums are going to go up next year over 100 percent. This year, you look at Texas, you look at your area, you look at everywhere, they're going up 50, 60, 70, 80 percent. It is -- it's gone. It's busted. It's broken. It doesn't work. And I told you it didn't work before it was signed, right? Because I know this stuff. I'm pretty good at this stuff. It is a disaster. We're going to have a new healthcare plan that's going to cost much less money, both for you and for the country. <APPLAUSE> And it's going to be a much higher quality healthcare. Remember you can have your doctor, you can have your plan, 28 times. Right? Twenty-eight times he said it, 28 times. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton, when she was at the State Department, $6 billion was found to be missing. You saw that. Right? This is what we're going to have for our president. So here's the story. We are going to have a great, great vibrant country again. We're going to have jobs. We're going to have jobs. We're going to bring back in new jobs. But we're going to take care of things that have never been taken care of. You know what that is? The inner cities. We have.... <APPLAUSE> Inner cities, where the crime rate is beyond belief. The levels of poverty are hard to believe we're in this country. The education is virtually non-existent it's so bad. The -- Common Core, we're going to get rid of Common Core, believe me. <APPLAUSE> Common Core is out. We're going to bring education <inaudible>. But you take a look at the African-American folks living in the inner cities, where the crime is so bad you go with your child to get a loaf of bread and you get shot. It's so bad. The crime is out of control. Everything's out of control. You look at Chicago; 300 -- no 3,000 shootings -- 3,000 shootings since January 1st. The crime rate is incredible. Murders in the United States, nobody tells you this. These people don't tell you this. Murders in the United States -- murders in the United States are up 45, did you see the numbers? The highest -- the highest they've been -- the highest they've been in 45 years. Murder. So murder's the highest it's been in 45 years. We are going to make our country so much stronger, so much safer. And for the African-American community living in the hell of these inner cities, we're going to solve the crime problem. We're going to help with education. <APPLAUSE> We're going to bring our jobs back for everybody. We're going to make the communities safe. And you know, I've been saying this. What the hell do you have to lose? They're a disaster. The inner cities are a disaster. All over; Washington, D.C., Baltimore. You look at the crime statistics. I really say it, what do you have to lose? I will fix the inner cities. It's like a passion of mine. I'm good at fixing things, especially real estate. <APPLAUSE> And importantly, we're going to help big league with education. We're going to bring in choice, which is so important. And so important is we're going to bring jobs back to our country so the people actually have jobs. So, I say I hope you're going to vote for Donald Trump. Same things... <APPLAUSE> Same thing.... <APPLAUSE> Same thing with the Hispanic-Americans, is that a correct statement? How many Hispanic-Americans do we have here? One, we have at least one. We have a lot. Wow, that's good. <APPLAUSE> We're going to bring jobs back. We're going to bring education back. We're going to bring safety back. Vote for Trump, we're going to fix it. That I can tell you. Vote for Trump. <APPLAUSE> Vote for Trump. So, here's a list of things. We're going to fix our depleted military. <APPLAUSE> Our depleted military -- you look at where we are compared to where we used to be; number of ships, the kind of weaponry we have. You look at what's going on with the people we just made rich. Look at what's going on tonight. Just take a look at what's going on. We want to have peace through strength. We have to be stronger. We have to have better equipment. Our people in the military are the best. But they have old equipment. They have old fighter jets. They have fighter jets that are so old that they have to go to museums where they're on display. They have to go to plane graveyards because they don't make the parts anymore. These are our fighter jets that we're currently using. So we're going to fix our very, very depleted military so that our people in the military can have the kind of depth and the kind of equipment that they deserve. We're going to work with our veterans. Because our veterans, in many cases, are treated far worse than illegal immigrants coming in to the country. We're going to help our veterans. Big veteran state. We're going to help our veterans. And help them big league, and they know my plan. It's been posted. And I have tremendous veteran support. There's not going to be waiting online for nine days and seven days and six days. And people dying, people dying because they can't see a doctor quickly enough for a simple procedure or for a simple prescription. So we're going to fix that and you all know what we're doing. If you have that kind of a wait, you're going outside to a private doctor across the street or you're going to a private or public hospital. We'll pay the bill. But you're not going to be dying in our country, not our veterans. You're not going to be dying, waiting online for seven days, nine days and 10 days. <APPLAUSE> It's very important. We are going to stop drugs from pouring into our country. <APPLAUSE> ICE endorsed us just last week. The Border Patrol agents, 2,000 -- 16,500 and ICE. So we have ICE. We have Border Patrol. First time either one has ever endorsed an presidential candidate. <APPLAUSE> We are going to stop -- and I promised this to the people of New Hampshire because New Hampshire has a tremendous heroin problem. We are going to stop drugs from pouring in to our country and poisoning our youth. We're going to stop it. We're going to stop it. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to stop people from coming into our country illegally. But we are going to have a big beautiful door in our wall. And that door is going to let lots of people in, but they're coming into our country legally. <APPLAUSE> Coming in legally. <APPLAUSE> We're going to protect your Second Amendment, which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> The National Rifle Association endorsed Donald Trump, and it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to a candidate. So I'm proud of -- these are great people. These are great Americans and they are doing the right thing. So your Second Amendment under siege. If Hillary gets in, forget it. Forget it. We will protect your Second Amendment. Importantly -- importantly -- so importantly, I told you about Obamacare, forget it, it's gone. But so importantly, we are going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court that you will be proud of. <APPLAUSE> Constitution -- we're going to be upholding and respecting our Constitution. So, I just want to say this. When you look back, and we all had a good time, even though your speakers were no good, your teleprompters were no good. As long as Trump was good, that's all that matters. Right? <APPLAUSE> We had a good time. But you're going to look back at this evening. You're going to say, hey I had a good time. But you're going to go home and in 15 years and in 25 years, hopefully in longer than that, you're going to look back at this evening and say this was a very important evening in your life. <APPLAUSE> More importantly, I love those signs, women for Trump because I actually think I'm doing well with women. <APPLAUSE> Woah. <APPLAUSE> See, they may have the worst seats, but they're going to be the most famous people because look at those cameras. So, more importantly, you're going to view your vote on November 8th to be the most important vote that you've ever cast because we're going to take back the White House. We're going to... <APPLAUSE> ... have a country that you're going to be so proud of again. We're going to have a country that works. Do you notice we don't win anymore folks. When was the last time we won? We have Iran nipping at us. You look at what's going on. We can't beat ISIS. I always say, George Patton, I was a fan. Today, he couldn't make it because he wasn't politically correct. He was a little on the rough side. Right? He was boom, boom, boom. But George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur, these people are spinning in their graves right now. And for the military people, right? For the military people, the element of surprise, don't we like that? The element of surprise. So, I hear, who knows, but we hear in Mosul that a lot of the leaders of ISIS are in Mosul. Right? I've been hearing that for a while. And they think they're largely in Mosul. About three weeks ago, I started hearing that we, through Iraq, but we are going to attack Mosul. We're going to attack them sometime within the next few months. We're going to hit them hard. Left, right, back, forward. Yes, sir, we're going to attack them. There's only one problem, by the time we attack them all the guys that we want are going to be gone. They're very smart. How stupid are the people that run our country? <APPLAUSE> Why couldn't they keep it quiet? Why couldn't they keep it quiet, knock the hell out of them, grab them all and then announce a week later to the American people that we've gotten the bad ones. The bad ones are gone, folks. They're someplace else. We -- that's for the military people. They understand that better than anybody. Am I right? <APPLAUSE> Do you think General George Patton, if he were in charge -- and by the way, I have over 200 admirals and generals supporting Donald Trump and endorsing Donald Trump. <APPLAUSE> I have 21 recipients of the Medal of Honor that have endorsed Donald Trump. So they like my attitude. They like actually my knowledge. People were surprised the other night when we -- by the way, totally, totally annihilated in the debate. <APPLAUSE> Totally. Remember when she came in front of me. She walked right in front of me. I said, huh, Hi Hillary. But remember she walked in front of me, answered the question, which is fine, I have no problem with it. And then the next day, they put out something. I invaded her space while on the stage. I invaded. Did you see that, right? <BOOING> I'm standing, here's my lectern. No, no. Here's my lectern, and I'm standing there. And we're answering and this and that. And I was three to one. You know, I had Anderson Cooper and I had Martha Raddatz. I don't think she likes me too much. <BOOING> I don't think she likes me too much. <BOOING> No, but I had three to one. In fact, I said, what is this three to one? And Hillary came and she walked right in front of me. I was at my chair. I was at my lectern. I was standing there. The reason is, I didn't want to be scolded for that. And sure as hell, the next day, he violated Hillary's space or to put it another way, he violated the space of crooked Hillary. So anyway, but she's home now. She's prepping. So we'll see what happens. But when I saw this whole thing on Mosul. Day after day we're attacking Mosul. In two weeks, three weeks, there are <ph> not exactly, all they know is that it's happening. What the hell are we doing? What are we doing? So, we're going to have a country run smart. We won't be giving $150 billion to a terrorist state. We'll be looking at the deal so close, inside out and backwards. And if it's not, if they are not living up -- I mean, the hardest part for me is we've given them so much money already. I would have liked it much more before we gave them all that money. But they don't honor that deal to every single little line, every single little word, we're going to rip the sucker up so fast your head will spin. Their head will spin. <APPLAUSE> It's one of the most incompetent deals I've ever seen in my life. I'm not talking about nation-to-nation. Secretary Kerry never stood up and said we're walking. And if he did he could have made a much better deal. And I don't mind making deals for nuclear, I don't mind making great deals. Don't forget Obama thinks that global warming is our biggest threat. <BOOING> I happen to think it's nuclear warming. Our biggest threat is nuclear and it's not global warming. It's nuclear warming. And I'll tell you what, we're going to work very hard on that situation because that situation is getting more and more and more out of control. And Hillary talks tough about Russia and she talks tough about a lot of things. She has no clue. She talked tough about Libya, looked what happened there. She has no clue. She is unfit to be president because she has such bad judgment. Bernie Sanders said she has bad judgment. I said, thank you Bernie, I'm going to be using that for about six months after they take. Look what happened with WikiLeaks. They took the election away from the guy. How could he be supporting her? They took that election away. It was a rigged system. The whole system is rigged. And that's why when the media does what they're doing now, that's rigging the system, folks. It's rigging the system. The election is rigged. It's rigged like you've never seen before. They're rigging the system. These are very dishonest people. <BOOING> So folks, I love the people of North Carolina. Going to be back here a lot over the next 25 days, can you believe it? Twenty-five. <APPLAUSE> But you've got to get out and you've got to vote. Got to get out and vote. You've got to get out and vote because we are going to make our country strong again. We're going to make our country rich again. We're going to make our country smart again. We're going to be a smart country again. And what else are we going to do? We're going to make our country great again. Thank you very much. God bless, you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. ","The Grammar Lab"

<TRUMP:> <inaudible> start by thanking the fire marshal. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> days, we are going to win <inaudible> Wisconsin. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> we're going to deliver real change <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> We're going to renegotiate <inaudible>, stop the massive <inaudible>, cut taxes and regulation <inaudible> and <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: We want Trump, we want Trump.>
<TRUMP:> <inaudible> <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> create millions of jobs <inaudible>, and repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> New jobs will come back <inaudible> like you've never seen before. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> Trump administration. <inaudible> taxes will go way down <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> Hillary <inaudible>. <BOOING> <inaudible> companies won't be leaving Wisconsin <inaudible>. There will be consequences <inaudible>. We're also going to end government corruption. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency of the United States. <APPLAUSE> Newly released FBI documents -- <inaudible> everybody understands exactly <inaudible>. Newly released FBI documents made public just today revealed just how deep this corruption goes. The undersecretary of state, Patrick <inaudible> the FBI <inaudible> unclassify e-mails from Hillary's illegal server <inaudible>. <BOOING> <Inaudible> in other words, the State Department is trying to cover up Hillary's crimes of sending classified information on her server where our enemies could easily access <inaudible>. This is a criminal act of conspiracy that included Hillary's deleting and bleaching <inaudible>. <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: Trump. Trump. Trump.>
<TRUMP:> <Inaudible> 2,000 people <inaudible>. And by the way, that's only a small percentage of this <inaudible>. But that's OK. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA, USA, USA.>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So you have the disappearance of 13 iPhones, many of them whacked with a hammer. Who here has gotten rid of your phone and hit it with a hammer? Anybody? Nobody? Oh, I want to <inaudible>. But she whacked them, a lot of them with her hammer; just whacked them. Two boxes -- I don't know if you know this -- two boxes of e-mail evidence has gone missing two weeks ago. <BOOING> And the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI. <BOOING> Remember also that Crooked Hillary lied under oath to Congress, saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure server. <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up. Lock her up.>
<TRUMP:> And she pretended not to know that the letter ""C"" meant confidential information <inaudible>. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times. Bad memory. And then in written testimony last week under oath, she couldn't remember approximately 21 times. <inaudible> I'll tell you <inaudible>. This is one of the great miscarriages of justice in the history of this country. What's happened to the Department of Justice, what's happened to the FBI is so sad. You have so many incredible people in Justice and the FBI. And they must be absolutely reeling. They probably don't believe themselves what's going on. We're witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a <inaudible> personal profit <inaudible> your expense. But it gets worse. It gets worse. The FBI documents which undersecretary of state Dr. Kennedy made the request for <inaudible> altering classification as part of a quid pro quo. In other words, a deal. This is totally corruption by any standards. Undersecretary Kennedy needs to resign. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump, Trump, Trump. USA, USA, USA.>
<TRUMP:> <inaudible>. I have to tell you, we haven't had any of this <inaudible>. The Bernie supporters had much more energy. They really did. They had a lot more energy. So Clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety and your country's safety as though it meant nothing to her at all, which it didn't. This magnitude is worse, in my opinion and in the opinion of many people in law enforcement, this is worse than Watergate, what's going on with her. And what did she get out of it? She gets to run for the presidency of the United States. <BOOING> But we're going to put an end to that on November 8th. <APPLAUSE> Those polls were great today, but, you know, they're also showing there's like an undercurrent that they can't poll. Remember when I was in the primaries: How's he doing in such and such? Well, it looks like he won't win that state. Then the next day it's like, he won in a landslide. They said, what happened? <APPLAUSE> We'll take it any way. I mean, this is, I guess like people don't want to say they are voting for Trump, which is OK. We'll take it any way we can. Do you agree? <APPLAUSE> But there's a big, big undercurrent out there. Another series of e-mails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists. One of the e-mails from a top Hillary official said, quote, ""Take the money with"" -- and you know what they had, exclamation, exclamation -- ""just take the money."" This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments. <BOOING> Remember, we're competing in a rigged election. This is a rigged election process. And I said it with me -- remember I won Louisiana? I said: Oh, how many delegates do I get? And they showed me that my opponents had more than I. I said, wait a minute, what's going on here? I won the state. I went there on a Friday night. We had these massive crowds, great state, and I won the state. So a week later I'm going over delegates, right <inaudible>, and they're saying: How many? I said, wait a minute, this guy has 18 and I have nine. I wanted to say <inaudible>. No, well that's the way the system works. I said, well, then it's a rigged system. But you have to say we figured it out, right? We figured it out. But it is. And Bernie Sanders with his, you know, super delegates, everything else, Bernie Sanders, I'll bet he wished he wished he didn't endorse Hillary. He would have been something very special in history, but we're not going to let that happen to us, OK? Not to the movement. The media is trying to rig the election by giving credence -- and this is so true -- by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and make it the front page. They take a story with absolutely nothing, that didn't exist, and they put it front page news because they want to poison the minds of the voters. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Media sucks. Media sucks.>
<TRUMP:> Well, they really do. I mean, they want to poison the minds. They take things and statements and put it in from 30 years ago, from 20 years ago. By the way, just so you understand, just to be very clear, events that never happened. Just so you do understand that. It's so amazing. It's amazing. I think most people do believe me. That's why we are having -- and it's in our favor -- a backlash like nobody's ever seen before. They're tired. People are tired of it -- front page news, a phone call; front page news, and then it turns out it's false stuff. It's all false stuff. There's a backlash. A very, very prominent person from Wisconsin just left the back room. I said hello to him, and he said, ""Mr. Trump, I want to thank you. You are taking abuse the likes of which nobody has ever run for office has taken."" Very prominent person. And I really appreciate it. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible>. And most importantly, you have your former Miss Wisconsin, right? Your former Miss Wisconsin, who got out of the hospital to be with us. This is one of the greatest people you will ever -- who got out of the hospital. Stay out of that hospital, will you? This is an amazing person, an amazing woman. Thank you. Thank you for being here. <APPLAUSE> And we have our generals and we have our sheriff. Nobody going to mess with this guy. <APPLAUSE> Nobody going to mess with this guy. And he was there early when he endorsed Trump. He was there very early when he endorsed. Thank you, Sheriff. I appreciate it. Sheriff Clark <ph>. And his family, more importantly, more importantly. Thank you for being here. Appreciate it. The media is an extension of the Clinton campaign, as WikiLeaks has proven. And they don't talk about WikiLeaks. They just keep talking about Trump, Trump, Trump. They want to put nice sexy headlines up, even though nothing happened, nothing took place, even though it's a total fabrication. They've got to start talking about WikiLeaks. They've got to start talking about the things that are going on. Hillary even got the questions and answers <inaudible>.
<AUDIENCE: Tell the truth. Tell the truth.>
<TRUMP:> We need some truth. We need truth. We do need truth. You know, to make America great again, we do need some truths from these people, <inaudible>. Because they poison the minds of others. Not everybody understands what's happening, and by the time they do figure it out, it's too late. They're poisoning the minds of others. Remember this, Hillary even got -- <CROSSTALK>
<TRUMP:> <inaudible>. That's OK. You notice, it's always one at a time. One at a time. <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA.>
<TRUMP:> By the way, where is Diane Hendricks <ph>? Where is she? Where is she? She's so amazing. One of your great, great successful people. She's an amazing woman. Diane, I know you're here someplace. Wherever you are, an amazing woman. Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate. How do you do that? And think of it, nobody made a big deal. Nobody even knows about it. She got the questions in advance to essentially a debate. Can you imagine -- no, no -- can you imagine if Donald Trump got the questions in advance? You know what they'd do? They'd reinvent the electric chair. That's what they'd do. You don't even hear about that. Sheriff, did you ever hear about this? Nobody has. She got -- and by the way, behind you is one of your great football players, folks. Look at this guy. <APPLAUSE> And he is a man of God, I will tell you. Thank you. Thank you. One of the greats. Oh, those championships. I don't know about Green Bay this year. What do you think? Are they going to be OK? He says yes, they'll be OK. A new report from the Center of Public Integrity shows that 96 percent of so-called journalists or reporters who made presidential donations this cycle gave their money, gave themselves, gave everything to crooked Hillary Clinton. Can you believe that? <BOOING> They even want to try to rig the elections at the polling booths. And believe me, there's a lot going on. Do you ever hear these people? They say there's nothing going on. People that have died 10 years ago are still voting. Illegal immigrants are voting. I mean, where are the street smarts of some of these politicians?
<AUDIENCE: They don't have any.>
<TRUMP:> They don't have any. He's right. So many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is very, very common. The following information comes straight from Pew Research, quote, ""Approximately 24 million people, one of every eight, voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or significantly inaccurate."" One in eight. More than 1.8 million deceased individuals right now are listed as voters. Oh, that's wonderful. <BOOING> Well, if they're going to vote for me, we'll think about it, right? But I have a feeling they're not going to vote for me. Of the 1.8 million, 1.8 million is voting for somebody else. Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.
<AUDIENCE: Trump. Trump. Trump.>
<TRUMP:> Do we love our police. Do we love our police law enforcement? Law enforcement, thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. You can see they're getting angrier and angrier with <inaudible>. No, because there's such a disturbance <inaudible>. Then there's the issue of illegal immigrants voting. The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post. This article was entitled, ""Could non-citizens decide the November election?"" Here are some excerpts. ""More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote."" Oh, isn't that wonderful. ""Because non-citizens tend to favor Democrats,"" to put it mildly, ""Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample."" You don't read about this, right? They don't tell you about this. Your politicians don't tell you about this when they tell you how legitimate all of these elections are. They don't want to tell you about this. ""We find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in various close elections."" OK? All right? ""Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass healthcare reform and many other reforms, and other Obama administration priorities."" Now, it continues: ""It is possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,000 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult citizens"" -- and by the way, we're doing great in North Carolina; We're going to win North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> But we don't want non-citizen voters, if that's OK. Is that all right to ask that? It could have provided his margin of victory. Our system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton's campaign. And again, I will have spent over $100 million on my campaign. I am controlling myself. I'm working for you, folks. I'm working for you, believe me. <APPLAUSE> And they're all telling me what a great job and what a big movement -- there's never been anything like this in this country, and they all admit it. Even the enemies back there admit it. But if I don't win, it will be the greatest waste of time, energy and money that I will have -- oh, what a waste. What a waste. They all say, it won't be a waste. You'll be in the history books. Let me tell you something, folks: I don't want to be in -- I want to win. If we win, we will do something. We will make -- we're going to make America great again. <APPLAUSE> The reason that Hillary Clinton pushes the job-killing NAFTA, Trans-Pacific Partnership -- which you cannot let happen. It's a disaster.
<AUDIENCE: Build the wall.>
<TRUMP:> And for complete -- oh, don't worry, we're building the wall. Build the wall.
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall. Build that wall.>
<TRUMP:> Who is going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico.>
<TRUMP:> One hundred percent. By the way, I'm not kidding, 100 percent. All of these partnerships and for completely open borders. She wants open borders. She wants people to pour across our borders. We won't have a country, folks. It's because her international donors control every single move she makes. If we let the Clinton cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence. We will not let that happen. It is time. <APPLAUSE> It is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. <APPLAUSE> This is why I'm proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. When Bill Clinton -- who was right about Obamacare two weeks ago, by the way. He said it's crazy -- came into office, he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency, you can't lobby the government for five years after you leave. But then President Clinton did what the Clintons always do. He rigged the system on his way out. Clinton lifted the executive order so Clinton cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash. <BOOING> So here's what we as a group are announcing tonight. First, I'm going to reinstitute a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for five years after they leave government service. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order, right? Second, I'm going to ask Congress to institute its own five-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> Third, I'm going to expand the definition of ""lobbyist"" so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants, advisers, all of these different things, and they get away with murder. <APPLAUSE> Fourth, I'm going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. <APPLAUSE> Fifth, I'm going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections and politics. <APPLAUSE> This will go a long way to ending our government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation also, and that will help. My plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. <APPLAUSE> Jobs. They're taking our jobs away. They're going to Mexico. They're going all over the place. We're going to keep our companies here, folks. They're not leaving. If they want to leave, there will be consequences. You understand that. And they won't leave when they hear those consequences. Believe me, they're not leaving. Our politicians have worked for years to try and keep our companies. It's so easy. It's so easy. You want to leave? You want to build? You want to build -- whatever you want to build -- cars. Ford is leaving. Carrier is leaving. So many companies. There's so many. You know, we lost 70,000 factories -- 70,000 factories since the signing of NAFTA. I thought it was a typographical error. I figured maybe 700; maybe 7,000: 70,000 factories. At the center of my jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade bills. They are horrible. Forty-seven million Americans are in poverty, and 45 million Americans are on, right now, food stamps. We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the rest of the world; and the worst so-called recovery by far since the Great Depression. Did you see the jobs numbers the other day? Horrible. You saw our GDP is going to be, in my opinion, less than 1 percent. You know, if China goes to 7 percent, 8 percent, 9 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. If we are at less than 1 percent, which is what it will be, it's like, oh, what else? We're not going to put up with it. It's the Clintons who gave us NAFTA. He signed it, remember that. Bill Clinton signed the worst trade deal in the history of the world. <BOOING> And the Clintons who gave us China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Here in Wisconsin -- do we love Wisconsin?
<AUDIENCE: Yes. Yes.>
<TRUMP:> You know why I'm here? First of all, I have a lot of friends here. But you know why I'm here? I'm here because everyone's calling me, everyone's calling to say we're going to win Wisconsin. <APPLAUSE> It's not so traditional -- no, but it's not so traditional for a Republican to be in this position. Mostly they say, well, we'll have to skip Wisconsin. Not me. We're going to win Wisconsin. <APPLAUSE> Companies like Briggs &amp; Stratton have cut thousands of manufacturing jobs and moved them where? To China. G.E. Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped those jobs to Mexico. Did you know that, Sheriff? They just closed up. That's a lot of jobs they shipped over to Mexico. Johnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and moved the jobs to China, and moved the jobs all over the place except for here. <BOOING> The list goes on and on. Many, many companies leaving Wisconsin, leaving everywhere. They're leaving our country. We are living through the single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. It's true. Our companies are being raided. Our jobs are being let go. We end up with unemployment and empty buildings. They end up with cash. They end up with cash; tremendous factories like you've never seen, magnificent plants, jobs all over the place. You know, we end up actually with two things: unemployment and drugs. They end up with the cash. We end up with the drugs. Not so good. A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and get along with China. We don't get along with China now. They rip us off. And stop the jobs from leaving our country. And I do a lot of business with China. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant in one of my buildings in Manhattan, and China is wonderful. I mean, I wish our people ran our country, I mean, like, they're like smart people. They're smart people. We don't have smart people running our country. We have people that are incompetent. We have a president -- we have a president, all he wants to do is campaign for Hillary Clinton so that she can double your health care costs. All he does is campaign. <BOOING> This guy, every time you see him, he's campaigning for Clinton, and frankly, he ought to be working on jobs. He ought to be working on the Second Amendment and the border and all these different things. He ought to be working on taking care of our veterans, right, and our military. <APPLAUSE> There's a guy -- we go into Mosul. We go into Mosul. And why don't we just go in quietly, right? They used to call it a sneak attack. Let's call it we want to do it nice and easy. I've been reading about it for four months. Now a primary reason for going in was we wanted to get the leaders of ISIS, right? They're gone, folks. They're smart people. They read the same newspapers and articles that we read. They said, ""Hey, they're going to attack Mosul in four months; let's get the hell out of here."" They're all over the place. How stupid are our people. Can you imagine the great General George Patton and General MacArthur? I really had a lot of respect. You know what they're doing, right? They're spinning in their graves. And I see we will be attacking some time next week. I've been reading about this for months. And I honestly -- a big, big part, I've always heard -- and I always used to wonder why they don't go in. But I meant like, why are they <inaudible>, right? Surprise. Remember? They used to call it the element of surprise. Now our element of surprise is in four months we will be attacking Mosul. I wonder what General Clinton -- what our generals think about that. Not too good. Not too good. I can tell you what generals think <inaudible>. As part of our plan to create at least 25 million jobs in 10 years, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make our nation rich again. We're going to have great companies. We're going to have great jobs and jobs are going to start coming back to America. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. National security begins at the border. Speaking in a secret meeting to a foreign government, Hillary Clinton said her dream is for total open trade -- there go the rest of your jobs -- and open borders. There goes your country. <BOOING> Between open trade -- your jobs -- open borders -- your country -- so you lost your jobs and your country. Other than that, she's doing a great job. By ""open trade,"" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of dollars and millions of jobs -- and literally not millions of dollars; really, it's really trillions and trillions of dollars. By ""open borders,"" she means totally unlimited immigration. In a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said citizens <inaudible> irredeemable. He's a deplorable guy <inaudible>. So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable or irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers. That's what she called Bernie Sanders's people -- basement dwellers. Oh, Bernie, why did you do it, Bernie? We know his people are saying: Why did you do it, Bernie? Why did you do it? Poor Bernie. Now he has a rally and 100 people show up <inaudible>. He could have left a great mark on history. He won't. Hillary's plan includes -- although I think we're going to get a lot of Bernie people because one of the things Bernie knew is that we were being ripped off on trade. It's a big factor. <AUDIO GAP>
<TRUMP:> -- are not only going to make that, but we're going to have a lot of trade. We're going to make breakthroughs. We're going to have a double highway. We're going to have things coming back to us -- <AUDIO GAP>.
<TRUMP:> So let me state this as clearly as I can. <APPLAUSE> <AUDIO GAP>
<AUDIENCE: USA, USA, USA.>
<TRUMP:> -- administration will secure -- <AUDIO GAP>
<TRUMP:> -- and defend our borders. And yes, we will build the wall that we just -- so tell me about the wall. Other people, many other people, but they are poisoning our youth before our youth gets a chance to go and make it. They are being poisoned by this garbage that's pouring in from the southern border. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back. We would bring them -- we would have a murderer, we would have a drug lord, we would have the heads of gangs and gang members, we'd bring them back to their countries. They intelligently said, ""We don't want them."" Kick them out. And our guys would say, ""Oh, yes, OK."" And Hillary Clinton never forced these criminals back into their own countries where they came from. <BOOING> And I guarantee you, not one time as president will you see that happen, not one time. There will be no times when we don't take these people and put them into their country where that country is telling us, ""Take them back; We don't want that murderer."" That country is taking their people back. There's a reason they are here. You remember a long time ago I said they are forcing some of the people in. Let me tell you, we have some people in this country that are bad dudes. We're getting them out, we're bringing them back to the country they came from, and the country is going to take them. <APPLAUSE> The ICE officers, in their endorsement of me, described Hillary's proposal as, quote, ""the most radical immigration proposal in United States history."" Here is a summary of Hillary's plan. Support totally for sanctuary cities -- <AUDIO GAP>
<TRUMP:> -- Some bad, bad people are getting security in sanctuary cities. Social Security, Medicare, and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens. And in many cases they are being treated better than our great veterans. Remember that. And we're not going to allow it. <BOOING> Obamacare for illegal immigrants; No deportation of visa overstays; Expanded catch and release on the border. You catch them, hey, go ahead, do whatever you want. It's called catch and release. Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers. Bringing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non- enforcement directives. And she wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees to come into this country <inaudible>. <BOOING> And that's over Obama's number. Either we win this election or we lose our country. I mean that. I really believe this is the last time. This is it, folks. This is it. I really believe this is the last shot we have. I sort of felt it last time. This time I don't just feel it. I know it. Under a Trump administration it's going to be America first.
<AUDIENCE: USA, USA, USA>
<TRUMP:> By the way, that is the most beautiful little girl. A lot of beautiful -- look how beautiful. Hi. You want to come up and see me? You want to come up? Come on. The most beautiful little girl. Wow. And she got all decked out for this evening. Wow. So beautiful. Oh, come on, OK, just -- no more of those. No more. Come on, bring her. So beautiful. <APPLAUSE> What's your name?
<UNKNOWN: My name is (inaudible).>
<TRUMP:> And do you know that -- where are your parents? Where are your parents? Wow, congratulations. What a gem. What a beautiful person you are. <APPLAUSE> They did a good job. Come on up here. Come on. So beautiful. Look at this. <CROSSTALK>
<TRUMP:> And do you love Wisconsin?
<UNKNOWN: Yes.>
<TRUMP:> This is what it's all about, right? Beautiful. Beautiful job; beautiful job, mom and dad. We just made two big stars. We made two big stars. Two great people. Thank you. Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017. We're going to have one of the biggest job- producing tax cuts in American history. It's going to be amazing. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. <APPLAUSE> We are going to defend religious liberty. <APPLAUSE> We will provide school choice to every low-income child in America. Rebuild our depleted military and take care of our great, great, great veterans. <APPLAUSE> We're going to support the men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We will again repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> Here's one very important to Wisconsin. We will save our Second Amendment -- <APPLAUSE> -- which is under siege. We will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> You have 22 days to make every dream you've ever dreamed for yourself and your family come true. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, which is <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to fight for every citizen of every background, from every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. We have so much poverty in this country, which is so hard to believe. I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence. I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries. So many. I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and special interests. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. We live in a very divided country. We're not going to live in a divided country much longer. There's going to be spirit. We're going to get along. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.
<AUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA.>
<TRUMP:> I want to tell you, Wisconsin loves this country. You really do. You people are amazing. In 10 and 20 and 30 and 40 years, you're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like nobody in this country has ever seen before. <APPLAUSE> You're going to look back at this election and say, ""This is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time."" <APPLAUSE> Because once again, we're going to have a government of, by and for the people. <APPLAUSE> And you will see things start to happen. We are going to make America wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We are going to make America safe again. And we are going to make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. God bless you, everybody. God bless you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-18"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Wow. This is incredible. You know we have people wrapped all the way around the hangar as deep as this? I hope they can come over here. Should we let them over here? Yes, right? Right? <APPLAUSE> These are people from the western slopes. We better let them over, right? Come on over, folks. Get on over here. There are thousands of people back there. Well, it's 21 days we are going to win the state of Colorado, and we are going to win the White House. We're going to win the White House. <APPLAUSE> I'll tell you what, we are going through some very interesting times. But it's going to be so exciting on November 8th, that's the big day. Get out and vote, right? Get out and vote. <APPLAUSE> And make sure to mail the ballots. You have those ballots, those very beautiful ballots. Election day, early voting. I think it starts, what, the 24th? Is it the 24th? Yes. So, do the early voting if you can. Definitely November 8th we get out. We're going to win, we're going to take back the White House, we're going to put America first again. <APPLAUSE> We're going to deliver real, real change. It's going to be a beautiful thing. And we are going to end the government of corruption, which it has definitely been. And we are going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C., and that's what it is. <APPLAUSE> We're also going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime all over our country, cut taxes and regulations. She wants to build your taxes. Rebuild our military, which is in pretty sad shape right now, unfortunately. <APPLAUSE> It's very depleted. We have the greatest people in the world in our military, but it has really become depleted and we are going to fix it and make it better, and hopefully never have to use it. But it's going to be there. We are going to take care of our vets and repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> We're also going to unleash American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal. <APPLAUSE> That means getting rid of job-killing EPA regulations that are unnecessary. So many unnecessary. We're going to put the miners right here in Colorado back to work. We're going to put them back to work. <APPLAUSE> Who's a miner? Raise your hand. You, you don't look like a miner. A lot of miners. Get ready to go to work. Get ready to go to work. You want to go back to work? You're going to go back to work. Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. Your taxes will go way, way down under a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> Your companies won't be leaving Colorado under a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have a new government that serves the people. Hasn't done that in a long time. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for president. <BOOING> You heard about the newly released FBI documents? They reveal just how corrupt she is and it is. Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy illegally pressured -- who really illegally pressured the FBI to unclassify e-mails from Hillary's illegal server. That server is a disaster. <BOOING> You know, I just ripped out an article out of the paper just today, where a four-star general -- one of the most highly respected people in the military -- was charged with something, and he has agreed to a devastating sentence. And it's very sad to see, and I spoke to General Kellogg and I spoke to General Flynn, who you know. They are here someplace. Where are they? Come here, generals. Come here. Where is General Kellogg? <APPLAUSE> You guys are great. Great guys.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Amazing. I just spoke to the generals. These are real generals too, these are real guys. I love having them on my plane, but when I'm on my plane with them I sort of feel like I'm number three. Does that make sense? You know, they're generals. But I will tell you, I just cut out the article -- major article from the Wall Street Journal -- and it talked about a certain general, a highly decorated man, a very respected man, and he just pled guilty to doing exactly what she did, except like two percent of what she did. General, do you want to mention it?
<FLYNN: And he basically took responsibility and accountability for his actions. She did not, and she deserves -- he did a 10th of what she did, and he's going to find himself probably serving a jail sentence. And Hillary Clinton did exactly the same, lied to the FBI, under oath. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. (BOOING)>
<KELLOGG: Both Mike and I know General Cartwright. He's an honorable man, and he did what you would expect of a senior officer. He took full accountability, full responsibility... (APPLAUSE) ... for something that was minuscule compared to what she has done. And he's going to accept responsibility and the consequences, which is probably a fine, jail time, and the loss of his security clearance for the rest of his life. (BOOING)>
<TRUMP:> I mean honestly, it's unbelievable.
<KELLOGG: The next president of the United States right here. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, fellas. Great guys, great guys. Great guys, but think of General Cartwright for doing three percent of what she did, and life is destroyed. The State Department was trying to cover up Hillary's crimes of sending classified information on the server our enemies could easily access. Now, think of what we just said about a four-star general, just happened. I just actually picked the article -- I said, is this something like what happened with her? They said, this is a tiny fraction of what she did. It is so -- it is so disgraceful. She shouldn't be allowed to run for the office of president. <APPLAUSE> The FBI documents show that Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a quid pro quo. <BOOING> Nothing's going to happen. Do you think anything is going to happen?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> You know, we are wasting time. Do you think anything is going to be -- might as well -- in fact, today the story came out and they had it like a little story. Because almost as corrupt as crooked Hillary Clinton is the media right back there. <BOOING> Clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all to her. Remember also that Hillary lied under oath to Congress, saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure server, and pretended not to know what the letter C meant, confidential information that was classified, right. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 30 times, right? Thirty-nine. Thirty-nine times, and then in written testimony last week under oath she couldn't remember another 21 times. Bad memory. She's got a bad memory. What can you do? <BOOING> Take a look at the General Cartwright story. This elaborate criminal cover-up included Hillary's deleting and bleaching 33,000 e- mails. The disappearance of 13 phones, some of which were hammered, boom, boom. Hammered. Who hammered their phone when they got rid of it? Anybody here? This guy. We've got to watch him, check him. <LAUGHTER> Two boxes of e-mail evidence is now missing as of two weeks ago. Missing. Add the destruction of laptops. This is many times worse than Watergate. And we are going to put an end to it come November 8th. <APPLAUSE> Now they say we are tied in Colorado. I don't think so, I'll be honest. I mean, something is going on here, something. You know, they say we are tied. Every place I go, we have thousands, and you can't honestly -- you don't know what's on the other side of this wall. You won't even believe it. But they say we are tied, I don't think we are tied. The other one says we are two up. One says we are four up. One said we were six or seven down. That was the one that they show on television. They don't show the other ones. These people, but they say -- let's say we are tied, then how come we have thousands and thousands of people, thousands and thousands. Sort of an amazing thing. Oh, and these people here, they are getting $1,500 to do that, $1,500. <BOOING> You see how professional they are? Look at the guy now, he's just walking out. So, yesterday there was a story that the DNC, Democratic National Committee, is sending protesters in here, paying them $1,500. Look at that guy, he's like a pro. They got him out, now he's just walking. <BOOING> You know, is disgusting. It just came out yesterday, and I thought so, but the way they got him, he walked out. By the time he got to the door it was all over, puts everything, and now he's off. Look at him. And you know what? It's all over the Internet. The mainstream media hardly wrote about it and they caught him yesterday. Not him. They pay $1,500 and they give iPhones to everybody if you go in and disrupt. This is what we're dealing with these people, these are bad people. And the press doesn't cover it. And now look, they are covering him being taken out, and they will say a protester, like he's this innocent little lamb. <BOOING> And then you wonder why our country is in trouble. Then you wonder why our country is in trouble. Take a look at what's happening now in Mosul. They give them four months warning. They were to get ISIS, they want to get the leaders. They announced four months ago, we are going in to get the leaders. The leaders are smart, they say, hey, they're coming in to get us, let's get the hell out of here. They're gone. And they are meeting resistance, on top of everything else. Boy, whatever happened. Do you remember the expression, the element of surprise? You get them and then you tell the public and they will be very happy to hear it a week later. These people are so just sad. Another series of leaked e-mails show top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from registered foreign lobbyists. But don't hear the media talking about it. We all talk about it -- WikiLeaks proved. And by the way, they are not being covered, they want to cover fictitious stories about me, it's fiction. They want to cover -- they just want to cover fictitious stories on me. WikiLeaks has provided things that are unbelievable. The media, you have to remember, is an extension of the Hillary Clinton campaign. <BOOING> And without that she would be nowhere. The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the minds of the voters, many of the voters. Of course a lot of voters, their minds are just fine. They know exactly what's going on. <APPLAUSE> They have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories, most recently about phony allegations where I've been under attack constantly. Instead of covering WikiLeaks and all of those things, they attack business, they attacked my family. They even attacked my temperament. It's always been my best thing. <LAUGHTER> I built an incredible company... <APPLAUSE> I have built an incredible company. I'm fortunate to have a beautiful and great family -- loving family. And my temperament, it's -- hey, we have a winning temperament. We know how to win. We don't win any more, right? <APPLAUSE> Our country, our country doesn't win anymore, folks. Look, when do we win? We can't win with our great military because our leaders won't let us, by the way. Just so you know. It's not the military. Our leaders won't let us. We don't win in the economy. Look at our jobs report from last week, it was a disaster. Our jobs report last week was catastrophic. And that's the last one before the election so maybe that should help. This is an election about the truth. It's going to be about the truth. I didn't need to do this, that I can tell you. A lot of people cannot handle the truth, but no matter what people may think of me, the one thing they know is that I am always going to tell you what's happening, what's happening with our country. I'm telling you the good and the bad, but it's going to start being the good. <APPLAUSE> I mean, you can't believe anything you see. I don't even believe the polls. I see these polls, and they're not terrible. They're sort of good. And actually, if the people come out and vote -- they are very nervous. I have a feeling this is another Brexit. This is going to be interesting. They don't want to show you the good. <APPLAUSE> If they take five polls of the same group, they will always show the bad one. But the bad ones fine, it's fine. You've got to get out and vote. I'll tell you what, we are going to have one of the greatest victories in political history if we get out and vote. <APPLAUSE> And when Hillary develops the energy to go to events -- she's got very small crowd. If she came up here, as an example, if she came here, she would have, let's say, maybe the little group on the right- hand, but it wouldn't be them. <LAUGHTER> I think the media is trying to discourage our people from getting out and voting, I do. It's a very crooked group of people. Without the media and all the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way, honestly she'd be nothing, folks, she'd be nothing. Tomorrow night's going to be interesting. <APPLAUSE> Now she's home sleeping and I'm working, so that's the way. The way it's going to be in the White House, too. She'd be sleeping, I'd be working. <APPLAUSE> Even my worst critics agree the media has come after us like they have never, ever, ever come after anyone before, never. I mean, I'm like -- there's never been a hit or a pile-on, and even they admit it. They even say it. The failing New York Times -- and it is failing, it won't be in business, in my opinion, more than three or four more years. They said in an article -- in a major article -- let's face it, balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump onto his golden Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy, so true. They admit it. And then they go on to say, we don't care. We don't care. We'll do whatever is necessary to defeat him and to defeat those people. That's what they want to do. They want to stop our agenda for change, but we won't let them. History is watching us now, waiting to see if we will rise to the moment. The moment is going to be November 8th, it's very simple. <APPLAUSE> And we will. We've just begun to fight. They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common. And then they say, there's no voter fraud in our country. There's no voter fraud. No, no, there's no voter fraud. Take a look at St. Louis, take a look at Philadelphia, take a look at Chicago. And then I have even the Republicans saying, this is a wonderful -- look, look, if nothing else, people are going to be watching on November 8th. Watch Philadelphia, watch St. Louis, watch Chicago. Watch so many other places. But then do you ever notice they say there is no voter fraud. Now there's a voter fraud also with the media because they so poisoned the minds of the people by writing false stories. They are -- I have, actually, they are more crooked than crooked Hillary, I really do. That's a lot. <APPLAUSE> In 2014, the Washington Post -- that's another beauty -- published an article entitled ""Could non-citizens decide the November election?"" Guys, that's the Washington Post. The article found that 14 percent... They are having a good time. Were they friend or foe?
<AUDIENCE: Foe!>
<TRUMP:> The article found that 14 percent of non-citizens were registered to vote, and it also found non-citizen voting may have given Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to pass horrible Obamacare. <BOOING> Now, just think of that for a second. And then you heard like 1.8 million people are dead or shouldn't be on the lists, right? You've got dead people voting. How did that happen? I don't know. And I listen to all of these politicians saying the system is wonderful. Gotta fix the system. The system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton's campaign. The reason crooked Hillary pushes for NAFTA or the Transpacific Partnership and for completely open borders is because her international donors control her every single move. If we let the Clinton cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was a year America lost its independence. That's true, that's true. It will not happen on our watch, OK? <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> It's like when they look back at us at this time, you know, in history, we will not be the ones that they talk about the replacement of the great Trojan horse, right? You understand that. We're not going to be the fools that allow that to happen. And I say it again, when it comes to Washington, D.C., it is time to drain the damn swamp. <APPLAUSE> That's why I'm proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. First, I'm going to institute a five- year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service. They become rich, they become rich. Second, I going to ask Congress to institute its own five-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs. They become rich. I mean, these staffs become rich. Third, I'm going to expand the definition of lobbyist, so we close all loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisers, when we all know they are just lobbyists, right? Lobbyists. Fourth, I'm going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, right? And fifth, I'm going to ask Congress to pass a campaign-finance reform that stops registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections, right? <APPLAUSE> There's another major announcement I'm making today as part of our pledge to drain the swamp. If I'm elected president, I will push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. <APPLAUSE> I am proposing a term limit of six years for members of the House and 12 years for members of the Senate. <APPLAUSE> Decades of political failure and special interest collusion must and will finally come to an end. It's time to sweep the corruption out of Washington. That is why I will also ask for a ban on both White House and congressional officials fund-raising during working hours. They are always fund-raising. And I've been on the other side, I've been on the other side. I've given a lot of money over the years and they always come up during the day. I say, when you people have time to work? I don't have time to work. After 6 o'clock. When you're working for the taxpayer, you should be doing just that. <APPLAUSE> Not only will we end government corruption but we will also end the crippling economic stagnation that we are in. <APPLAUSE> My plans for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words. You know what they are? Jobs, jobs, jobs. <APPLAUSE> At the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, the worst deals that anybody has ever made economically in trade. Forty-seven million Americans are in poverty, and 45 million Americans are right now in this country on food stamps. Are they getting $1,500? Can you believe it? No can you believe it? And the press doesn't want to write the story. They get paid to do this. <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Can you believe they get paid for doing this by the Democratic National Committee? Maybe I will do it a couple of times. It's good money, I'll get a nice new phone. Unbelievable. I'm sure their parents are very proud of them. Two people. So, we have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world. That's in trade. We lost $800 billion, we have a trade deficit. And the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and you people know it better than anybody right here. The worst since the Great Depression. Economic growth is at a total standstill and workers are earning less today than they were almost 20 years ago. Colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA, a deal supported very strongly by Hillary Clinton, who, by the way, has been doing this stuff for 30 years. She's done a pretty rotten job, wouldn't you think. We lost -- listen to this -- 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization. China is gaining a lot of factories, probably a lot more than that. Another Bill and Hillary- backed deal. We are also living through the greatest jobs theft in American history, probably in the history of the world. They say actually probably in the history of the world. It's a jobs theft because our politicians are stupid. They are stupid people. And if they are not stupid, they are under the control of the special interests and donors. So, whether it is stupid or corrupt, it doesn't matter. The result is the same. A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating. And you know what they are doing with money supply, you know what they are doing with devaluation. And stop the jobs from leaving our country. <APPLAUSE> As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent, we're the highest tax in the nation -- we are the highest taxed in the world, and we are going to be among the lower taxed in the world. We are the highest taxed nation in the world. We are going to be among the lower taxed. Not quite the lowest, but we're getting there. We're also going to fix our inner cities, which have been failed and it's disgraceful what Democrats have done to destroy our inner cities. Forty-five percent of African-American children, under the age of six, are living in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African American youth are not working. Almost 3,500 people have been shot in the city of Chicago -- listen to this -- since January 1st. It's like a war zone. People are getting shot walking to the store. The education is terrible and there are no jobs. The national murder rate has experienced the largest single-year increase in 45 years. To those African-Americans suffering, and to those Latinos suffering, I say, what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I'm going to fix it. <APPLAUSE> I'm gonna fix it. I will fight harder for you than anyone has ever fought for you before. We will be a rich nation again. We will be able to do things that we want to do. Right now we owe $20 trillion, doubled since Obama came to office. <BOOING> And he should stop campaigning for crooked Hillary, and he ought to get out and work on jobs and work on the border. Boy, oh boy, he's got a lot of work. Fortunately, he doesn't have much time left. <APPLAUSE> But to be a rich country we must also be a safe country. National security begins at the border. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, crooked Hillary Clinton said her dream is for open trade -- there go your jobs -- and open borders -- there goes your country. That's what it is. Your jobs, your country. <BOOING> By open trade she means letting foreign countries cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions in wealth. By open borders she means totally unlimited immigration. Come on in, folks. Come on in. <BOOING> Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores and in your own community. <BOOING> Just today an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS. He entered as a refugee in November 2009, then was approved for a green card in 2011. It's one of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of examples of the United States voluntarily, right, voluntarily admitting people from the world's most dangerous places, who turn out to be terrorists. And by the way, we won't go over the stats and we won't go over individual cases, but the crime is unbelievable, vicious and violent. So, let me say this as clearly as I can. If I am elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> That's the Trojan horse, folks. That's the Trojan horse. We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure our borders and protect our jobs, including jobs for millions of African-American and Latino workers. And yes, we will build a wall. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!>
<TRUMP:> We're going to build the wall, don't worry, and Mexico is going to pay for the wall. They just don't know it yet. <APPLAUSE> We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers, great people. ICE just two weeks ago. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries refused to take them. They were too violent. They were too violent, so we took them back. Who would do this? Who would do this? You know who would do this? A weak and pathetic politician would do this. The ICE officer described Hillary's proposal as the most radical immigration proposal in United States history. Here is a summary of what she wants to do, support sanctuary cities. <BOOING> Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for all illegal immigrants by making them citizens. <BOOING> Obamacare, which will die anyway, for illegal immigrants. No -- and this is crazy, no deportation of visa overstays. Expanding catch and release on the border. Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers. There go your jobs. <BOOING> Freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non- enforcement directive. And here is the topper of all, as you know, President Obama has let thousands and thousands of people come in from Syria. She wants to have a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into this country. <BOOING> Either we win this election or we lose the country. This is the last time we've got a shot, folks. It's not going to happen after that. The numbers aren't there, the numbers aren't there. This is the last time. I hope you get up on November 8th or you send in those early ballots, but I hope you get up on November 8th and get out and get every person you know out to vote. <APPLAUSE> Under a Trump administration, it's going to be again America first, remember that. <APPLAUSE> Finally, here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country, starting in 2017. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, a big one. <APPLAUSE> We will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation where you folks are being killed up here. <APPLAUSE> We are going to unleash job-creating American energy, which is a big factor here. <APPLAUSE> We are going to defend religious liberty. We're going to provide school choice to every low income child in America and we are going to end Common Core education. <APPLAUSE> We are going to rebuild our depleted military, and we are going to take care of our great, great veterans, it's time. <APPLAUSE> We are going to support the men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We will save our Second Amendment, which is totally under siege. <APPLAUSE> And we will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> You have 21 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country, for your family, for yourselves come true. Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. We're going to have a unified country. <APPLAUSE> It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment. On November 8th we are going to win. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom and for every dad who's lost a child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence is deplorable -- to use her horrible term in referring to certain friends of mine. <APPLAUSE> And irredeemable. That's even worse. That means you have no chance. I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries, lot of jobs. I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests. <APPLAUSE> And I am going to fight to bring Americans together for the first time in a long time. <APPLAUSE> Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag, right? <APPLAUSE> In 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, you're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life and you're going to be very, very proud. This is a movement that we have going like they have never seen before. They're trying everything they can to stop it. <APPLAUSE> They're doing everything they can to stop it. They are fighting, the press is fighting, crooked Hillary is fighting. They're doing everything they can. They're lying, they're cheating, they're stealing. They're doing everything -- these people right back here -- everything they can to stop it. But I don't think they're going to stop it. I don't think they're going to stop it. You're going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote that you've ever cast, for anyone, at any time. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have a real government, of, by and for the people for the first time in a long time. <APPLAUSE> You are going to be once again so proud of your country, and hopefully you will be very, very proud of your president. <APPLAUSE> I promise you that we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-21"">
<SEAN HANNITY, >
<FNC: Joining us now with details, 2016 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, how are you? DONALD TRUMP (R), >
<PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:> I'm very good, thank you, Sean.
<HANNITY: Can you give us a preview? It almost sounds like a ""Contract with America"" or promises to America that you're going to be talking about tomorrow. What can you tell us?>
<TRUMP:> Well, we're going to be doing a lot of things. We're going to be lowering taxes. We're going to be strengthening our borders. We're going to be getting rid of regulations. The regulations are going to be gone because, I mean, you look at this country, what's happening with regulations. And we need them for security and we need them for certain things like the environment, but our regulations are just taking over our companies. We can't compete anymore. We're going to be terminating, repealing and replacing ""Obama care."" We're going to be saving our 2nd Amendment. There are a lot of things, Sean. It's going to be -- I think it's going to be very special.
<HANNITY: I talk a lot about the profound differences, the Supreme Court, vetting refugees, saying ""radical Islam,"" cutting taxes, raising taxes, keeping ""Obama care,"" getting rid of ""Obama care,"" building a wall, not building a wall, energy independence, no independence, education to down or to the states -- those are deep, profound differences. Do you think the voters understand the choice that is theirs this election?>
<TRUMP:> Well, I think they do, and I think if they watched the debates, they would really understand a lot. I mean, right now, I think you have two very clear -- you have a really clear choice between Hillary Clinton and myself. And if you just look at the stances on everything -- she's going to raise taxes, I'm going to lower taxes. She's going to increase regulations, I'm going to cut regulations down to a minimum, a good number, but down to a minimum. And there's so many different things. We're going to rebuild the military., We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to save the 2nd Amendment. We're going to repeal and replace ""Obama care,"" which is a total disaster. She wants to make it even a bigger mess and going to spend trillions and trillions of dollars on it. And it's crazy what's going on.
<HANNITY: Yes.>
<TRUMP:> And so you have really clear choice. You have a very, very distinct choice.
<HANNITY: You have been very critical in the media throughout this entire process. Now through Wikileaks, we know the following news organizations -- Univision, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times, Politico, The Boston Globe -- all of these organizations -- CNN -- in one way, fashion or form have been in the pocket of Hillary Clinton. What's your reaction to that?>
<TRUMP:> Well, it's totally brutal. I mean, you can do something that's, you know, just fabulous, it's perfect, everything's great, and then they end up giving you bad news and bad stories, bad coverage. It's the single greatest pile-on. They say -- this isn't me saying it, this is other people, and even news organizations -- the single greatest pile-on. Despite that, you just saw the crowd we had outside. We're in Pennsylvania now. We just left North Carolina. I'm going back to Pennsylvania. I'm going to a different section in Pennsylvania in a little while. We have a massive crowd there. It's been unbelievable what's going on. And I think that it's not pollable, although, as you know, three polls came out today saying I'm leading nationwide. And look, it's a question of taxes. It's a question of borders. Do we want to have a country or not? We're going to have strong borders. And we're going to have people come into our country, but Sean, they're going to come in legally, through a process. They're going to come in legally. So you know, I think a lot was learned in the debates. I think you understand how we did and how well we did in the debates, and I think we really showed a big difference.
<HANNITY: I want to ask you -- and you did bring this up during the debate. I only want to play you one small clip of the Project Veritas videos, and it's about the flow of money to these operatives that admit and brag that they're fomenting and causing violence, even back in the Chicago incident in March, but also talking about a massive voter fraud plan that they have and they want to orchestrate. I want you to hear how the money flows and then respond to the two specific tapes. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)>
<UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am contracted with him, but I answer (INAUDIBLE) the head of special events for the DNC and the head of the special events and political (ph) for the campaign.>
<UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) DNC (INAUDIBLE) DNC (INAUDIBLE) Democracy Partners. Democracy Partners paid (ph) the Foval group. The Foval group goes and executes (EXPLETIVE DELETED). (END VIDEO CLIP)>
<HANNITY: All right, so let me read it. It says the campaign pays the DNC, the DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval group. They are the people bragging about fomenting violence at your events, inciting it. And they're the people that also talk at length about massive voter fraud in this election. And you came under heavy fire after the debate for saying, I'll keep you in suspense about accepting the election outcome. What is your reaction to these tapes?>
<TRUMP:> Sean, I've been saying for a long time it's a rigged system. It's totally -- it's just terrible, what's going on. And then the politicians play right along with it. I mean, you have 1.8 million people who are dead who are registered to vote, and some of them absolutely vote. Now, you know, tell me how they do that. There's only one way. But you have 2.5 million people or so that are registered in two states. That means they're voting twice. Look, we have a system. I'm a big believer in the system. I love our country. But I think I've done a great service by pointing this out, and a lot of people agree with what I'm saying. That I can tell you. But when you look at those tapes, it's disgusting. Our rally in Chicago -- that's where they were. They were there. And nobody could figure out what was going on. Where did these -- they're real thugs, by the way, real thugs. And injured policemen. They injured people. And they should be put in jail. I mean, these are bad people. And again, it's a rigged system. And who got blamed for it? Our rally people, us, me, everybody. <CROSSTALK>
<TRUMP:> It had nothing to do with us.
<HANNITY: Well, the Democratic operative overseeing this visited the Obama White House 342 times. What does that mean to you?>
<TRUMP:> Well, I think it's a disgrace, and I guess he saw the president 44 times, they say. Who knows? But I think it's disgraceful. Can you imagine, the one who was overseeing violence -- and this is a criminal act. You know, you -- I don't know if you saw the picture. Cops were leaving -- these policemen, these great people were leaving with massive gashes in their head from these people. These are professional thugs. They were being paid $1,500 a day, and they got cell phones out of it. No, this is a very serious problem. And I think come November 8th, I think we're going to win, and maybe we're going to win bigger than people ever even dreamed. When you look at Pennsylvania, you look at what's happening here, when you look at North Carolina where I just left, you look at Ohio, and you see what's happening -- you see what's happening with some of the jobs, the companies that are leaving our country and going to Mexico and other places. You see what's happening with ""Obama care,"" which is such a disaster! ""Obama care"" is a catastrophe! The premiums are going up 60, 70, 80 percent. The care is no good. You can't even get it. The deductible -- I mean, say what you want. Bill Clinton said this is the craziest thing I've ever seen. He said that.
<HANNITY: Yes.>
<TRUMP:> And he probably suffered... <CROSSTALK>
<TRUMP:> But he said Obama care is a disaster. It is a total disaster. <END VIDEO CLIP>
<HANNITY: And coming up, part two of my interview with Donald Trump, and I'll ask him about the Wikileaks revelations, plus the original insurgent, Patrick J. Buchanan, will joining us, and he is calling out the establishment saying they fear Donald Trump. And also later tonight... (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, SECRETARY >
<OF STATE: (INAUDIBLE) (END VIDEO CLIP)>
<HANNITY: There's Hillary Clinton caught on tape back in 2010 lecturing her staff at the State Department about the importance of cyber security. It's a video you've got to see to believe. That and more tonight right here on ""Hannity."" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (NEWSBREAK)>
<HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity,"" and here is part two of my interview with the 2016 Republican nominee, Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)>
<HANNITY: As I talk to you, I'm going to put up the headlines of Wikileaks and the things we've discovered, including the latest solicitation, $12 million from a country that Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, thought abusing their own citizens, $12 million, also a paid appearance to go to the Clinton Foundation. On the side of you right now is a list of all of these revelations. I know you've been paying attention to it. The media has not. They've largely ignored it. What does this tell you about the Clintons and about -- about the campaign and about their tactics? I mean, they would -- they even exposed how they would go after Obama and his father being a Muslim and that Obama used cocaine and going after Bernie Sanders, and of course, you. What do you get out of these Wikileaks revelations?>
<TRUMP:> Well, take a look at what's going on. I mean, look at -- as an example -- this wasn't Wikileaks, but look at what you just said about the voter fraud that was uncovered with the tapes. Look at what you said about the thugs going into arenas and starting problems. Look at what came out today about The New York Times, where they have reporters that are soft or safe or something. And I have those same reporters, and they are brutal. They're not brutal, they're dishonest. They're totally dishonest. It's, you know, totally dishonest group of people. And you just take a look at what's happened. Look at how you get set up. I mean, they say you saw somebody in 1902 and you touched the person. I mean, give me a break! This is stuff that all doesn't exist, Sean. This is dirty, disgusting stuff. And they'll find out. I'll be revealed at some point. This is dirty, disgusting stuff.
<HANNITY: Yes.>
<TRUMP:> And you know what? It's no way -- it's no way that it should be. We're supposed to be a great democracy. It's no way that it should be. I mean, a certain magazine wrote some horrible things. I guess it came out today. Nobody reports. I'm not going to get involved in it, but nobody reports it.
<HANNITY: Well, I actually reported it...>
<TRUMP:> But if somebody calls up the newspaper and says just one thing, they make a big deal out of it.
<HANNITY: Well, I mean, they interviewed a woman on CNN for 45 minutes! It turns out she's claiming you were molesting her on a plane, but it was OK for 15 minutes, and then an eyewitness came on with Judge Jeanine Pirro that said that never happened, I was sitting right next to them. And she was on a public plane with a lot of people. You would think she would have cried out for help, considering the length of time. They went with that, but you're right, they'll ignore The National Enquirer, which is what I think you're referring to.>
<TRUMP:> By the way, it never happened. Never happened.
<HANNITY: Right. Well... (CROSSTALK)>
<TRUMP:> Just so you understand, all that stuff, it was fabricated, made up, never happened. When you see -- they come, like, every two days. Never happened!
<HANNITY: How does CNN...>
<TRUMP:> Never, ever happened!
<HANNITY: How does CNN put the woman on for 45 minutes, and then the guy that was sitting next to you...>
<TRUMP:> I think it's a disgrace.
<HANNITY: ... they don't even ask him one question?>
<TRUMP:> It's the most rigged system I've ever seen. And I've been talking about it for a long time. And it was rigged against Bernie Sanders and it's rigged even more against me.
<HANNITY: Well...>
<TRUMP:> It's a disgrace.
<HANNITY: By the way...>
<TRUMP:> They poison -- they poison the voters with this kind of stuff and this kind of junk that never happened!
<HANNITY: Well, by the way...>
<TRUMP:> It's not like a question, like, it may have. It never -- none of it ever happened!
<HANNITY: Obama, Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders have all themselves at different points said it's a rigged system. But I don't have time to get into it now. I was glad to see the other night -- there's so much money that have come from countries, like the million-dollar gift from Qatar -- Qatar allows marital rape and martial beatings. The 25 -- up to $25 million to the Clinton Foundation from the Saudis, the $10 million from the Saudis from the Clinton library -- women can't drive. They're told how to dress. Gays and lesbians are killed. Christians and Jews are persecuted. But she takes the money. You want her to give it back. Has anybody in the media followed up on that?>
<TRUMP:> She should give it back. No, absolutely not. You're not surprised. But she should give that money back. I brought it up during the debate. Give the money back. It's $25 million at a minimum. Give the money back. She didn't want to answer that question, if you noticed.
<HANNITY: Yes, I did notice that. But I can -- how can you be the champion of women's rights, gay and lesbian rights, religious freedom and take money from countries that abuse all those groups?>
<TRUMP:> Sean, you have seen things and I've had -- I've seen things, and I've been going through this. I've never -- nobody could imagine that this could happen in the United States. Nobody can even imagine it. But I'll tell you what. We're going to win the election, and we're going to clean out the swamp. You know I'm using the expression, we're going to drain...
<HANNITY: Drain the swamp, yes.>
<TRUMP:> ... the swamp of Washington, D.C. It is a swamp of absolute corruption! It's absolutely corrupt! And we're going to drain the swamp. We'll see what happens. We're going to drain it. But we're going to win. We have such enthusiasm. And you saw what -- I just left this rally two minutes ago. In fact, I'm sitting in a room that's about 200 degrees. I've never seen it... <LAUGHTER>
<TRUMP:> It's like a steam room.
<HANNITY: I know (INAUDIBLE)>
<TRUMP:> And no, it's just wonderful. But I'll tell you what. At least you're on the side of, you know, exposing some of this stuff. The press doesn't want to do it. It's incredible what's going on in our country. But come November, if you watch -- you saw this arena. It was packed with thousands of people outside. Something is going on that's very, very special. Plus, three polls came out today, including Rasmussen, and including another poll that called it the most accurately four years ago. And they say I'm... <CROSSTALK>
<HANNITY: It's a 1-point lead. IBB, (sic) the Investors Business Daily TPP poll has you up by 1. They have been the closest in the last three cycles. I do think there are a lot of balls up in the air that haven't been factored into the polls yet, including the last debate, including the Project Veritas videos, including -- I don't think the public is absorbing what I'm showing them every night in terms of the Wikileaks reveals. All right, I know you've got to go. I want to ask you a final question. And give me as detailed an answer as you can. Tomorrow, you're going to make a pledge and put it on paper for the American people.>
<TRUMP:> Right.
<HANNITY: You're doing it in Gettysburg.>
<TRUMP:> Right.
<HANNITY: Give us a preview. What is this about? Is this like a ""Contract with America""?>
<TRUMP:> Sean, I want to do it tomorrow. I don't want to do it right now. I really want to do it tomorrow. I can only say we're going to make America great again. We have so many problems. Our taxes are too high. We're going to reduce them. Our borders are weak. Our regulations are crazy. Drugs are pouring into our country. People are coming into the country that we really shouldn't have come into the country. We have drug lords and criminals and murderers. And I mean, what's going on in this country is incredible. Hillary wants open borders where people can just flow through. We're not going to have a country anymore. We are going to do something very special, and tomorrow I think is going to be...
<HANNITY: All right...>
<TRUMP:> ... a special day at a special place.
<HANNITY: Did you have fun at the Al Smith dinner? Did you mind getting booed a little bit?>
<TRUMP:> I did. No, I -- look, we -- we say what's true, and some people don't like hearing it, but we say what's true.
<HANNITY: That's a pretty liberal crowd, though. (CROSSTALK)>
<TRUMP:> ... people in there.
<HANNITY: Yes, they...>
<TRUMP:> No, that's OK. It was a great dinner. It was a great dinner. No, I enjoyed it. I thought it was great.
<HANNITY: All right. Did you get in trouble when you went home to Melania last night?>
<TRUMP:> No, I didn't. She was great. She understood. It was -- that was probably the moment of the evening. People loved it.
<HANNITY: All right, Mr. Trump, have fun on the campaign trail. I know you got a lot more to get to today. Appreciate your time.>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you very much, Sean. <END VIDEO CLIP>
<HANNITY: And coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity""... (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)>
<TRUMP:> If Hillary Clinton gets elected, we've got four more years of Obama, we have a disaster! We have ISIS all over! <END VIDEO CLIP>

<CLINTON:> <INAUDIBLE> <END VIDEO CLIP>
<HANNITY: Well, that was Hillary Clinton back in 2010, talking to her staff at the State Department at the real importance of cyber security. Pretty hypocritical. Frank Luntz, Pat Caddell -- they're here with reaction and more as we continue to tonight on ""Hannity."" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)>
<TRUMP:> We have a bunch of babies running our country, folks. We have bunch of losers! They're losers! They're babies! We have a president, all he wants to do is campaign! His wife, all she wants to do is campaign! If Hillary Clinton gets elected, we've got four more years of Obama, we have a disaster. We have ISIS all over! <BOOS>
<TRUMP:> We won't win anymore. And your taxes are going up, and she wants to double up and triple up on ""Obama care,"" which has to be repealed and replaced. It's a disaster.

<TRUMP:> I don't think they're telling the truth, because when I look at all of the women at our rallies, I think we're gonna do very well with women for Trump. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> In 18 days we're going to win the state of North Carolina and we are going to win back the White House. <APPLAUSE> Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in history on this campaign. They've raised it from special interests and yet, we are leading in three recent polls that just came out over the last day. <APPLAUSE> Rasmussen, Los Angeles Times, and Investor's Business Daily, we're leading. And by the way, the last one as they tell me, the most accurate poll of the last cycle. So that's a good sign. That's a good sign. Because I honestly -- I believe we're going to win. This is what's going to happen. <APPLAUSE> We have two great Congressmen in the group, and they told me what's going on in their districts. It's unbelievable. Their areas unbelievable. Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee is here someplace. Where's Jimmy Duncan? Jimmy. Incredible guy. And he said, you won't believe what's happening in Tennessee. And Mark Meadows. Did you ever hear of Mark Meadows? <APPLAUSE> And much more importantly, his wife. The real leader in the family, right? Thank you Mark. Thank you for being here. Thank you both very much. These are great people, but they're just telling me the level of excitement and the people coming out -- I think we're going to have -- beyond the Brexit -- I think we're going beyond Brexit. You know about Brexit.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> I think we're gonna have it. Early voting is underway so make sure you send in your ballot. We cannot take a chance of blowing it. We can not take a chance. We have something, we're so close, it's a movement like they've never seen in this country before, never, ever seen. Don't blow it on November 8th. <APPLAUSE> Together we're going to deliver real change that puts America first. We're going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations -- so important... <APPLAUSE> And Hillary is going to raise your taxes big league, you've seen that. <BOOING> We're going to unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our veterans who have not been taken care of. <APPLAUSE> And of course, one of the true staples to my campaign, and I say to our campaign, repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. Your taxes will go way, way down under a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> Your companies won't be leaving North Carolina under a Trump administration. There will be consequences for that. We will be strong and a really strong and powerful nation again. Our military is so depleted. We're gonna build it up. America has grown weak, and so weak that the Philippines have broken with decades of pro-American foreign policy, to instead leave for the orbit of China and Russia. You saw that yesterday. The hatred -- I mean, why is Obama campaigning. He ought to be out working. He ought to be out... <APPLAUSE> I mean, I'm gonna send the Congressmen back to Washington with that message. But we'll send the real message on November 8th. Right? We'll send the real message on November 8th. <APPLAUSE> But every time I look at him he's campaigning. You see the Philippines. The heads of the Philippines -- they're so angry. He leaves for China, he's now negotiating with China. We've been in the Philippines practically forever. A very important strategic ally. And what happens? China and Russia are probably gonna take it, and I see him out there campaigning for crooked Hillary. Come on, come on. Give me a break. <BOOING> Strength will also require growth. Right now our economy isn't growing at all. We had only around one percent growth last quarter. GDP a disaster. You know, when China has one percent it's over, they don't have one percent. They have seven percent, that's considered terrible. India has eight percent, that's considered bad for them. They don't like it. We have one percent and everything's supposed to be fine. But we're going down. If Hillary gets in she's gonna raise your taxes and the one percent is going to be negative and that's going to be almost unheard of, but that's gonna happen.
<TRUMP:> I made a lot of predictions. If that happens, and if she gets in, you're gonna have such negative growth you will have problems like you've never had before, and our companies and our jobs will flee, believe me. I'm going to get us to 4 percent growth and create 25 million jobs over a 10-year period. <APPLAUSE> Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago. They're working harder and longer and they're making less. Some of them are working two jobs and even three jobs but still taking home less pay than they were taking home 18 and 20 years ago. But I'm working harder too, folks. I'm working harder, there's no doubt about it. I've got three stops today. We've got three of these today. We've got three. <APPLAUSE> You know, I've got three, on occasion I have four, I think I have one rest day where I have two -- but these are massive rallies and we're gonna do this for another 19 days. Right up until the actual vote of November 8th, and then I don't know what kind of shape I'm in but I'll be happy and at least I will have known, win, lose or draw, and I'm almost sure if the people come out we're gonna win. <APPLAUSE> But I will be, I will be happy with myself because I always say, I don't want to think back, ""If only I did one more rally I would have won North Carolina by 500 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes."" Right? If only I did. So I never, ever want to look back, I never want to say that about myself. We have to work, you have to get everybody you know out there. Companies like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. Ford is moving all of its small car production, announced two weeks ago, to Mexico. That's on top of a $2.5 million plant that they already built. When I'm president, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico or other parts of the world, there will be a tax of 35 percent for any product they want to ship in to this country... <APPLAUSE> ... and you know what's gonna happen? Because I'm a free trader. A lot of people don't believe that. I'm a free trader. But our politicians have made such horrible trade deals that they're killing our workers, they're killing our companies and our companies are being forced to move. Including the fact that taxes are so high. There will be consequences. And we're not gonna lose a company in North Carolina, have them go to Mexico or someplace else, make their products, sell it back in here -- which we will have a very strong border -- and there are no consequences. And I'll tell you what's gonna happen when we do this. For years our government has tried to stop our companies from leaving. Guess what's gonna happen? They're not gonna leave anymore. Because all of a sudden it won't work. If they do at least we're gonna make a lot of money when they ship their products across the border. OK? <APPLAUSE> The politicians -- you've never even heard of this. You've heard it from me over the last six months. For me it was so simple. You want to move, good luck. Enjoy the heat. But let me tell you. When you make your air conditioner, you make your car, you do this, you're gonna leave all those people unemployed -- there are consequences. You're gonna pay a tariff or a tax.
<TRUMP:> Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars and they're not leaving -- from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries, including millions of dollars from corporations and countries pushing for the next NAFTA. The next horrible trade deal, it's called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Don't let it happen, that will be the rest of your jobs will be gone. <BOOING> The rest of your jobs. That's how our system is corrupt and broken. We're going to take on big donors. We're going to take on big business and big media. That have enriched themselves at your expense. And I didn't need to do this folks. And I was part of the other side for a long time. I understand the game as well as anybody -- as well as anybody. But I saw the game, and I saw it first hand, and this country has been great to me. I love this country. And I said, our country will not survive if we continue to play that game. So this is always a tough thing to do, but I'm doing it. And I am so invigorated by the kind of reception. Look at this, to the corners of the room. <APPLAUSE> Make America great again. That's what we're going to do. It's all about making America great again. We're going to do it. And I understand it. I understand it from both sides, believe me. And I think you know that. Thank you. The media is so corrupt that Hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate. You remember this? Right? Just recently. Word for word, given the questions. Here are the questions. Here are the questions. Nobody gave me the questions. Now I don't know what I do. Would I turn the people in? Or would I take the questions? She was given the question. I think I'd turn them in, I think I'd say, wait a minute, what's going on over here? I want to know was she given the question to my debate. But it doesn't matter because we won. So... <APPLAUSE> Based on everything we won. I hope, that especially the last -- I think the first one, you know, was fine. I thought it was good. I mean, I never did this stuff before in all fairness. But I think we did well, I think it was good. They gave me this great commission on public, on presidential debates. They're wonderful, except they gave me a broken mic. But that's OK. I'm screaming into the mic all night. But I think the first one was fine. And I think we won easily the second one. And the third one was our best. Right? Third one? <APPLAUSE> But she was given the questions to a debate by Donna Brazile, who is now under pressure to resign. <BOOING> She should be, she should resign. But I ask you, why didn't Hillary say I can't do this? I can't do this. I can't take -- I can't take these questions. Nobody from the media is asking that question. Why is it, they're putting a lot of pressure on Donna Brazile, she was on television the other night. It was brutal. They're putting a lot of pressure on her. But tell me, she handed the questions to Hillary. Hillary read the questions, figured out the answers, put whatever she had to do. And then, why didn't she say I'm not allowed to do this?
<TRUMP:> Years ago, years ago, there was a show called ""The $64,000 Question."" Does anybody remember? Don't say it. Because it's old. Really? A contestant, go ahead, Charles, go ahead, what? Correct. How do you know it? Look how young this guy is. A contestant got the questions in advance, prior to the show. And his life was ruined. But Hillary got the questions in advance and the press doesn't even bring it up. Can you imagine if I got the questions in advance and they found out? <BOOING> Can you imagine if I got the questions and they found out? They would re-invent a much more sinister form of the electric chair, is that right? Yes. Yes. But I have to ask the press to find out why aren't they asking Hillary why she didn't turn in the people that gave her the answers. And those questions. <BOOING> But this is even bigger than what we're talking about, because we're playing for the presidency of the United States. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt politician ever to seek the office of the presidency. <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up.>
<TRUMP:> Let's do this. Let's do this. November 8th, let's win. Let's win. <APPLAUSE> Let's win. We win, we have lots of options. But we got to win. What a waste of time if we don't pull this off. You know these guys have said, ""It doesn't matter if you win or lose, there's never been a movement like this in the history of this country."" I say it matters to me whether we win or lose -- <APPLAUSE> -- so I'll have over $100 million of my own money in this campaign. So if I lose, if I lose, I will consider this -- and the nice part about saying that, and I only tell you that because that means I'm not taking all of this money from all of these people that Hillary Clinton's taking money -- <APPLAUSE> And you know her and her husband made $250 million. I said during the second debate, I said, ""So why aren't you putting $5 million, $10 million, $15 million, $25 million -- I'm putting in over a hundred, why aren't you putting in $10 million into your own campaign. They're not putting anything. And we're fighting this juggernaut because they have billions of dollars they've raised. And we're fighting -- I turned on the other day, I was in Florida, and I was in Pennsylvania -- I turned on the television. It was ad after ad after ad. Most of those ads were phony ads. Most of the things in those ads were false. They were false. I never said it, they know I didn't say it. They have different things. I won't go into things because my people go crazy. They say don't be particular, just -- I like to deny things. I like to <inaudible> because -- but they say oh talk about jobs. But these things are so false, all of these things are so false, are such lies. But Hillary -- it's ad after ad after ad, all paid for by Wall Street and special interests, all paid. And I'm saying to myself, ""I think they said in Florida the number of ads gonna be 50 to one, and we're tied in Florida and I think we're gonna win Florida."" <APPLAUSE> But the ads are phony ads, they're untrue, mostly untrue. There's a little truth in there, but mostly. And remember when you're watching television you see one of the thousands and thousands of ads, just remember put Wall Street on top. It's Wall Street. That's who paid for it or largely paid for it.
<TRUMP:> Now from Wikileaks we just learned she tried to get $12 million from the King of Morocco, for an appearance. More pay for play. <BOOING> That's why I'm proposing a path <ph> of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. <APPLAUSE> It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. <APPLAUSE> Those reforms include the following. A five-year ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service. <APPLAUSE> A lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. <APPLAUSE> Additionally I am going to push for a Constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. <APPLAUSE> Not only will we end government corruption but we will end economic stagnation. So important. Our country is doing poorly. My plan for the economy can be summed up in three great, beautiful, powerful words -- jobs, jobs, jobs. They've been taken away from us. <APPLAUSE> At the center of my jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals. They are terrible. They are the most incompetent deals ever made. By the way, NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton. Thank you very much, President Clinton. <BOOING> It's been a one-way highway into Mexico for our jobs, our cash. We get the drugs, they get the jobs and the cash, right? Forty-seven million Americans are living in poverty and 45 million Americans are right now, in this country, on food stamps. We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world and the worst so- called recovery since the Great Depression. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Half. You've lost half of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. A deal signed by Bill Clinton and strongly supported by Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> Listen to this. We've lost -- and I always say, it sounded like a typographical error. It's not -- I thought it would be 700, 7,000 -- we've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary backed deal. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Nobody's ever lost jobs like this. The deal that she made with South Korea was gonna bring us 100,000 jobs. No. It's brought them 100,000 jobs. We've lost jobs. We don't win anymore. By the way, to get jobs. We don't win on anything anymore. We attack a city -- Mosul. We attack Mosul. I've been reading about the attack for four months. The reason they want to attack it, a primary reason, is to take the leaders of ISIS out because that's where they think they are. And I say, whatever happened to a surprise attack? <APPLAUSE> So I've been reading about Mosul and the attack and I talked about it at the debate -- did everyone hear me talk about that during the debate?<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And I said to myself, ""How are you going to get these people"" -- these are tough, smart people. What you do is you do a sneak attack or a surprise attack, right? Right? <APPLAUSE> We're too predictable. ""We will attack Mosul. And three months from now, we are going to get their leaders, because we believe that that's where they're staying. We believe"" -- here's Obama -- ""we believe they are in Mosul, so in three or four months, let's see"" -- he does -- ""Three or four months, we will be attacking Mosul, because we want to get the leaders of ISIS."" OK. Well, in the meantime, the following day, they're out of there. They're spread all over the place. In the meantime, have you seen what's gone on? Much tougher than we thought. Because now they're dug in, they're ready. And it's much, much tougher than we thought. General Douglas MacArthur, General George Patton, who was too mean and too tough. Today he couldn't make it in the armed forces, because they'd say he's not politically correct. He had a very foul mouth. He used bad words. But his people loved him. And his people would die for him. But he had a foul mouth. But he won. He would win. Can you imagine him saying, ""We're going to be attacking Mosul in four months to see if we can get their leaders?"" And what they're finding is they're gone. I told them that four months -- what are you mentioning this for? Now, if they would have said, ""We will never ever attack Mosul. Mosul is"" -- no, I would never do this. Me, I would -- because I always like to tell the truth. But somebody could say, ""We will never, ever attack Mosul."" And then the next day you hit them like you've never hit anybody. <APPLAUSE> That would never do. I wouldn't. <APPLAUSE> I would not do it. We have a bunch of babies running our country, folks. <APPLAUSE> We have a bunch of losers. They're losers. They're babies. We have a president -- all he wants to do is campaign. His wife, all she wants to do is campaign. And I see how much his wife likes Hillary. But wasn't she the one that originally started the statement, ""If you can't take care of your home"" -- right? -- ""you can't take care of the White House or the country?"" Where's that? I don't hear that. I don't hear that. She's the one that started that. I said, ""We can't say that; it's too vicious."" Can you believe that? I said that. ""We can't say"" -- they said, ""Well, Michelle Obama said it."" I said, ""She did?"" Now, she said that, but we don't hear about that. Let me tell you, if Hillary Clinton gets elected, we've got four more years of Obama. We have a disaster. We have ISIS all over. <BOOING> We won't win anymore. And your taxes are going up. And she wants to double up and triple up on Obamacare, which has to be repealed and replaced. It's a disaster. A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up for <sic> foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country. <APPLAUSE> We are going to start making things in America again. We are going to start making things in North Carolina again.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We are bringing back our jobs. America first. Remember that. <APPLAUSE> In order to bring back manufacturing to North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and so many other places, we're going to undertake a major reform of our federal bureaucracy. American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury. And U.S. trade representative has -- doesn't know where he's going. My administration, under it, all trade policy will be consolidated into one office. It will report to a thing called the American Desk. And I'm gonna be calling every day like three times a day, ""How are we doing American Desk?"" American Desk. <APPLAUSE> The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interest of the American worker and the national interest of the United States. We are losing our manufacturing all over the country. North Carolina's been hit hard -- almost the hardest. But we've been losing it all over the country, folks. It's coming back, and it's gonna come back fast. And they'll be a day soon -- soon. During my administration -- four years, eight years, doesn't matter -- it's coming back soon. Where Apple and other companies like Apple are going to start making their product in our country not in China and Vietnam and all over the <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> America first. As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> We're also going to rebuild our inner cities. African Americans and Hispanics living in inner cities are suffering gravely. You walk through these places and you're with your child and you get shot. There's no education. There are no jobs. There's no safety. Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since January 1. You believe that? 3,500. That's worse than these war zones we're talkin' about. Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and more than 60 percent in Baltimore. And the murder rate in the United States is the highest it's been in 45 years. And the dishonest media, they never tell you that. <BOOING> And it's getting worse. <BOOING> So, the conditions are terrible, and I say to the African American community and to the Hispanic community, and voters, what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it. I will fix it. <APPLAUSE> I will fix it. And the Democrats have been taking advantage of the African American community and the Hispanic community for years. They get their vote and then they say we'll see you in four years. They don't do a damn thing for 'em. We're gonna fix it. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna make lives much better in this country for everybody. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country we must also be a safe country. Our national security at the border is a mess, very unsafe, very terrible situation. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, I will build the wall. I promise. <APPLAUSE> Speaking in secret to a foreign bank.
<TRUMP:> Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally open trade -- there goes your business -- and open borders -- there goes your country. There goes your <inaudible>. <BOOING> Oh, we love WikiLeaks. Boy, they have really -- WikiLeaks! They have revealed a lot. <APPLAUSE> They've revealed that there is a great hostility toward Catholics. They've revealed that there is a great hostility toward Evangelicals. Any Evangelicals in the audience? <APPLAUSE> Well, I've done great with Evangelicals, including here, where we won our primary big. But the Evangelicals and the Catholics and people of faith, I think they are going to be voting for us bigly. I think they're going to be voting for us... <APPLAUSE> Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East. Meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within ours shores. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> It's unbelievable. They're letting people come in from Syria and Hillary Clinton wants to increase it by 550% and already thousands and thousands. <BOOING> This will be in Trojan horse. Remember this. And we don't want to be the generation, we do not want to be the people that in 200 years people are laughing at for allowing it to happen. We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders.. Without borders, we do not have a country, folks. We do not have a country. <APPLAUSE> We will build a wall and Mexico will pay for the wall. Believe me. <APPLAUSE> Mexico has done very well on our back; they will pay for the wall. They're making a tremendous amount of money off of us. You have to see the -- the lines -- I was in Laredo, Texas. You have to see the lines and lines, miles long of trucks pouring into Mexico and it's a one-way street, folks. It's a one-way street. It's -- going to stop. And I was with the president of Mexico three months ago. Great guy, really had a great meeting. But it cannot go on like this. They can't continue to outsmart our politicians and if it is me, they're not going to outsmart us <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> We have the first ever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers. First ever. First time they've ever endorsed. <APPLAUSE> And Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back because they're smart. They don't want to take back killers and drug dealers and all of the people that we're sending back. It was just reported, and Hillary took it -- she said, all right, look, bring them back, bring them back. They won't take them. Bring them back. We do not want to disturb one of these <inaudible>, right, that we practically support. We don't want to <inaudible>. Believe me. We're going to take these people out day one, the people that are the criminals, which is drug lords, gang members, etc. -- killers. We're bringing them back to their countries.
<TRUMP:> There will not be one foreign country that will not say thank you Mr. President for sending him back. Thank you, sir. They will be so happy to get then. And I don't mean that exactly, but the point is they're going to be taking them back. They're not coming back to us. That I can <inaudible>. Can you imagine? She didn't want to make waves, she didn't want to make waves. So we have these people, thousands, all over our streets and our cities. It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year-old girl. In August, Texas police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist, who'd been deported five times. His victims included one 68- year-old woman with a cane, who took his offer to drive her home. Raped her. He left her on the side of a dirt road. Horrible, horrible condition. The 65-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported many times, but never was. What kind of a government allows its citizens to suffer such horrors? Take a look at Remembrance -- Remembrance -- remind? Remembrance Project. These are great mothers and fathers and people who have lost their loved ones to illegal immigration. Take a look, Remembrance Project. You will never see anything so sad in your lives, and for no reason. Either we win this election, or we're going to lose our country. A victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people. <APPLAUSE> In closing.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, thank you. In closing, here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country, starting in 2017. Very positive stuff. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, perhaps even bigger. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job- killing regulation. We're going to defend religious liberty. Very important. We're going to provide school choice for every low income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core. <APPLAUSE> Disaster. We're <ph> bringing <ph> our education <inaudible>. We're going to be supporting the men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to appoint Justices to the United State Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> You have 18 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your children, for your relatives, for your friends, for your country, to come true. Our campaign is powered by a love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. We're in a divided country now. There's going to be love. There's going to be love. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.
<TRUMP:> I'm going to fight for every citizen of every background, from every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I am going to fight for African-Americans who have not been treated fairly. <APPLAUSE> I am going to fight for every mom who lost a child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence. You take a look. It is a huge epidemic. I am going to fight for every community whose jobs in factories have been ripped out of the states like North Carolina and shipped all over the world to Mexico and other countries but all over the world. I am going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> I am going to fight to bring us all together as a nation. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together and we will as one people under one God saluting one American <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> You are going to look back at this rally in 10 years, in 20 years, in 40 years, you're going to look back for the rest your life. You are going to remember this day. This is a movement like people in this country and throughout the world have never ever seen before. <APPLAUSE> Eighteen days, you are going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time. <APPLAUSE> Because starting in 2017, we are going to start winning again and you are going to start being really, really proud of your country. We don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again. <APPLAUSE> We are going to start winning again. We're going to make America wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We are going to build up our depleted military and take care of the greatest people on earth and we are going to take care of truly the greatest people on earth are veterans. We are going to take care of our veterans. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you, everybody. <APPLAUSE> Get out and vote. Thank you. God bless you. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-21"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That's a great honor. Boy, what a crowd. <APPLAUSE> We've been all over today, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and we have had crowds you wouldn't believe it. Congressman Duncan from Tennessee said the greatest thing he's ever seen -- he's never seen anything like this. And I'll tell you what, it's really been -- it's really been a great honor. And in 18 days, we are going to win the state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win the White House. <APPLAUSE> But you have to get out November 8th. You have to get out -- you just have to get out and vote. Otherwise, we've all wasted a lot of time and energy. I've wasted time, energy and money. So you've got to get out. We've got to turn this thing around. What's going on in our country today is a disgrace. Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns raised from special interests, and yet, we're leading in polls from Rasmussen to the L.A. Times to Investor's Business Daily... <APPLAUSE> Leading nationwide, leading -- just came out, just came out. We're leading nationwide. Together, we're going to deliver real change that puts America first. <APPLAUSE> We're going to renegotiate our terrible, absolutely terrible, horrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes big league, cut regulations bigly, end Common Core, bring our education local... <APPLAUSE> ... and repeal and replace Obamacare. Disaster. <APPLAUSE> Your premiums are going up 70, 80, 90 percent and it's only going to get worse. And Hillary Clinton wants to do it more so. <BOOING> We're going to repeal it, we're going to replace it with something much better at a fraction of the cost. Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> Your companies won't be leaving Pennsylvania under a Trump administration, that I can tell you. There will be consequences. <APPLAUSE> We're also going to rebuild our badly depleted military. We have the greatest people on Earth, but they've let it go. Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I. My plan will be to build 350 ships. We need a 350-ship Navy. It's much lower than that right now, smallest since World War I. Can you believe that? This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan and it will require a truly national effort and do we need that or what? <APPLAUSE> The Philadelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example. I went to school in Philadelphia. I know Philadelphia very well. <APPLAUSE> I will instruct my secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant, private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort. It'll happen. <APPLAUSE> As our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsman. That we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so many more, people that don't have jobs, the greatest people. We'll establish centers of excellence in places like Philadelphia and Port Smith, New Hampshire and Hampton Rhodes, Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our fleet and many other things. <APPLAUSE> We will rebuild our Navy and we will do it with American steel made right here in Pennsylvania. <APPLAUSE> And you see what's happened to our steel industry <inaudible>.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> As part of our plan for bold change to make your life better, we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure; our roads, our bridges, our tunnels. It's all falling apart. We have $20 trillion in debt and our roads and infrastructure are a disaster. Obama-Clinton doubled the national debt in eight years. But instead of rebuilding America, the money was all lost and America's infrastructure is like that of a third-world country. We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East and it's in far worse shape now than it was 15 years ago, think of it. We spent $6 trillion. We could have rebuilt our country two times over. Imagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of Philadelphia. Instead, we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our towns and cities to crumble. How smart are our politicians. These are stupid people, stupid people. <APPLAUSE> We defend other countries' borders, invest in their resources, but abandoned their own. Think of it. We fight for other countries' borders, and yet our body is like a sieve, like water pours through. <BOOING> We'll have strong borders. We're going to have the wall, don't worry about the wall. We're going to have the wall, that I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> We will build the wall and who is going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> That's right. <APPLAUSE> They may not know it yet; they're paying for the wall. <APPLAUSE> And I met with the president of Mexico, nice guy, two months ago and we had a good meeting. Just the beginning, but we had a very good meeting, believe me. And it's very unfair. We have a highway that goes right into Mexico. They're taking our plants, they're taking our jobs, they're taking so much. We've lost so much. Look at Philadelphia. Look at Pennsylvania. Look at what's happened to Pennsylvania, the jobs. Look at the steel industry in Pennsylvania. It was the greatest in the world and now it's not so good. It's going to be good again; it's going to be great again, not good; it's going to be great again. <APPLAUSE> The plan I'm proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix America's transportation, drinking water and other vital infrastructure. This can be achieved through a focus on public-private partnerships, proven financing programs and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job and wealth-producing investments in your local economies. It should be done. <APPLAUSE> This means help for projects like the Pennsylvania turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania portion of the Appalachian highway system. It needs help, needs help, not in good shape. Amazing what it looks like now compared to 10 or 15 years ago, isn't it? Look at your whole lives compared to 10 or 15 years ago. My plan will also help Pennsylvania upgrade, replace bridges in the commonwealth that have been deemed structurally deficient. It's amazing what percentage are structurally deficient. I said before sometimes, you just want to swim and just relax and swim across the river, get there safely. <LAUGHTER> Some are very, very dangerous. We're also going to unleash -- thank you; I love you too. <APPLAUSE> He sounds like a rough guy, but I love him. In my own way, I love him. We're also going to unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania; shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal, clean coal. <APPLAUSE> We're going to put our miners back to work, folks. And we're putting Pennsylvania back to work. And we're going to put the special interests -- and who knows more about special interest than me? But we're going to put them out of work. We're going to renegotiate NAFTA, stop the TPP, which is a disaster, and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation that make it impossible for your companies to compete. <APPLAUSE> Your city has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, a deal strongly supported by Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> Listen to this number, and I've been saying it's a typo; 70,000 -- not 7,000 or 700 or seven -- 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States since China entered the World Trade Organization. <BOOING> That was another Clinton mess. And 100,000 jobs have been lost since she produced the deal, the great deal with South Korea. <BOOING> Just a few miles from here, there's a very famous bridge that says Trenton Makes the World Tanks. <APPLAUSE> Under a Trump administration, I can promise you we are going to start making things in America again. We are going to start making things in Pennsylvania again. <APPLAUSE> Your products will be sent around the world, not your jobs. Right now, your jobs are dissipated. We're going to start making things again. Do you remember it used to say Made in the USA or Made in America? Where do you see that anymore? You don't see it. Hillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries. <BOOING> She's the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency of the United States. <APPLAUSE> She bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after getting a congressional subpoena, lied under oath to Congress, lied to the FBI, obstructed justice, made 13 iPhones disappear, some with a hammer. And now, we just learned that two boxes of evidence are mysteriously missing. <BOOING> And we just had a four-star General, highly respected, General Cartwright, you heard what happened yesterday. He could go to jail for five years because he supposedly told a lie to the FBI, one lie. <BOOING> And I don't know that it was even a lie. I don't know that our General Cartwright -- this is a four-star general. This happened yesterday. Could go to jail for five years. And there have been nothing but lies to the FBI. Now from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million from the king of Morocco for an appearance, one appearance. More pay for play. <BOOING> That's why I'm proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Is there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally, right?
<AUDIENCE: No! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> One new proposal I'm outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business. They are killing your steel. They are killing your energy. They're really, really hurting our country. And we need regulation. We need regulation for safety and we need regulation for the environment. But we don't need what's happening with the regulation industry, that I can tell you. I will work with Congress to require that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. <APPLAUSE> We're losing $2 trillion in economic activity a year to regulations. The only people getting rich are the lobbyists, the lawyers and the special interests. I'm also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all of our members of Congress. It's time. <APPLAUSE> Not only will we in government -- well, do you think it's time?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> Right? Not only will we end government corruption, but we'll end economic stagnation. My plan lowers are business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent and lowers taxes for everybody straight across the board, everybody as individuals, and simplifies our tax code. <APPLAUSE> We're also going to rebuild our inner cities. African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbelievable and unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There's no education. There are no jobs. There's no safety. Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since January 1st, the beginning of the year. Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and more than 60 percent in Baltimore and it's getting worse. Murder in the United States is up more, think of it, is up more than at any time over 45 years, the highest level in 45 years. You don't hear that from these dishonest people back there, meaning the media. Look at them, look at them, the most dishonest people. <BOOING> They are the most dishonest people. They are dishonest people.
<AUDIENCE: CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!>
<TRUMP:> We're living in a rigged system, and believe me, they're a big part of the rigging, those people, believe me. They don't tell the truth. <BOOING> So to the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering in inner cities and other places that are so riddled with crime, with no jobs, with no education or very poor education, I say what do you have to lose? I will fix the inner cities. I will fix education. We will bring back jobs. We will make the inner cities safe. <APPLAUSE> Some of the inner cities are as dangerous as the war zones you read about in the Middle East. We will do a great job. We will also make our nation rich again. We have to do that. We have to do that. <APPLAUSE> But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. National security begins at the border. <APPLAUSE> Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally open trade and open borders and she denied it. <BOOING> And she denied it the other night in the debate. But she turned out to be wrong. Who won the debate?
<AUDIENCE: You!>
<TRUMP:> That one -- honestly, that was not close. Except for a couple of dishonest groups, they would say, oh I think she won, I think she -- give me a break. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores, not good. She even wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees over Obama's numbers to come pouring into our country. <BOOING> She wants 500 -- think of it, 550 percent more than the thousands that are already coming in. The great white horse, you watch folks, it's a great white horse. So let me state very clearly the fact that if I'm elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorism the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Boy, what spirit. Pennsylvania, I love Pennsylvania. <APPLAUSE> I got a good education in Pennsylvania, my kids got a good education in Pennsylvania. Smart people in Pennsylvania, tough and smart and sharp and people that don't like what's happening to their country, that's who's in Pennsylvania, I'll tell you. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders, believe me. And yes, we will build the wall. <APPLAUSE> We have the honor of being the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers; 16,500 Border Patrol and ICE just last week endorsed us. They've never endorsed a presidential candidate, never. It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year-old girl. <BOOING> In August, Texas police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times. One victim included a 68-year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road in absolutely horrible, horrible condition. <BOOING> A 64-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Ferris, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat offending criminal illegal immigrant who should've been deported many times, but never was under the Obama administration. <BOOING> If I'm elected, we will impose tough new mandatory minimum federal prison sentences for anyone who illegally reenters the country after previously being deported. They won't come back. <APPLAUSE> And we will swiftly remove and deport all criminal aliens from this country; the gang members, the drug lords. We've got some bad dudes and they're preying on our citizens and that's not going to happen. It's going to be one of the first things we do. Either we win this election or we lose the country. And believe me, this is the last time we are going to have a chance to win. This is it, folks. This is it. It's the last time. <APPLAUSE> A victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people, and that's what it is. I didn't need to do this. I didn't need to do this. It's a lot of work. I didn't need it, but I'm doing it. And I know the other side. I've been on the other side for a long time, I know it. But I also saw that this country was going bad. It was going in the wrong direction, just going in the wrong direction. I love our country and we're going to pull it off. We're going to make it great again. We're going to make America great again. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Here are some of the amazing things we're going to be doing for our country starting in 2017. We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. Hillary Clinton is going to raise your taxes a lot. She's going to raise your taxes. That came out loud and clear in the debate, going to raise your taxes. We're going to lower your taxes bigly, not only the business taxes, we're lowering everybody's. We're simplifying the code. Who knows the code better than me? We're simplifying the code. We're simplifying the code. The only one that's going to do badly is H&amp;R Block. They won't do so well. They're not going to be so happy. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We are going to defend religious liberty, which is under siege, under siege. <APPLAUSE> Religious liberty is under siege. We are going to provide school choice to every low-income child in America and we are going to end Common Core. <APPLAUSE> We're going to support the great men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We will save the Second Amendment, also under siege. <APPLAUSE> We're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> For the next 18 days, you have to get every last person you know out to the voting booths. You have to do it or we've wasted so much, November 8th. This is our one magnificent chance to reclaim our country, the country we love for we the people. <APPLAUSE> I am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation. I am going to fight for every child living in poverty. I am going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence, and that's a lot of people and these are great people. <APPLAUSE> The Remembrance Project, think about the Remembrance Project. Look it up, credible people. I am going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of our states like Pennsylvania and shipped to Mexico and other countries all over the world. That's not happening anymore. <BOOING> I am going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. <APPLAUSE> I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. We're a divided nation. We are going to be a nation of spirit. We are going to love everybody. There's love in this room. We're going to love everybody. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> You are going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You are going to remember this day in 10 and 20 and 30 years from now. This is a movement like you and the media have never, ever seen before. There has never been anything like this. <APPLAUSE> Too bad they won't write and speak honestly about it. It would actually make for much better television. You're going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time. You're going to be proud of your country again. We're going to make great deals and bring back jobs. We're going to have a strong military. We're going to take care of our great veterans. We're going to take care of our veterans. <APPLAUSE> If we win, the change you've been waiting for will finally arrive, just remember. We're going to do so much. And remember the inner cities, the African-American community, just remember what I'm saying. We will do such a great job. Those communities have been ruled by Democrats for in some cases over 100 years unbroken. We will do such a great job. We have to get everybody together. We have to get out and vote. We're going to have -- believe me, this is Brexit times five; you watch what's going to happen. <APPLAUSE> We will make American wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. I love you. God bless you. God bless you. November 8th, get out and vote, November 8th. Thank you, everybody.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-10-31"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you, Coach. Boy, oh boy. <APPLAUSE> He's something, Coach Knight. <APPLAUSE> No games, right? With him there's no games. Thank you, Coach. Thank you, General. What a combination those two are right? <APPLAUSE> Boy this is a great group. You know, we set this up about 24 hours ago, because I hear we're going great in Michigan -- we're gonna win Michigan. <APPLAUSE> We're doing great in every poll, I mean we're doing amazing. <APPLAUSE> We're winning in Ohio. We're winning in Iowa. We're winning in North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> We're winning in Florida.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We're winning big in Texas -- you know, they were saying Texas is -- Texas is setting new voting records. We're winning all over the place, folks. This is going to be something special. In eight days we're going to win the great state of Michigan... <APPLAUSE> ... and we are going to win back the White House. One hundred percent. Let me start today by making a very important promise to you. When I win on November 8th, I am going to bring your jobs back to America. <APPLAUSE> You know it better than anybody else in this country. The long nightmare of jobs leaving Michigan will be coming to a very rapid end. We're going to make Michigan the economic envy of the entire world once again, it used to be the economic envy. <APPLAUSE> The political class in Washington has betrayed you. They've uprooted your jobs, your communities and they've shipped your wealth all over the world, to Mexico, and all over. They put up new skyscrapers in Beijing, while your factories in Michigan were crumbling. These we're our politicians. I will end the theft of American prosperity, believe me. <APPLAUSE> I will fight for every last Michigan job -- you're going to have plenty of jobs get ready. <APPLAUSE> Because when we win it's going to be America first. <APPLAUSE> So, you have to make sure you get in your absentee ballots and get out to the polls on November 8th. You have to get those ballots in. Anybody send in their ballot, anybody? <APPLAUSE> All right, big thing November 8th. We'll never have another chance to do this again, you know we've created a movement, this is like a great movement, that the whole world is talking about. And honestly you'll never have this chance, in four years, I don't care who it is that runs, your never gonna have this chance. So you have to get out and vote. Vote with all of your heart, vote with all of your soul, because this is it. Show the whole world how much you love Michigan and how much you love America by voting. So that we take back our jobs and we re-build our military and we do so many other things including border, we've gotta have a border. <APPLAUSE> I'm asking for your vote.
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!>
<TRUMP:> We will build the wall, do not worry about it. <APPLAUSE> Do not worry. <APPLAUSE> We don't build a wall, Bobby Knight is going to be very angry at me, so we're gonna build the wall. And you know what else, you know who is paying for the wall, right?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> One hundred percent. They don't quite know that yet, but they're going to find out. No, they're good. I met with the president of Mexico, a couple of months ago, he was great, the whole thing is going to work out, but we are going to have to have a wall. We have to stop the poison from blowing in. You know the poison, the drugs, they're flowing in, they are poisoning your state. They are poisoning New Hampshire. New Hampshire tells me an -- for a year and a half they have been telling me stories, unbelievable. But, every state, the poison is pouring in and we're gonna stop the drugs, we're gonna stop those drugs fast. Then we are going to work on the people that are so badly addicted. We're gonna get them better. I'm asking for the vote of Republicans, Democrats, Independents and first time voters who want great jobs, safe neighborhoods and a government that works for the people. <APPLAUSE> I am asking you so importantly, to believe in America once again. But to bring back your jobs, we must also must immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> What a disaster. <APPLAUSE> It's just been announced that Michigan residents are going to experience crushing double-digit premium hikes, congratulations -- congratulations. <BOOING> In fact a number is so high, I don't want to give it to you 'cause I want you to have a good time today, OK? I don't want to ruin your day, I'll just see you sort of slump out of here, no. By the way, any place more fun to be than a Trump rally?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> And honestly, the subject right now isn't so positive because it's what's going on with our country. But we're going to make it so positive -- we're going to make it so positive. In Minnesota, where the premium -- I mean, you have to see what happens in Minnesota, but the increase is over 60 percent. The Democratic governor has said -- and he's a big Democrat -- the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. He took a little heat for that. Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, make it even more expensive. In fact, much more expensive than ever before, she's gonna double down. In all fairness though folks -- based on what we're reading -- in all fairness I think right now, she has bigger problems than Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> And they finally have gotten wise to the Clintons, perhaps they've finally gotten wise.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> Wow. Thank you. I love you, too. <APPLAUSE> And I have to give the FBI credit, that was so bad what happened originally, and it took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made, in light of the kind of opposition he had, where they're trying to protect her from criminal prosecution, you know that. It took a lot of guts, I really disagreed with him, I was not his fan. But I'll you what he did, he brought back his reputation -- he brought it back. He's got to hang tough, because there's a lot of -- a lot of people want him to do the wrong thing. What he did was the right thing. I'm asking for your vote so that we can replace Obamacare and save the healthcare -- and look, the healthcare in this country, is in such dire straits. We are going to save healthcare for every family in Michigan, for every family in our country. <APPLAUSE> Much less expensive, much better healthcare. Repeal and replace. We have so many alternatives, so much better, so much less expensive. Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. <APPLAUSE> As you know, the FBI has re-opened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and discovered... <APPLAUSE> ... and discovered -- you heard this yesterday -- it's hard to believe -- and discovered another 650,000 e-mails. She lied under oath when she turned over all of her work related e-mails. Just one more lie out of so many. And you know, General Cartwright, a four- star general, lied one time -- and I think he did it actually for national security purposes. He lied one time, he may go to jail for five years . She's lied so many times and the deletions. This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. Hillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she has brought all of this on herself. Hillary is the one who set up any legal private e-mail server, in a closet, to shield her illegal activity. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay-for-play scheme at the State Department. And now there are five FBI probes into the Clinton foundation and their pay-for-play activities, very, very deep investigations. Hillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server, putting the safety of the American people under threat. That's what she did. <BOOING> Six-hundred-and-fifty thousand -- you know, what I call that? That's the mother load. That's the -- I think you're gonna find the 33,000 that are missing, the 15,000 that are missing, the bats <ph> that are missing two weeks ago. You know, they had boxes of e-mails missing two weeks ago? I think we hit the mother load, as they say in the good old mining industry. <APPLAUSE> Hillary is the one who lied to Congress under oath. Hillary is the one who lied on so many different occasions to the FBI, and they know --they know. They know Hillary's the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. Hillary is the one who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after she got the subpoena, after. Before it's no good, but after, no; that's why something should've happened then, but that's OK. Hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again. We can be sure that what is in those e-mails is absolutely devastating and I think we're gonna find out, by the way, for the first time. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, Huma. Thank you, Huma. Good job, Huma. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, Anthony Weiner. <APPLAUSE> And you all saw the statements I made him a year ago -- about him a year ago. You know, in New York we knew <ph> Weiner. And I made statements that were rough, like how can she be allowed to live with this guy, how can she have access to this important information. And I was badly criticized, right? Now, they're saying oh, Trump has good judgment, wow. <APPLAUSE> Got good instincts, I have good instincts. <APPLAUSE> Hillary is not the victim. The American people are the victims of this corrupt system in every way. And this is your one chance, right now, November 8th to change it. <APPLAUSE> Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a very long time. One of her long time supporters, a top Democratic pollster, good guy, smart guy, sharp guy, Doug Schoen is now totally withdrawing his support. He's supported their family for years. <APPLAUSE> He wrote in an article -- he wrote in an article quote, ""I'm a Democrat. I worked for Bill Clinton. But I can't vote for Hillary."" And this is so important, Schoen writes, ""I'm now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious,"" and we all know that, ""consequences should Secretary Clinton win the election."" Now, I don't think that's gonna happen so hopefully. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> That happens, we did a bad job out here, folks. Schoen warns that if Hillary is elected, she would be under protracted criminal investigation and probably a criminal trial, I will say. So we'd have a criminal trial for a sitting president. In the meantime, Putin -- who she likes to say bad things about -- and all of the other leaders, many of whom she says bad things about, then you wonder why the world hates us. But all of these people will sit back and they will laugh and they will smile. The investigation will last for years. The trial would probably start, nothing will get done, I can tell you your cars will continue to leave Michigan. Your car production facilities, like the Ford facility, will continue to leave Michigan, nothing's gonna get done. Our country will continue to suffer. She's unfit and unqualified to be the president of the United States and her election... <APPLAUSE> Would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis that we cannot afford, folks, we have to get back to work, we have to get back to work. <APPLAUSE> We need to be going to work for the American people, we can't do what Hillary would like to do and that's become president. You can't take it, I can't take it, nobody can take it. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, we do not need four more years of Obama that I can tell you right now, that, I can tell you. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> Four more years of ISIS running wild. Four more years of no borders, four more years of losing all of your jobs, four more years of a depleted military, we're not building up our military for the great people in our military. Hillary -- that's right. Hillary Clinton's corruption... <AUDIENCE MEMBER>: Eight more days!
<TRUMP:> Eight days, you're right. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Is a threat to democracy and the only way to save our democracy is to get our and vote by the millions, by the millions. Don't leave it to chance. <APPLAUSE> We're all hearing about our system is too honorable, it's to honest -- both <ph> right, they say it's so honest, it's so honest that you can name 10 places, so can I. But you hear so much about the honesty. Let's do this, let's not worry about it, get out and vote by the millions and we won't have to worry about what's taking place behind the scenes. <APPLAUSE> Remember this, 1.8 million people that are dead are registered to vote. You know, they talk about oh, that's a threat to democracy what I'm saying, 1.8 million people, 2.75 million people are registered to vote in two states. So they vote here, they go to another state, they vote there. There's so many things going on folks. And Obama the other day on television, talk to you about the bedrock of our foundation and this is going to be so. But the other day, eight years ago when he was running for the first time, he essentially was talking about how corrupt the election system is in Chicago. I saw it. I said wait a minute, he's telling us how Trump shouldn't be saying these things and this guy, eight years ago, is on television last night, talking about how corrupt it is and saying I'm lucky I'm from Chicago. In other words, its corrupt, it's corrupt. He's lucky he's the beneficiary of the corruptness. Folks, get out and vote by the millions so they can't do anything. We can't let them take it away. <APPLAUSE> The Clinton crime spree ends on November 8th, it's gonna end on November 8th. And when we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter, focused on the American people. <APPLAUSE> So we wanna now be a little uplifting because you know what? We have such tremendous potential, tremendous potential in our country. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability in our government. <APPLAUSE> I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are about to say, get ready. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp, we're gonna drain the swamp. <APPLAUSE> And speaking of draining the swamp, Donna Brazile did it again, WikiLeaks today. She gave the questions to a debate to Hillary Clinton and that was from a couple of weeks ago. Happened again, but this time far worse; she gave the questions to a debate to Hillary Clinton. Now, they're all blaming Donna Brazile and frankly, I think she just got fired from the network. <APPLAUSE> She should be fired from the DNC. By the way, could you imagine if I did that? Bobby, what would happen to be if I did that? Electric chair, I think, the electric chair. If I did that, can you imagine? So Donna Brazile got fired from the network but here's the real problem, uh oh. <APPLAUSE>
<UNKNOWN: I wanna ask you, all of you folks that have been -- excuse me -- in any branch of the military, male or female or you have had sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, that have been in the military. How many of you have done that, raise your hand. (APPLAUSE) I wanna tell you that there will be no president that has ever been closer or who has ever had a greater respect for our military people than Donald Trump will have. (APPLAUSE) There's nothing more important in today's world than our military, Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, whatever, gets everything it needs to have. And this man will assure that that is done. I guarantee you that. (APPLAUSE) Now, you've listened to him, you've heard him talk. He has got a couple more things to say. I'm running out of things, but I'm going to tell you one thing. In a Donald Trump administration, there will be no bullshit. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> There's only one. There's only one Bobby Knight.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you, Bobby. Thank you. What a great place to be. Thank you, Bobby. And you know, we also have the endorsement of a great, great guy, Jack Nicklaus. Jack Nicklaus. You talk about winners, Jack is such a winner, Bobby is such a winner. We have so many endorsements. We have so many endorsements from such great, great winners. We love Jack. At the core of our contract is my plan to bring back your jobs. Michigan has lost more than one in four manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, a deal strongly supported by Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160 thousand, and believe me, it's going down and going down fast. Our country has lost -- listen to this -- 70,000 factories, 70,000, Bobby. Do you heard that? Seventy-thousand. I thought it was 700, I thought it was 7,000 -- 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill -- that was another Bill and Hillary disaster. We get nothing. He said what do we get? We get -- we get loss and unemployment. We have nearly $800 billion in annual trade deficits with the world, $800 billion. We do all of this trade. We have a trade deficit of $800 million. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world and the people of Michigan, perhaps almost more than any other place, know that. Our trade deficit with China grew almost 40 percent during Hillary's tenure as secretary of State. It's massive. Her trade deal with South Korea, you know all about that one, she was pushing it so hard. Instead of making 100,000, it killed 100,000 American jobs. So when you look around Michigan and you see the rusted out factories, the empty buildings and the long unemployment lines, remember, Hillary Clinton did much of this to you. She wasn't there. And during the debates, you watch the debates -- did I win the debates, by the way? <APPLAUSE> The debates. I love those debates. But you know, I watch <inaudible> I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that. I say Hillary, you've been there for 30 years, why didn't you do it? She'd say, ""I'm going to change the tax code so that Donald Trump can't do that."" Well, what she doesn't say is all of her donors are doing the same thing. But I said to her, ""I don't mind if you do that, then change the code, why don't you do it?"" Nothing gets done. The reason she'll never do it is because her donors don't want it done, OK? And I'll have over $100 million in my campaign, which means $100 million of people that aren't giving me money. I will tell you this, on the internet, people -- $61 average. Sixty-one dollars. We're setting records, setting records. <APPLAUSE> It's amazing. Hillary got rich selling your jobs to the same special interests who pushed the jobs out of America, are the people who have given countless millions to her. She's not gonna change. Hillary gets rich making America poor. Look at the devastation here. Delphi laid off 3,627 workers. You know that. And you know where they moved? Different places. Most of those jobs went to Mexico. By the way, Mexico's doing very well. If she's working for Mexico, I think she's doing a great job. We're going to fight for the workers at Delphi. Anybody here from Delphi? A few? They don't want to raise their hand. This guy had his hand sort of partially up. Are you -- he was like ""Uh."" In other words -- don't worry, you'll be proud of it very soon. They got a raw deal and they deserve better. GM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion assembly plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed by Hillary. That was her baby. Lear Corporation laid off many people in Rochester Hills and moved their jobs to South Korea. FTE Automotive laid off 166 people in Auburn Hills, place I know well. Their jobs went to Mexico. Chrysler laid off 5,300 workers. Those jobs went to Mexico, China and India, and numerous other countries. Ford laid off 2,155 workers. Their small car division is out, they're gone; they moved to Mexico. Now Ford is moving a lot of different -- a lot of different production facilities to a lot of different areas. But when you look at what's going on in our country, we want them here.
<AUDIENCE: Yeah!>
<TRUMP:> A Trump administration will stop the flight of American jobs. If Ford or another company announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or to another country, then I will pick up the phone and if I have to, I'll do it personally even though some people would say it's not presidential. Do I care? <LAUGHTER> It's not presidential, sir. But I have some of the greatest business leaders -- Carl Icahn. We have some of the greatest business people in the world endorsing me. They will do it unbelievably well, believe me. But we will have -- and we will use our great business people. We'll use our great -- we have the greatest negotiators in the world. We don't use them. We use political hacks to make trade deals. Our trade deal with Mexico, NAFTA, is a defective deal. It was defective almost from the beginning because we have different tax systems. They're on a VAT system. We're on our system. Well, there's a 17 -- almost a 17 percent difference. So every deal that we make, we are behind 17 percent before we even start. People have known that for years and years and years and it's a defective agreement. Nobody's ever changed it. Believe me, it's going to get changed very quickly, OK? <APPLAUSE> I will call the executives and I will tell them that if they want to do that, where they're taking their factories and they're taking their everything and they're moving it and they think they're gonna sell their cars or their air conditioning units back into the country. We will charge them a 35 percent tax when they try to ship their products back across what will end up being an extremely strong border. <APPLAUSE> And you know what? Just the fact that we're going to do that or we would do that, they'll never move. They're gonna stay in Michigan. Nobody ever told them that. If somebody went to them said, ""Look, please stay, please stay."" You know, we'll go this, that. Then they say, ""No, we're leaving. We're going to Mexico."" Then you say, ""All right, there's the story. No more Mr. Nice Guy."" You make your cars, you make your air -- you know Carrier Air Conditioning. Indianapolis. Great place. Fourteen-hundred people laid off, violently. I mean, <inaudible> people worked there 30 years, they laid them off. So, all I say is this. You want to build your plant in Mexico, have a great time, but if you think you're gonna ship your product across the border -- which will be a very strong border, by the way. <APPLAUSE> You think you're gonna ship your stuff across the border for no tax, no nothing so we end up with unemployment and end up -- we end up with empty plants and factories and you end up with the money, the jobs and the plants, you can forget it. And you know what would happen? If you said that right up front, nobody's leaving, folks. You stop it right away. The politicians don't want to say that because most of them are too stupid to even understand it. <LAUGHTER> But the ones that aren't are taken care of by the special interests and their donors because they want those companies to move because it's to their benefit. It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now the cars are made in the Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint. Not good. <APPLAUSE> But we're gonna turn it all around and we're going to rebuild Flint. I was to Flint recently, and I'll tell you what, it's gone down a long way. And we're going to help you rebuild Detroit. <APPLAUSE> And Mr. Gilbert <ph> has done a great job, by the way. Friend of mine. Done a great job. And we're going to rebuild Michigan and we're going to keep your jobs and lots of other things. So I'd like to share a special message with the African-American community of Michigan, which has been so terribly harmed by the policies of the Clintons and a lot of the Democratic politicians. Look at the city of Detroit. Take a look. It used to be the manufacturing hub of the world. Now, nearly half of Detroit residents don't work, it has the second-highest violent crime rate in the United States and the children are trapped in failing, horrible government schools. Yet as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees pouring into our country. <BOOING> I've outlined a plan for urban renewal, which I believe so strongly in. It's called a new deal for black America. <APPLAUSE> That deal includes a plan to use the money we will save by securing our border and curbing refugee admissions, to invest in communities like Flint and Detroit. We're gonna bring in big numbers of jobs. Tremendous incentives. <APPLAUSE> It includes a pledge of school choice for African-American children. <APPLAUSE> My plan also includes a promise to cancel billions and billions of dollars in climate change spending for the United Nations. <APPLAUSE> It's insane. A number that Hillary wants to actually increase. And instead, use that money to provide for American infrastructure, including clean air and clean water. <APPLAUSE> You saw this recently. We're gonna to spend billions and billions and billions of dollars for a plan that we don't even know where the money's going. And in the meantime, our companies won't be able to compete because they're being regulated and restricted. They're not gonna be able to compete. And I'm an environmentalist. I will tell you, I've received many environmental awards. But I want clean air, I want crystal clean water and I want safety. And we don't have to give hundreds of billions of dollars away to people that are probably laughing at us and not going to do -- you know where the money's going. Not gonna happen. My plan also includes a pledge to reduce violent crime. Every child in this nation has a right to grow up in safety and in peace. <APPLAUSE> And my plan includes a pledge to restore manufacturing in the United States. We're going to start making things again. Hillary and the Democratic Party have run the inner cities for years and only produced more poverty, more crime, worse education. The time has come for real change. I am asking you for the honor of your vote so together, we can turn decades of political failure into generations of lasting access for your children and your grandchildren. <APPLAUSE> Hillary, on the other hand, wants to destroy what's left of manufacturing in Michigan with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. By the way, a disaster. It's a disaster. <BOOING> A Trump administration will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And by the way, we're going to have tremendous trade deals, but we're not gonna have a deal that's 6,000 pages long, that ties in all of these countries together. You have to see a bar chart, lines all over the place. If somebody does something wrong you can't do, we're gonna have single lines going to single -- single different countries. And if they don't do good by us, we send them what's called a letter of termination, 30 days. And during that 30 days, they'll call and we'll probably make a new deal and it'll be even better. Simple deals, folks. You have to see this crazy Trans-Pacific Partnership. And they don't take care of monetary manipulation, which is the single biggest weapon that foreign countries use to kill us, especially China. They're grand masters. We will renegotiate NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal. We'll make a much better deal. <APPLAUSE> We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> We are going to massively cut taxes for the middle class. <APPLAUSE> We will unleash American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. We're going to put our miners back to work. <APPLAUSE> The Obama-Clinton war on coal is going to cost this state 50,000 jobs at least, and you have a war on your steelworkers too, folks. Your steelworkers are suffering. We will also work to restore and protect the Great Lakes. We are going to become... <APPLAUSE> We are going to become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into this country. <BOOING> Hillary's immigration plans mean generation of terrorism, extremism and radicalism spreading into our schools, our communities and every other place right here in Michigan and all throughout the United States. When we win, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. <APPLAUSE> And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. We have no choice. <APPLAUSE> And we'll build safe havens for them in Syria. We're going to get the money from the Gulf states. They have plenty of money. They don't do their share. We'll get the money from the Gulf states. We'll lead the effort because we all have heart. We see what's happening. But we can't do this. We don't want to be the great Trojan horse of the future. It's not gonna happen to us, folks. You see what's happening in Germany. You see what's happening in Paris. People don't even go to Paris anymore. My friend used to go to Paris. ""Oh, Donald, I love Paris. It's just so beautiful."" For years -- I said to him the other day, ""How's Paris?"" He said, ""We don't go there. Are you crazy?"" No, we're not going to be the stupid people anymore, folks. We're gonna be the smart people. <APPLAUSE> A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall and you know that. We received -- so important. You have to have it. I don't know if you know, Hillary wanted a wall. Did you know that? And you know why they didn't it, a big fence, wall? You know why they didn't build it? They couldn't get their environmental impact statements. Can you believe it? The United States of America wants to put up a wall in '06, 2016. Hillary was in favor of it. They couldn't get the approval to build the wall. Can you believe this? And then you see China in the middle of the South China Sea building a massive fortress. And you know what happened? They said Sunday evening, let's do it. You know when work started? Monday morning. I jokingly said to a friend of mine in China, how long did it take you to get the environmental impact statement approved? He looked at me and said, you're kidding, aren't you? I said, yes, I'm kidding. So they're building, they're ripping it up with the biggest excavators you've ever seen and they're ripping it up and they're building -- they're not supposed to be doing it, by the way. The only reason they're doing it is because they have no respect for our president who's out campaigning all the time. This guy ought to spend more time in bringing jobs back to Michigan and less time -- and less time fighting for somebody who's under criminal investigation which he shouldn't be doing. <APPLAUSE> We've received the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers; 16,500 border patrol officers. The first time they've ever done it because they know we know what we're doing. They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been. It's a national emergency. They also warn that America's plan under Hillary Clinton is the most radical proposal -- quote, ""radical proposal in U.S. history."" When I become president, we will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens. We have people in this country that are serious, serious criminals. And we will put America first. You know, we have some very, very rough people, and we want to deport the people while she was secretary of state and they bring these people back to their countries, and the countries very intelligently, they said, no, we don't want a murder; no, we don't want a drug dealer; we don't want the head of a gang in Los Angeles; they call up the secretary of state's office. They said, oh, that's OK. Bring them back. So we release them right into our country. How stupid are we? And I promise you -- it's well-known -- I promise you, whether it's four years or eight years, we'll figure that out. There won't be one time -- there won't be one time when any of these thugs come back into our country. Not one time. <APPLAUSE> We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We need a new foreign policy that puts America first and we're going to have it very, very quickly. Hillary led us to disaster in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya. Then after Benghazi, she looked the families of the fallen in the eye and lied. She blamed their deaths on a video, which was a lie. <BOOING> Remember when she back to Bosnia? Under fire, remember? Oh, it was under fire, it was so dangerous. Seriously. Under fire. Remember? But they had a video clip she landed and these beautiful little girls were handing flowers and they -- she came under fire. It turned out not to be true. She apologized. She apologized. But you have to ask her, the media -- the most dishonest people, they have to ask her -- they have to ask her -- <BOOING> They have to ask her. They have to ask her, when Donna Brazile, who I told you just got fired, when Donna Brazile gave her the questions to the debate -- asked this question to her, why didn't she report it? She accepted those questions. She accepted those questions to the debate. She had the questions to the debate. Forget about Donna -- I don't care about Donna Brazile. Why didn't Hillary Clinton report that she was given essentially unethically, probably illegally, why didn't she report that she had the questions? Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East and now it's worse than it's ever been before. Had Obama and others gone to the beach, Obama could have gone to the golf course. We would have been in much better shape. We shouldn't have gone into the war, and she thinks I'm a hawk. Oh, Donald Trump. We shouldn't have gone in. And we certainly shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out, because she created a vacuum ISIS formed. Now she's I'm going to get rid of -- she's going to rid of ISIS. She has zero chance. She is dreaming. ISIS is dreaming about her becoming president. And she also -- you know, she's going to fix it. There was no ISIS when she was secretary of state. She and Obama created it through the vacuum that they created by stupidly the way they got out. Even Mosul -- we're trying to retake Mosul for a second time, because we essentially gave it up, so now we're going in. And we gave them -- did we give them enough advanced notice? Four months is enough time, right? General, did we give Mosul enough advanced notice? I think so. Four months. And I keep saying, whatever happened to the element of surprise, the element of surprise. and we're trying to retake Mosul a second time. We essentially gave it up. Did we give them enough advanced notice? four months is enough time. General, did we give Mosul enough advanced notice? I think so. Four months. And I keep saying, whatever happened to the element of surprise? The element of surprise. Imagine if some of the money had been spent, $6 trillion in the Middle East, on building new schools and roads and bridges right here in Michigan. Now Hillary, trapped in her Washington bubble, that's blind to the lessons, wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could drag us into a World War III. OK, folks. She -- I will tell you what. She will get us into World War III. She will get us into World War III. I will tell you that. She's incompetent. She will get us into World War III. The arrogant political class never learns. They keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. They keep telling the same lies. They keep producing the same failed results. How can Hillary manage this country when she can't even manage her e-mails? <APPLAUSE> It's just one disaster after another, one scandal after another, one betrayal after another. To all Americans I say it is now time for new leadership. All of them. <APPLAUSE> And just in finishing up, in finishing up, just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. Hillary is increasing your taxes. We will eliminate every unnecessary job- killing regulation. We're going to cancel every illegal Obama executive order. <APPLAUSE> We will rebuild our military, and we are going to take great care of our fantastic veterans. It's about time. <APPLAUSE> Twenty-two veterans a day commits suicide. Can you believe that number? Twenty-two veterans a day are committing suicide. They wait on line for seven, eight, nine days when a simple prescription or a simple procedure could solve their problem -- 22 veterans, these are our greatest people, committing suicide a day. It's not going to be that way anymore, folks. We're going to take care of our veterans, and I have tremendous veteran support. We are going to totally support the men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We will save the second amendment which is under total siege. <APPLAUSE> And we will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> Hillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change and wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I am asking you to dream big, dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love of our country. <APPLAUSE> I'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade, or many decades away. America is tired of incompetence. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians, and start believing in each other. We have to. Start believing in each other and start believing in the greatness of our country. <APPLAUSE> There is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics. Hillary has been there for 30 years, and she's accomplished nothing. She's just made things worse. She is a candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We're the movement of the future. <APPLAUSE> Some of the greatest political pundits today, Bill O'Reilly, many others, said this is the single greatest political phenomena of their lifetime. It is. And folks, we don't want to throw it away. That's why we have to get out and vote November 8th. Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, independents and first-time voters, of which there are so many. We are asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day. We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors, not the special interests. <APPLAUSE> We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better day and a better future. With your vote, we are just eight days away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life. <APPLAUSE> Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. God bless you. Get out and vote, Michigan. Get out and vote November 8th. Thank you, everybody. God bless you. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-01"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. Great people, great state. Thank you everybody. So we have thousands of people outside, but rather than wait, let's get started, right? <APPLAUSE> We have almost 4,000 people. They're going to be coming in as we speak, but I think we get going right now. Is that correct? They are being checked out. I want to begin by thanking the great Wisconsin leaders who are here with us today. Chairman Reince Priebus who gave a very inspirational speech. Senator Ron Johnson, I hope you all going to get out and vote for Ron. We're going to... <APPLAUSE> We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> A great athlete, people don't know that, great athlete and a wonderful guy. He's been with me right from the beginning, Congressman Sean Duffy... <APPLAUSE> ... and your party chairman who's done an incredible job, we all know Brad Courtney. Thank you, Brad. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody. A special thank you to Governor Scott Walker... <APPLAUSE> ... who has done a fantastic job in Wisconsin. I want to tell you I ran against him. He is tough, he is brutal. I want to be very respectful, he is one tough cookie. So, to Governor Walker, I want to thank you. Tremendous, tremendous competitor... <APPLAUSE> ... and we're with him forever. Thank you, Scott. Thank you. Most importantly, I want to thank all of you here in attendance today and everyone who is part of this magnificent movement to make America great again. That is what we're going to do. <APPLAUSE> In just one week, we are going to win the great state of Wisconsin. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to win back the White House. It's going to happen folks. A lot of good polls out there today. We just got one; we're seven up in North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> Seven up, North Carolina. We're way ahead in Florida, way ahead in Ohio, wow. We're doing great, Ohio and Florida, we're doing great. Iowa, way up in Iowa. We're getting tremendous help from Governor Branstad. We're sort of way up everywhere. You know, they were saying Texas is going to be close. It looks like Texas is in play. Guess what? Total blowout. We love Texas. <APPLAUSE> We love Texas. We're way up in Georgia, that was another one that said it looks like Georgia might be in play. Guess what? We're way up. So, that's the way it is. <APPLAUSE> I also want to thank some of our great people that were here tonight, Mayor Giuliani who is incredible and he's been so loyal. <APPLAUSE> And how about Coach Bobby Knight? He did pretty well against you, folks, but we still respect. We want winners, right? We're on the cusp of something incredible -- historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families, communities, and citizens. It's going to happen. Real change that begins with immediately, repealing and replacing Obamacare, a total disaster, total disaster. <APPLAUSE> It's just been announced that the residents of Wisconsin -- congratulations -- are going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike. You know that, right? <BOOING> I'm not going to tell you what it is because I want you to leave here happy. I don't want you to be depressed, but don't worry about it. We're going to get rid of it so you're not going to have to worry about it. <APPLAUSE> In the great state of Arizona, premiums are going up more than 116 percent. They're not too happy. <BOOING> More than three-quarters of the counties in Wisconsin are losing Obamacare insurers next year, lots of luck in your negotiation with whoever is left. In Minnesota where premiums are going to be increased -- who's from Minnesota? <APPLAUSE> Wow. Wow. <APPLAUSE> Great, great. That's so nice. Look at that man, and you look fantastic. He says, ""Minnesota Cancer Patient for Trump."" You're going to get better, OK? You're going to get better. You're going to get better fast. You look beautiful. That's cool. And you know, we just had news that in Minnesota we are doing fantastically well. I didn't know we'll have so many people. <APPLAUSE> That's great. We're going to do our job for it. The premium increase will be close to 60 percent -- you know that -- 60 percent in Minnesota and a lot higher following, so that's pretty bad. The Democratic governor has just said the Affordable Care Act in Minnesota is no longer affordable. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are leaving, and deductibles are through the roof. Other than that it's a wonderful thing. Many Americans are now paying more for health care than for their mortgages or their rent -- a first in the history of America, first time that's ever happened. Obamacare is a disaster. It's a -- it's a total catastrophe, yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive and it's still won't work. <BOOING> I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Wisconsin and for every family in our country. <APPLAUSE> Real change...
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody. That's so nice. You know, this is a movement like has never been seen in this country before. <APPLAUSE> And if I said that and if it weren't so, those extremely dishonest people, the media, the world's most... <BOOING> ... dishonest people, horrible people, untruthful people. They would be saying, he said this, he said that, he said this. Let me tell you they are extremely dishonest, and yet we are leading with all of the dishonesty. We're leading and I think we're leading big. And I think on November 8th it will even be bigger. <APPLAUSE> Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. And now it's been reported that there are FBI inquiries probing virtually all of Hillary Clinton's inner circle. <APPLAUSE> She wants to blame everyone else...
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> You know, somehow I think that Obamacare is not going to be her biggest problem. Does that make sense? <APPLAUSE> She wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she has really no one else to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set-up an illegal, private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. You know that, she knows it. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay-to-play scheme at the State Department. Hillary is the one endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server. <BOOING> Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI -- 39 times to the FBI, and each lie -- I mean, each time she said -- remember she does -- right, she said, sorry, I don't recall. I don't recall, 39 times. Well, each time she said that, that was also a lie, and I'm not even including that. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. It was Hillary who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress... <BOOING> ... after. And she is also the one -- this just came up recently. By the way, if that were Reince or me or somebody, it would have been the biggest story in the world. She also accepted debate questions given to her in advance and then used them to cheat against Bernie Sanders... <BOOING> ... instead of reporting this terrible -- say terrible breach, right? Instead of reporting this terrible breach of ethics to the public or to somebody. She used it. You notice they keep talking about Donna Brazile, Donna Brazile. Well, Donna Brazile cheated. And frankly, she should resign from the DNC. <APPLAUSE> She was just fired from the networks. She should now resign from DNC. Think of that. Can you imagine if Reince got the questions for a debate, gave them to me and they found out, you know what it would be, a double electric chair, right? It would be on the front page in the ""New York Times,"" the ""Washington Post."" It's hardly covered, can you believe it? She got -- I mean, to me, it's such a breach, you know, being a student, being a believer in so many different things -- to me, it's such a breach. She got the questions and didn't report. Nobody even talks about that. They talk about Donna Brazile, but they don't talk about Hillary. Hillary got the questions in a debate against Bernie Sanders and she didn't report it. <BOOING> Surreal cheating, and it was hardly covered. But we know the answer, so get out and vote on November 8th. Remember? <APPLAUSE> Hillary is not the victim. The American people are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way. And this is your one chance to change it -- it's your one chance. I don't think you're going to have another chance, folks. We have an election coming up. You're not going to have another chance. In four years, you can forget it. If she were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis, and the work of government would grind to an unbelievably unglorious halt. She is likely to be under investigation for many years, probably concluding in a very large-scale criminal trial. <BOOING> In a newly released e-mail, John Podesta has been caught saying, ""We have to dump all of those e-mails."" Can you believe this? That's WikiLeaks. <BOOING> And he also said, to me it has made a big -- a big statement, John Podesta -- I'll tell you what, if he worked for me, I would fire him so fast. He is such a nasty guy. <APPLAUSE> He would -- I would fire him like the Apprentice, ""John, you're fired."" <APPLAUSE> Amazing. Nasty guy, he's a nasty guy.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> He's a nasty guy. But he said, you know, you don't like to say bad things, you work for people. He said, Hillary has bad instincts. Bernie Sanders said, She has bad judgment. She's got both. They're pretty similar when you think about it. As it also turns out, one of the top Department of Justice officials, the Assistant Attorney General is a close associate of Podesta. The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi, and Podesta described him as the man who kept him out of jail, works for the Justice Department. Has our country ever had a situation like it is going on right now? Have we ever had anything like it? <BOOING> This is a good time to make an important public service announcement because a lot of things have happened over the last few days. This is a message for any Democratic voter who have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton and who are having a bad case of buyers' remorse? <LAUGHTER> In other words, you want to change your vote. Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake. A lot of stuff has come out since you voted. So if you live here or in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Minnesota, those four places... <APPLAUSE> ... you can change your vote to Donald Trump. We'll make America great again. OK? <APPLAUSE> She is not going to make America great. She will never make America great. The Clintons are the sordid past. We are the bright future. I say we -- we, it's we. I am a messenger -- I am only a messenger, remember, I'm only a messenger, but you have to say I'm doing a pretty good job as a messenger. <APPLAUSE> But I'm the messenger. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to our government finally. <APPLAUSE> I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words we are all here to say when we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C., and we are going to drain the swamp. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!>
<TRUMP:> You're not told -- I've said this before, but it was very interesting because when I first heard the statement, I said, give me a break. I hate it. <LAUGHTER> I said <inaudible>. I said it, the people went crazy. Then I went to a rally with 18,000 people, I said it, they went totally crazy. And then I said it again and again, this has only been going on for about a week and a half. And now I love it, I love the statement and it is very active. It is very active. <APPLAUSE> At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. <APPLAUSE> Right now 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty. Forty -- that's so true. Can you believe in this country? Forty-three percent of African-American school-aged children live in poverty. Thirty-two percent of Hispanic school-aged children live in poverty. This is our country. This is unacceptable in America. I will fix it -- I will fix it -- I will fix it. <APPLAUSE> I've been saying a lot and I've been saying and speaking very openly about the inner cities and saying to the African-American community, the Hispanic community, I've been saying, what do you have to lose? It's such a disaster. What do you have to lose -- thank you. We're going to fix it. We're going to bring back great schools. We're going to stop the crime. The crime is unbelievable. We are going to bring back your jobs. What do you have to lose? We are going to fix it. As your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization. <APPLAUSE> We will replace decades of failure with generations of success. We're going to have generations of success. America has lost one- third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA. You know about that. <BOOING> One-third of your jobs -- you know, we have a highway, one-way highway right into Mexico in these other countries. They get the jobs, they get the plants, they get the money, we get the unemployment and the drugs, not a good deal. That's going to be changed around, folks. It's going to be changed here. <APPLAUSE> I mean, you listen to this where America has lost -- we're going to build a wall, don't worry about it. We're going to build a wall. <APPLAUSE> That's not even close. And Mexico is going to pay for the wall, and they understand that. They understand that. <APPLAUSE> America has lost -- listen to this because it's impossible. I have been saying for two weeks -- I just got this stat -- for two weeks I've been saying, that's a typo. That's some kind of an error. It can't be possible. America has lost 70,000 factories -- 70,000. I thought they meant 700, I said, you have a mistake here, maybe 7,000. America has lost 70,000 factories because of politicians that don't know what they are doing or they are controlled by their special interests. Since China entered the World Trade Organization -- another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster -- we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. That's what's happening to our country. We're being treated like we're stupid people. We have leaders who do not know what they are doing. We have leaders that don't have a clue. It's the single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. That's what's happened to us. Hutchison Technology laid off 400 workers right here and moved their jobs to Thailand. Honeywell laid off 974 workers making printed circuit boards in Chippewa Falls. Their jobs... <APPLAUSE> You won't be clapping for this -- their jobs went to China. This is a federal problem because Scott and these people have kept so many places, but they're -- it's very hard. It's very hard because we don't fight with real tools, meaning you make your product, you want to come back, not going to be so easy, you're going to pay a nice big fat tax on that product coming in. <APPLAUSE> TTM Technology laid off 166 workers, and most of them went into Mexico and other places. Lots of jobs going to China, lots of jobs going to Japan, lots of jobs going to South Korea, and unbelievable numbers of jobs, and plants, and factories and everything else going into Mexico. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Wisconsin. We'll work with your governor who is a great, great governor and we're going to stop it. <APPLAUSE> We are going to stop it. The theft -- and that's what it is -- of American prosperity will come to a very rapid end. From now on it's going to be America first. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> A Donald Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, and we will stand up to foreign product dumping all over, currency manipulation, and all of the unfair subsidy behavior that's going all over our country, makes it impossible -- impossible for our businesses to compete. They'll be competing very soon. <APPLAUSE> We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. That will be a disaster. <APPLAUSE> As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on American businesses from 35 percent down to 15 percent. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. <APPLAUSE> We will become a rich nation again, but to be a reach nation, we must also be a safe nation. In Chicago, 3,664 people have been shot since January 1st of this year. Can you believe that? That's worse than the places you read about and see in the Middle East, these are war zones. We have places that are more dangerous. In Milwaukee, homicides have risen to the highest level in more than 20 years. Nationwide, murders have experienced their largest single year increase in 45 years. You don't hear that from the dishonest media. they don't tell you that -- they don't tell you that. <BOOING> They don't tell you that. They're there for one reason. They want to protect certain people like Hillary. It's getting hard to protect her, fellows. It's getting very -- getting very, very hard to protect her -- getting very hard to protect her. She's out of control. A Trump administration will work with local and federal law enforcements to end this growing crime wave, we have a crime wave. Every child in America has the right to grow up in safety and in peace. <APPLAUSE> And we will also keep you safe from terrorism. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. <BOOING> Who can't even believe it? Her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading into your schools and throughout your communities. When I am elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. We have no choice. <APPLAUSE> And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And as I said, and as you know, we're not playing games, yes, we will build the wall. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!>
<TRUMP:> And the fact that it's 110 degrees in this room, I don't care. <LAUGHTER> Think of it as a sauna. This room was not designed for this many people. Think of it as a sauna and to use a sauna, you have to pay money. We get this for nothing. We have received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. First time they have ever done it. 16,500 great, amazing people. They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been. It's a national emergency. It's the worst it's ever been right now. You know, you try and get some stats. They don't want to give you the stats -- the worst it's ever been right now just about as bad as it gets. Hillary has pledged totally open borders. There goes your country... <BOOING> ... which truly would mean the destruction of the United States in a true sense. The immigrant officers warned in a letter when they endorsed me that Hillary's plan is, quote, ""The most radical immigration proposal in United States history,"" and that it would, quote, ""Lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives."" As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries very intelligently would not take them back. They don't want to take back murderers, drug lords, gang members, they say no. And let me just tell you something, they would bring them to their country, their country would say no. Get them out, bring them back to the United States where your leaders are stupid people. Bring them back to the United States. Let me tell you, that won't happen whether it's four years or eight years, that won't happen once if I am president, not once. <APPLAUSE> One such criminal was set free on Hillary's watch, went on to kill a young American girl, a fantastic young woman named Casey Chadwick. You probably read about her. The killer who had already been convicted for shooting a girl in the head previously, and who people were begging to incarcerate or send out of our country should have been sent home, instead he was set free and stabbed Casey in the face and neck 15 different times and stuffed her body in a closet. People were begging that he be sent out -- we're going to make America safe again, believe me. <APPLAUSE> That's one of many. That's one of many, so many different stories. Hillary also strongly supports sanctuary cities... <BOOING> ... like in San Francisco where the incredible Kate Steinle, incredible young woman was killed in her father's arms by a five-time deported illegal immigrant. A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. <APPLAUSE> We will deport all criminal aliens, stop the drugs from pouring into our communities and we will end this long nightmare of violence like we've never seen before. <APPLAUSE> We will also appeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and re- build our badly depleted military, we have no choice -- we have no choice. That includes great support for nearby Fort McCoy. <APPLAUSE> I am honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients -- it's a great group. Nobody has like we have whether it's law enforcement, the military, the veterans, and we are going to take care of our veterans, folks. <APPLAUSE> Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought disaster to Iraq -- just total disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya. She empowered Iran, and she unleashed ISIS with the great void that was created, by the way, her and president Obama -- the campaigner -- I call him the ""campaigning"" -- he ought to focus -- instead on campaigning for Hillary Clinton, where he's probably now got a conflict in campaigning for her -- he ought to focus on bringing jobs back to our country, focus on getting rid of ISIS, focus on lots of other things. <APPLAUSE> Now, Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria, a conflict with a nuclear armed Russia that could, frankly, for all we know to trigger World War III. For what? Hillary and her failed Washington establishment have spent six trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East that never end and that we never win. Remember that, they never end and we never win. And now, the Middle East is in worse shape than ever before. We could have built our country twice. We could have rebuilt the United States with six trillion dollars, we could have rebuilt it twice. They dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They have left our borders wide open at home and they have shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. <BOOING> To all Americans I say, it is now time finally for new leadership for change. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. In closing, just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days. We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. <APPLAUSE> And she is going to raise your taxes substantially, remember. We are going to eliminate every unnecessary job killing regulation. <APPLAUSE> We will cancel every illegal Obama executive order. There are plenty of them -- there are plenty of them. <APPLAUSE> There are plenty of them. We will rebuild our military and we will take care of our great, great veterans. We're going to take care of them. They have been treated terribly -- terribly. Our veterans have been treated terribly.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. We are going to provide school choice and put an end to common core. We're bringing our education local. <APPLAUSE> We will support the great men and women of law enforcement. That will take place quickly. <APPLAUSE> The National Rifle -- you know this, right? The National Rifle Association, NRA, endorsed me -- the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody running for president. <APPLAUSE> We are going to save our Second Amendment, which is totally under siege. We're going to save our Second Amendment. <APPLAUSE> And appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> Hillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change, and wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. <BOOING> I am asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love of this great country. <APPLAUSE> I am tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day, when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. <APPLAUSE> There has never been a movement like this in our country's history. There never will be again perhaps, but we have to take advantage of it on November 8th. We're going to turn things around and rapidly and rapidly. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. <APPLAUSE> There is no challenge too great and no dream outside of our reach, there is not. There is no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and not the critics. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and she has accomplished nothing. She's just made things worse. <BOOING> She is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are, we are. <APPLAUSE> Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents and first-time voters of which there are many, there are many. <APPLAUSE> We are asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power should rule the day for our country. <APPLAUSE> And I have been on the other side and I understand the other side, perhaps I understand it better than anybody else, but I love our country and I saw what was happening to our country, and I made the right decision because, boy, did I become an outsider quickly. That I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interest. <APPLAUSE> We are fighting to unlock the tremendous potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future, and it will happen. With your vote, we are just -- listen to this, after all of this time, one week -- one week, do you believe it? <APPLAUSE> This started on June 16th...
<AUDIENCE: (OFF-MIKE)>
<TRUMP:> June 16th. Thank you.
<AUDIENCE: (OFF-MIKE)>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I will not disappoint you, that I promise, that I promise. You won't be disappointed. <APPLAUSE> This great movement started on June 16th of last year, and now we're one week away -- think of it, one week, from the change you've been waiting your entire life, one week away. So on November 8th, go out. Don't disappoint yourselves, your families. Don't worry about me. We have to do it. We really have to do it because together we will make America wealthy again. <APPLAUSE> We will make America strong again. <APPLAUSE> We will make America safe again. <APPLAUSE> And we will make America great again. God bless you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-01"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> I would like to thank my incredible running mate, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> And I love you, too. <APPLAUSE> We have a lot of very enthused and excited people in this campaign. So I really do thank all of you. <APPLAUSE> I would like to thank my incredible running mate, Mike Pence, on the tremendous job he's done. And he's a fantastic leader and a leader on health care issues, and to have him involved is just my very great honor, believe me. <APPLAUSE> I'd also like to thank Dr. Ben Carson. <APPLAUSE> Not only a great man, and I don't say that about a lot of people, but one of the toughest competitors I've ever faced. People don't know how well he did during those primaries. And I just kept looking back. And I just kept seeing him. And boy, I'll tell you. But even more importantly, he's a brilliant physician and I hope he will be very much involved with my administration in the coming years. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. I'd also like to recognize the distinguished members of Congress in attendance who have all been at the forefront of health care, and have been so helpful to me: Congresswoman Ellmers, Lummis; Congressmen Price, Harris, Burgess and DesJarlais. <APPLAUSE> And let me give a special thanks to Senator Barrasso, a terrific doctor, a Senate leader, who did incredible work chairing our platform committee, just unbelievable work. So I want to thank you very much, Senator. Fantastic job. <APPLAUSE> And been very, very loyal to what we're doing and what we represent. So thank you, Senator.
<TRUMP:> When we win on November 8th... <APPLAUSE> ... and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. <APPLAUSE> I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace and it will be such an honor for me, for you and for everybody in this country because Obamacare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe. The president said if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
<AUDIENCE: Lie!>
<TRUMP:> Which may go down as one of the great political lies of the century. Even the skeptical Democrats believed him and approved the legislation. There were Democrats that were very much against it, but they believed him and they approved it. No one ever read, or certainly very few people, the 2,700 page bill. To this day, nobody understands it. The Obama administration has just announced massive double digit and triple digit Obamacare premium hikes everywhere, all throughout the country. Here in Pennsylvania, premiums are going to increase more than 60 percent and that's nothing compared to what will happen in the future. Of course, in the future, I'm president, there won't be Obamacare, so you won't have to worry about it. <APPLAUSE> That means parents won't have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids. In the great state of Arizona, a wonderful place I just left, premiums will go up even higher than 116 percent. Other states are going up more than 60, 70, 80, 90 percent. Deductibles can go to $12,000, $13,000, $14,000, even $15,000. In other words, your health care won't even be usable. You're paying all this money, you won't even get to use it. People all across the country are devastated. In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which, by the way, is a first in American history. This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life. One-third of the counties -- think of this, one-third of the counties in Pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left if you have that. That includes Philadelphia, where I went to school. The Associated Press found that some of the 440,000 Pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcare.gov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation. The people of Philadelphia.
<TRUMP:> Insurers are leaving, premiums are soaring, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof. Workers' hours are being cut, hiring is frozen -- totally frozen -- and wages are being slashed. Obamacare means higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. She wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in America. If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever. It's one of the single most important reasons why we must win on November 8th, we must win. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Our replacement plan includes health savings accounts, a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines and letting states manage Medicaid dollars so much better. We will create quality, reliable, affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really wanna make for their families. It will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost. We've also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every American family. And while this is really -- thank you. <APPLAUSE> While this is really a meeting and that's what it is, it's a meeting of very, very special people and I appreciate you all being here. But it's a meeting talking about health care and Obamacare. Our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs. We have to do it. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna bring back your manufacturing, we're gonna bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the American middle class and our country as a whole. Our jobs are being stolen. Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. The city of Philadelphia has lost more than one-third of its manufacturing jobs since China joined the Word Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, believe me. And we have the greatest negotiators in the world. We will use our great negotiators. <APPLAUSE> We'll <ph> have a fair deal, but we'll have a deal that goes in two directions, not one direction, right into Mexico and these other places. <APPLAUSE> And stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation and unfair subsidy behavior. <APPLAUSE> We are going to bring manufacturing jobs, lots of jobs, back to Pennsylvania. We're gonna do it. And it won't even be difficult. <APPLAUSE> We're going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners. Our miners have been mistreated horribly. <APPLAUSE> We will be producing clean coal, oil, natural gas and shale energy. <APPLAUSE> We're also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt, so badly hurt.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Whose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over the state, and frankly, all over this country, by China and other countries. Nobody has been treated worse than these workers, but that will change on January 20th of next year, believe me. It will change. <APPLAUSE> We're also going to provide the children of the state with school choice. So important. <APPLAUSE> That means parents can spend and take care of their children, but they can send their kids to public school, to private, to chartered, to magnet, to religious or to home school. It's going to be their right and it's going to be something that's so, so good for your children and for the education of your children. <APPLAUSE> We will also totally eliminate Common Core and bring education local. We're gonna bring it local. <APPLAUSE> People do not like Common Core in this country, that I can tell you <ph>. <LAUGHTER> And our system is failing, so it's obviously not working. We're gonna eliminate Common Core, we're gonna bring it local. Our tax plan will provide a 35 percent tax cut to middle class families with two kids. As an example, you have two kids, a 35 percent cut so desperately needed. Our middle class has not been properly respected, that I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> We will let parents deduct childcare expenses from their taxes and create tax-free childcare and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low income families. <APPLAUSE> We will eliminate the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. When did we ever need it more? Greatest people on Earth in our military, but it's badly depleted. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. People love this country, don't they? Isn't it beautiful, right? Beautiful. <APPLAUSE> It's a beautiful thing to watch and see. And I see it all over the country, no matter where we go. And every time I say we are going to rebuild our depleted military, it's always the same response. It's an incredible response. <APPLAUSE> Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I, think of that. Smallest since World War I. And rebuilding it will require a national effort. That's why I will ask my Secretary of the Navy to review facilities like the Philadelphia Navy Yard, I know it well. <APPLAUSE> With a long history of service to our Navy, proximity to vibrant private industry and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again. <APPLAUSE> To recruit master craftsman <ph> this buildup requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Vocational training is a great thing. We don't do it anymore. We don't do it anymore. <APPLAUSE> And I must tell you, so often in going to college right down the road and going to college, we have people that were brilliant and we had other people that weren't as brilliant in that way but were brilliant, incredible when it came to fixing a motor, when it came to fixing something that I had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses had no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded.
<TRUMP:> And we don't do that anymore. Vocational training for our country is so, so, so important. <APPLAUSE> And just in closing -- and they loved it. They loved it. They didn't want to be doing what I was doing. They loved it. They were so good at it and they loved it. So vocational training, we're going to start it up big league. <APPLAUSE> We will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country. I'm not a politician. My only special interest is you, the American people. That's why I've done this <ph>. <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> The guiding rule of the political class in Washington, D.C. is that they are looking out only for themselves, only for themselves with the exception of these few people. <LAUGHTER> I feel guilty as I'm looking, they're staring me in the eyes. So I have to say with these exceptions. They will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense. I'm running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the American people to create generations of success. I'm running... <APPLAUSE> I'm running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities. We need safety. And by the way, our law enforcement officials, these are great, great people. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. And we are going to give great prosperity to our economy. I want to go into our poorest communities and work on a national plan of revitalization, the inner cities. <APPLAUSE> And I've been working with so many African-American groups. These are such incredible people. We've been talking about it, working on it. We're going to bring jobs into the inner cities. We're going to bring safety. We're going to bring education, good, good schools into the inner cities. <APPLAUSE> The spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody. And it's gonna work. It's gonna work. You watch. Americans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day. But politicians for the most part really mean another decade, because that's what they're talking about. Enough waiting. Time is now. But to accomplish our goals, we must cut our ties with the small <ph> bitter, petty politics of the past. We must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end, that we never win and that have made us far less safe. Think of it <ph>. <APPLAUSE> Think of all the money that's spent, all the lives that have been lost.
<TRUMP:> And we're far less safe today than we were before we started. They've left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. It's time for new leadership. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> I've led a great life and I truly love our country. So now I want to give back to the country that's been so good to me, that's why I'm doing this. <APPLAUSE> All I see everywhere I travel in this nation, and I've been everywhere, is untapped potential waiting to be realized. The people are amazing, the people are amazing. If we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach. <APPLAUSE> If we stopped believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves, then anything, anything is possible. <APPLAUSE> I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country. <APPLAUSE> That is how we will truly make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much, thank you everybody. God bless you, thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> I love that sign, ""Blacks for Trump."" I love that sign, thank you. <APPLAUSE> There are a lot of those signs. Thank you. ""Women for Trump."" <APPLAUSE> ""Hispanics for Trump."" <APPLAUSE> There's one ""Women and Hispanics for Trump."" <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> We're on the cusp of an incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families, communities and citizens, to you. The system is rigged, remember that. The system is rigged. Right now it's rigged. We're going to change it. There's some breaking news about that subject that we're going to discuss right now. As I mentioned yesterday, on of the -- and you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read it -- one of the top Department of Justice officials involved in the e-mail investigation, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kassig...<BOOING>
<TRUMP:> ... is a close associate of John Podesta. The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi and Podesta, who by the way said Hillary Clinton has terrible instincts on WikiLeaks, described him as the man who kept him, Podesta, out of jail. Kadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Now, today, in a newly released e- mail -- through WikiLeaks again -- we learned that Kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the Clinton campaign and that... <BOOING> ... right? And that Kadzik said quote ""It will be a while before the State Department posts the e-mails."" Remember they were waiting for the e-mails. <BOOING> Podesta forwarded the e-mails to Clinton's top staff and said, additional chances for mischief. These are the people that want to run our country, folks. <BOOING> The spread of political agendas into the Justice Department -- there's never been a thing like this that has happened in our country's history -- is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country. But with your vote you can beat the system, the rigged system, and deliver justice. So, show up early and vote. Show up early. You know, the lines are incredible. The polls are all saying we're going to win Florida. Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Get out there and vote. Pretend we're slightly behind. You got to get -- we don't want to blow this. This is the one chance we have, it'll never happen again. It's not going to happen. In four years, it's not going to happen -- it can't happen again. This is a movement like we have never seen in this country before. These crowds, the enthusiasm, the love. <APPLAUSE> Got to get out and vote. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary is not going to be the answer because she wants to make it more expensive. She's doubling down. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida -- sorry to tell you this, folks -- are going to experience a massive, massive double digit premium hike. <BOOING> Now, I know what that hike is, but I want you to leave here happy, I want you to be happy people. I want you to think about the future after we take back the White House so I'm not going to tell you what your hike is, but let me just say it's going to be very substantial. And Obamacare doesn't work on top of everything else. As an example, in the great state of Arizona -- which I just left -- premiums are going up more than 116 percent. It's out of control. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year. Lots of luck in your negotiation. In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor said, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof. Wasn't supposed to be like this, but I said it was going to be like this before it was passed because I understand how business works.
<TRUMP:> Obamacare never had a chance. It's a catastrophe. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive. It's going to go up a lot. People aren't going to be able to afford it so I'm not sure that it matters, they're just not going to be able to pay. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and the United States. <APPLAUSE> Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI has -- did you hear about this little event? The FBI re-opening the investigation. <APPLAUSE> They're re-opening the investigation into Crooked Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> Crooked Hillary, she's crooked. <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> She is a crooked one, there's no question. Crooked Hillary Clinton, you know that term has really stuck, everyone's calling her -- has anyone seen Crooked Hillary Clinton today? <LAUGHTER> That's going to be a great term for a president, right? Boy, oh boy, what a mess. This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. And now it's been reported that there are FBI inquiries probing virtually all of Hillary Clinton's inner circle and many of the things she's done over the years. It's about time. Remember, it's a rigged system, remember it's about time. She wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she really has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. The woman screaming exactly, exactly, it is exactly. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay-for-play scheme at the State Department and who ripped off the people of Haiti, the people of Haiti were ripped off. <BOOING> And I met with the people of Little Haiti. Anybody here? These are great people, great, thank you. Hillary is the one who endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. <BOOING> And she's the one who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a Congressional subpoena. <BOOING> She also accepted debate questions given to her in advance by Donna Brazile... <BOOING> ... and then used those debate questions to cheat. It's cheating, the worst level. Instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach. So she got the answers, cheating. She got the questions, cheating. And then she -- rather than reporting them, rather than saying this shouldn't be happening -- she used them against Bernie Sanders. Can you imagine -- she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy I don't think it mattered. We won those debates. <APPLAUSE> Did you see her at the end of the debates? Folks, she was exhausted. You know what she did? She immediately went home and went to sleep.<LAUGHTER>
<TRUMP:> Hillary is not the victim, and the American people, frankly, are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way. But this is your chance finally to change it, November 8th. Now in Florida's case, earlier. Now, just so you understand, record turnout, unbelievable numbers, unbelievable. We're doing great with the African-American community. <APPLAUSE> We're doing great with the Hispanic community. <APPLAUSE> And the lines are four, five and six blocks long. They've never seen anything like it. And the polls have just come up. We're way up in Florida. I shouldn't say that, because I want you to go vote. <APPLAUSE> OK, ready? We're going to pretend we're down. We're down. Pretend, right? We'll pretend we're down. No, we got to win. We got to win big. We got to beat her. Got to beat her. We're up in Ohio, we're up in Iowa, we're up in North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> I think we're doing great in Pennsylvania, from what I hear. <APPLAUSE> Folks, you're going to be so proud. You're going to be so proud. We're going to make America great again. You're going to be so happy and you're going to be so proud of your country again. If Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. <BOOING> Haven't we just been through a lot with the Clintons, right? Remember when he was impeached for lying? He can't practice law. He doesn't have the right to practice law. Didn't we just go through this? And the last thing we need is another four years of Obama. That's the last thing. <BOOING> And this will be worse. That means ISIS, that means high taxes, that means bad health care, that means no border. Without a border, we don't have a country. The work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected. She'll be in court for her entire tenure and she'll be convicted. Because look, the first time -- I mean, frankly, forget about this time. The first time she gets a subpoena from the United States Congress and she deletes everything? There shouldn't have been a second time. But I have respect that the FBI has given it a second chance. And this time, I have no doubt that in that 650,000 e-mails -- did you see where they said, oh, we're not worried. They're duplicates. How can there be duplicates if there are hundreds of thousands more than you started off with?
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> So today, I guess WikiLeaks, it sounds like, is going to be dropping some more, and if we met tomorrow, I'll tell you about it tomorrow, but one beauty that's been caught was, and this was just recently, newly released, where they say having a dump. We're having a dump of all of those e-mails.
<TRUMP:> In another communication, Bill Clinton's chief of staff says foreign government -- right, this should be another one. Just like swamp -- you know the swamp little statement <ph> -- this one, this one. Do you remember what it is? Right? All the money is in, right? They said all the money is in. They're talking about foreign money pouring into their pockets. They said all the money is in. <BOOING> This is what is running for office. Honestly, she should be ashamed of herself. She should be ashamed of herself. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty to our government. That includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Makes sense. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will be saying right now. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. <APPLAUSE> Gonna drain the swamp. We're gonna drain the swamp, folks. We're gonna drain that swamp.
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!>
<TRUMP:> Another important issue for Americans is integrity in journalism. These people are among the most dishonest people I've ever met, spoken to, done business with. These are the most dishonest people. <BOOING> There has never been dishonesty -- there has never been dishonesty like we've seen in this election. There's never been anywhere near the media dishonesty like we've seen in this election. Don't worry, they won't spin the cameras and show the kind of massive crowds. They won't do that <ph>. <BOOING> The very talented Michael Goodwin of the New York Post just wrote today that 2016 presidential race will mark the low-water mark of journalism that is worthy -- think of it -- of the First Amendment. Never before have so many media organizations, old and new, abandoned all pretense of fairness to take sides and try to pick a president. <BOOING> It's unbelievable. It's unhonestly <ph>. For instance, we have a great story. We give it out to the media. They'll make it look as bad as possible -- as bad as possible. Parenthetically...
<AUDIENCE: CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!>
<TRUMP:> So sad. Parenthetically and very sadly, earnings for the New York Times are down 97 percent this year. They just announced that <ph>. So bad. I feel so badly for them. Just announced -- 97 percent. Oh, they're doing great. And then they tell you who to vote for, you know? Who to vote for. They want crooked Hillary. This isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country. And they're talking about it all over the world. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back jobs.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Right now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty. Forty-three percent of African- American school-aged children live in poverty. Thirty-two percent of Hispanic school-aged children live in poverty. This is America, this is the United States, this is unacceptable. As your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization. <APPLAUSE> We will replace decades of failure with generations of success. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary. <BOOING> And here's a number that you should remember because it's not even a believable number, and it's correct. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs left in the history of the world. Our jobs are going to Mexico, our jobs are going to other countries. China and others are making our product. We don't make it anymore. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. <APPLAUSE> My second home, you know that, I'm here all the time. My second home, great place. The theft of American prosperity will end. So they are stealing our prosperity, horribly stealing our prosperity. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we'll stand up to foreign product dumping all over the place. <APPLAUSE> Currency manipulation by China and many other countries and all of the unfair subsidy behavior that's going on all over the world against us. We will also immediately stop the job-killing, Trans- Pacific Partnership, a disaster. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary wants it to happen, she called it the gold standard, then she rejected it. But she's going to approve it. Then she lied during the debate, right? She lied. <BOOING> She lied during the debate. She said she never called it the gold standard, she lied. And she lied about the line in the sand, right? She lied. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> We will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations... <APPLAUSE> ... and use that money to support America's vital environmental infrastructure and natural resources. We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars. We don't even know who's doing what with the money. We're gonna spend the money here. We're gonna work on our own environment. <APPLAUSE> That includes repairing the Herbert Hoover Dike at Lake Okeechobee and protecting the Florida Everglades. <APPLAUSE> We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> A terrible tragedy today has occurred in Iowa. You read, you saw. Early this morning, two Iowa police officers, outstanding, outstanding people, were murdered, ambushed, ambushed violently while sitting in their squad cars. We send our thoughts and prayers to the family of the fallen. I just left Iowa, most beautiful place. The treatment was so incredible, the crowds, the police officers were so incredible the job they did. Now two of them are dead. An attack on our police is an attack on all of us. <APPLAUSE> Law enforcement is the line separating civilization from total chaos, you have to remember that. <APPLAUSE> According to the national law enforcement officers, Memorial Fund, firearm related police <inaudible> we're up 48 percent this year, the highest they've ever been. And there have been 14 ambush style attacks this year alone, never had anything like this. And what it is, is a lack of respect for our nation, it's a lack of respect for our leadership. To all the great men and women of law enforcement I want you to know, we're with you, we support you and we will stand by you. <APPLAUSE> We will restore law order and justice in America -- justice.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you, so good luck to the people of Iowa. We will also work with our federal and local law enforcements to keep America safe from terrorism. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our countries. <BOOING> Her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and all throughout your communities. When I'm president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program... <APPLAUSE> ... and we will keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of your community. <APPLAUSE> Now, we all have heart and we're gonna build safe zones and we're gonna have some of the Gulf States that have nothing but money, they'll put up the money, we'll lead it, we'll build safe zones. But we have enough problems in our country. She wants to increase the thousands and thousands that are pouring in right now. She wants to increase that number by 550 percent. And then, you wonder why Podesta says, she has bad instincts and you wonder why Bernie Sanders says, she's got bad judgment, they're right. She's got bad judgment, personally I think she's a very unstable person, if you wanna really know the truth. <APPLAUSE> And we're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare, but you wanna know something? Honestly, I think for herself she's got much bigger problems right now than Obamacare. She's got bigger problems. <APPLAUSE> Let's see what's on all those e-mails that they just found, see what's on those e-mails.
<AUDIENCE: Donald Trump! Donald Trump! Donald Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. It's too bad those cameras aren't turning around to see this incredible group of people with thousands more outside, isn't it too bad? <APPLAUSE> They don't do it. But you know, if Hillary speaks and there's 30 people in the line they say, the crowd is massive. <BOOING> She's never had a crowd like this in her life. <APPLAUSE> President Obama shouldn't be campaigning for any longer, it's really a conflict, right? He oughta be working on jobs, on the border, on building up our military instead of campaigning for crooked Hillary Clinton, is what he oughta be doing.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> He's in North Carolina, but we're going to North Carolina right after this, so. <APPLAUSE> But we have a few more today in Florida, and we have massive crowds. There's something happening. They're not reporting it. Katie, you're not reporting it, Katie. <APPLAUSE> But there's something happening, Katie. There's something happening, Katie. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build the wall. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> We've received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. <APPLAUSE> They tell us the border crisis taking place right now is the worst it's ever been. Now, in all fairness, people probably figure that I'm going to win. <APPLAUSE> So, they're racing across the border. I don't know. I'm sorry to do this to you, folks. <LAUGHTER> Hillary has pledged totally open borders, meaning you don't have a country anymore. And she strongly supports sanctuary cities like in San Francisco where... <BOOING> Right? Where Kate Steinle was killed by a five time deported illegal immigrant. <BOOING> The immigration officers warn that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives. And I believe that. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their countries would not take them back. <BOOING> Countless innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Last year, as an example, 17-year-old Starlett Pitts, her boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to death in their Lee High Acres home by an illegal immigrant. The killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery. And the people that knew him were begging that he be incarcerated. They were begging. He was released from custody pending his court appearance, enabling him to commit murder. A Trump administration will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and save American lives. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> And I want to thank, by the way, I see all these signs -- ""Cubans for Trump."" Cubans. I love Cubans. <APPLAUSE> So they gave me last week the Bay of Pigs Association, right? You know. They gave me their award last week and it was a great honor. And we're gonna fight very hard for the Cubans and we're gonna fight very, very hard for the Hispanics because they have not been properly taken care of.
<TRUMP:> What's happened with the Hispanic population in our country is not right. What's happened with the inner cities of our country, the African-American community, the Hispanic community, is very, very unfair. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you. We're going to take care of it. The crime is horrible, the education is terrible, and you can't get a job. We're going to fix the inner cities -- we're going to fix the inner cities. Thank you, fellows, that's so good. Blacks for Trump. That's so nice. We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. <APPLAUSE> That includes total support for homestead air reserve base. A Trump administration will stand in solidarity with the suffering people of Cuba and Venezuela all surrounding Dural <ph> -- all surrounding Dural <ph> against the oppression of the Castro and Maduro regimes, you know what I'm talking about. We will cancel Obama's one-sided Cuban deal made by Executive Order. If we do not get the deal we want, and the deal that people living in Cuba and here deserve... <APPLAUSE> ... including protecting religious and political freedom, right? I'm honored to have the endorsement of over 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. <APPLAUSE> You know it's really called peace through strength. Peace through strength, that's what we're going to have, well, hopefully. Have to get rid of ISIS -- we're going to get rid of ISIS, don't worry, we're getting rid of ISIS. But we have to get to rebuild our country. We've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East -- six trillion dollars. And it's in far worse shape, by a factor of 10, from when we started. Six trillion -- we lost lives, the most incredible, great people. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought disaster to Iraq and Syria and Libya. And she empowered Iran, remember, she's got bad judgment. And she unleashed ISIS, came right out of the vacuum. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Frankly, it could lead to World War III and she has no sense. She's got no instinct, but that's decided <ph>. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment, they've spent that six trillion dollars. I mean, I'd love to have that money back, but I'd much rather have all those lives back -- rather have all those lives. <APPLAUSE> Love to have those lives back. But the Middle East is in bad shape folks, and it's getting worse, totally getting worse. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And these are foreign wars that we don't win -- we don't win. We don't win anymore, we don't win with trade, we don't win with wars, we don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again, you watch. We're going to start. <APPLAUSE> To all Americans I say it's time for new leadership. Just think about what can be accomplished in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. <APPLAUSE> And she is going to raise your taxes very substantially, I think you know that.<BOOING>
<TRUMP:> We will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, cancel every illegal Obama executive order, rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. <APPLAUSE> Provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; we're bringing our education local. <APPLAUSE> Support the men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege... <APPLAUSE> ... and appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> Clinton wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change and wants our lives to revolve around Washington. I wonder if she's going to be there much longer. What do you think? <BOOING> I don't think so. I don't know. I'm not sure she's going to be there. But she wants -- she wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this great country. <APPLAUSE> I'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. <APPLAUSE> There is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics, certainly not the media. <BOOING> Hillary has been there for 30 years and she has accomplished nothing. She's just made things worse. Look at her record. She's the candidate of yesterday; we are the -- right? Is that right?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> We are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans and Democrats and independents and first time voters. And believe me, there are a lot of first time voters that are standing on line right now. <APPLAUSE> We're asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day. And I understand the other side very well. I've been there for a long time, but I love our country and I understand what has to be done. We are going in the wrong direction, and if we keep going in this direction, we won't have a country any longer. <BOOING> We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future. With your vote, we are just -- think of it -- six days away.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> This started on June 16th of last year. It's a long time. Seems like a long time ago. But we're six days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. It'll never happen again. It'll never, ever happen. It's not going to happen in four years. When I see Cubans for Trump, it'll never happen again. I'm telling you. This whole thing will never happen again. There's never been a movement like this in the history of our country -- there's never been a movement like this.
<AUDIENCE: We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. There has never been a movement like this in the history of our country -- it's never happened. Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump have said, it's the single greatest phenomena the have ever seen. We have to close the deal. We have to close -- get out and vote. November 8th fine, better if you vote now. Maybe you don't feel good November 8th, you don't want to get outta bed, you gotta get up, you gotta vote. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Get out and vote. God bless you, everybody. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-02"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. What a great honor, what a great crowd. <APPLAUSE> We're having a lot of fun. A lot of very, very big poll numbers coming down over the last few days. You've seen it. Big. <APPLAUSE> In six days, we're going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win the White House. We're going to win it. <APPLAUSE> It's feeling like it already, isn't it? We've got to be nice and cool. Nice and cool. <LAUGHTER> Right? Stay on point, Donald. Stay on point. <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> No sidetracks, Donald, nice and easy, nice. Because I've been watching Hillary the last few days, she's totally unhinged. We don't want any of that. <APPLAUSE> She has become unhinged. You've got to make sure to vote and to vote early if you can on November 8th. And I think -- who has voted already? <APPLAUSE> Whoa! Well, anybody that wants to leave right now to vote is OK. I'm only kidding. You'll vote tomorrow. <LAUGHTER> The new L.A. Times poll, highly respected, has us up six points nationwide. And I have some more really interesting and great breaking news to share with everyone here today. No, it's not that. <LAUGHTER> But that will be that. It's just been announced that in the month of October we've raised over $100 million in small donations. I don't think that's ever been done. Has that ever been done before? <APPLAUSE> That sounds more like a Democrat thing, not a Republican thing, right? That's a great honor. That means there are a lot of people out there that want us to really get this done. And I've contributed a tremendous amount of money, but when we have those small dollars, $61 and $52 and $17, when that money comes in and then we raise around $100 million that's a tremendous compliment to everybody here. It really is. It really is. These are donations from everyday patriotic Americans who love their country and want a better future for their children, who are going to have it. <APPLAUSE> Our movement is about borders and is about bringing back our jobs. You know about that from this area. <APPLAUSE> It's about reducing taxes and raising incomes. Our movement's about defeating ISIS. We have no choice. We have no choice. <APPLAUSE> We want to rebuild our country. But they're chopping off heads, they're drowning people in steel cages. We have no choice. And keeping our country safe from radical Islamic terrorism. <APPLAUSE> It's a movement about restoring respect for America and for the American flag. <APPLAUSE> We're disrespected right now all over the world. But that will change very, very quickly. It really will. It really will. We'll get along with a lot of countries that right now we do not get along with and that frankly take advantage of us. From now on, it will be America first, folks. America first. <APPLAUSE> Finally, it's a movement about taking our government back.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. There's an amazing love for our country. I see it all over this great land.
<AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. I love you, too. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> It's a movement about taking our government back from the donors, the lobbyists and the special interests and giving that power back to the people. <APPLAUSE> And in case you didn't know, I've been on the other side for a long time. And I saw where the country was going. It was headed in the wrong direction. And I love this country and I just said we're going to have to do it. It's not easy. It's not easy. I have to put up with some of the most dishonest people in the world, the media. <BOOING> They never show crowds like that. Look at that, it goes all the way back. They never show crowds. They don't show crowds. <APPLAUSE> But I guarantee you one thing, folks. I guarantee you one thing. If we had a small crowd, if for some reason a little small group of people showed up, it would be the biggest story out there. That I can tell you. <LAUGHTER> These are really dishonest people. And they are not happy with what's going -- this was not in their game plan, folks. They are not happy. <APPLAUSE> Dishonest media, among the most dishonest people. And I was sad to see The New York Times lost 97 percent, down profits 97 percent. <APPLAUSE> Ninety-seven percent down and then they tell you who they want for president, right? We know better. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing ""Obamacare."" <APPLAUSE> It's just been announced that the residents of Florida, hate to tell you this, are going to experience massive, double-digit premium hikes. I know what those hikes are. <BOOING> Should I tell you? Let's keep it -- I want you to leave happy tonight knowing that we're going to make America great again, OK? <APPLAUSE> And in the very near future, it's going to be gone, ""Obamacare,"" so don't worry. But I won't tell you what the number is. You're not going to be happy when you hear the number. In the great state of Arizona, premiums are going up more than 116 percent. I just left Arizona, great people, unbelievable place. Their premiums are going up more than 116 percent. All of the counties in the Florida Panhandle will have only one single ""Obamacare"" insurer to choose from next year. Good luck with that negotiation. Not so lucky. Don't worry, don't worry, it's going to be gone fast. But think of it. Now, do you know how much they're going to make? This is what they dream of. They all wanted to be on, they're all gone, they're all gone, you're going to have one to deal with. It's a disaster. In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor has said, and he's gotten a lot of heat for saying this, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. That was last week. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof. Other than that, it's actually quite good. <LAUGHTER> What a shame. And I said it from the -- I've said a lot of things from the beginning, you have to say. You know, they said about Hillary she's got bad instincts, right? You know who said that? Podesta. I would fire Podesta so fast. I mean, the way he talks about her, you know, whether true, not true, who cares? He speaks so badly about her. Of course, he didn't know that there was a thing called WikiLeaks, right? He didn't know about that. <APPLAUSE> But he said she's got bad instincts and she does have bad, very bad instincts. And Bernie Sanders, what did he say? Got bad judgment, she's got bad judgment. She's got bad instincts, she's got bad judgment. That's not going to be your president. If we don't get rid of ""Obamacare,"" it will destroy American health care forever, yet Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on ""Obamacare,"" making it much more expensive than it already is. <BOOING> I'm asking for your vote so we can replace ""Obamacare"" and save health care for every family in Florida and the United States. <APPLAUSE> Real change also means restoring honesty to government. Do you think Hillary's going to restore honesty to government? I don't know. <BOOING> I don't think so, folks. As you know, the FBI has reopened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> All right. Is your sound turned back up? <LAUGHTER> You know what they do, they turn the sound down when you're doing that. Are you guys back? Did you put your sound back up? <LAUGHTER> Hillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up an illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. Hillary is the one who endangered national security for you, your family by sending classified information on an insecure server. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena. That's after, after. Unbelievable. But I have a feeling those 650,000 -- 650,000 e-mails -- I have a feeling those e-mails are going to be -- whoa, there are going to be some beauties in there. Can you imagine? She's been deleting all the time, deleting, and then they say, yeah, we have a problem. What? They just found 650,000 e-mails. Now, you can't have 650,000 for the wedding and for the yoga, right? You can't, it's too many. <LAUGHTER> No, that's a big number. You know, when you hear that many e- mails, then you wonder why she never gets anything done. I guess that's part of the reason. Hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her by Donna Brazile... <BOOING> ... in advance of a debate, and now it's turned out to be two debates with Bernie Sanders. Can you imagine Bernie Sanders? If that happened to me, it probably did, although we won the debates anyway. I don't think it matters. I don't think it matters. <APPLAUSE> But can you imagine that Bernie Sanders keeps supporting her? I think eventually he's going to say I can't do it. I mean, honestly, if somebody got the debate questions on me and I found out about it, and they only found out about it through this whole deal with WikiLeaks, but if somebody found out that for me, I would never want to be speaking with that person again. I would imagine it's only a question of time, hopefully before the election, that Bernie Sanders says that's one of the most dishonest acts because Hillary never reported it as a breach. She got the questions and she never reported it. And they don't say that, these people. All they do is talk about Donna Brazile. Who cares about Donna Brazile? Who cares about her? It's not Donna Brazile. She was dishonest. By the way, did you see her on television the other night trying to answer that one? That was called choking. Let me out of the studio, please. <LAUGHTER> Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, what a country. But we're going to make it respected again, we're going to make it great again, I'm telling you. <APPLAUSE> But hopefully at some point, Bernie Sanders will do the right thing. And some of his people have told me, how can he continue to support her when she cheated -- when she cheated -- on the debates. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. And if she were elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. You know what's going to happen. And in all fairness, we went through it with the husband, he was impeached. His law license was taken. You know, he can't represent you. If you want a lawyer, you can't even use him, his license was taken away. Folks, do we want to go through this again?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> And do we want for more years of Obama? That's what it's going to be.
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> You know what that means? ISIS running around all over the place, higher taxes, no borders, a depleted military. No, we're going to change it around. Hillary is likely to be under investigation for many years, probably concluding in criminal trials. <APPLAUSE> And through WikiLeaks today, it's just been shown that this is, as I've been saying, a rigged system with more collusion, possibly illegal, between the Justice Department, the Clinton campaign and the State Department. Right? You saw that, just came out. The e-mails show that the assistant attorney general, who is involved in the investigation, has been feeding information directly to John Podesta, who he knows very well, and the Clinton campaign. Folks, folks, it's a rigged system, OK? It's a rigged system. Then they say, oh, isn't that terrible when Donald Trump, you know, like -- it's a rigged system. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption. <APPLAUSE> It includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. I think we can keep them out. We have enough problems with our elections, let's keep them out. My plan also includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. <APPLAUSE> I want the entire corruption Washington establishment to hear and heed the words we all have to say -- we all. And by the way, folks, I'm a messenger, I'm just a messenger. This is a movement like they've never seen. By the way, I have been an effective messenger, in all fairness, but that also. <APPLAUSE> But I'm a messenger, I'm a messenger. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp.
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Believe me. I told people, you know, over the last week- and-a-half ago that came out. I said I can't say that, that is so hokey. <LAUGHTER> I said I'm not going to say it. Anyway, so a week-and-a-half ago I said it. The place went crazy. I said, whoa. Then I said it at the next meeting, we had a tremendous rally someplace, and I said it. And the place went totally crazy. <APPLAUSE> And then I said it again, same thing, and then I said to myself, boy, I'm glad I thought of that expression, that's a great expression. <LAUGHTER> I tell this story. Frank Sinatra, Frank Sinatra didn't like ""My Way."" He didn't like ""My Way,"" but he sang it and the place went nuts. Then he did it again and again and again, then it became number one. And you know what? He decided he loves that song very much. <LAUGHTER> At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. <APPLAUSE> Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> Here's a fact that's so hard to even fathom. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed deal. And I have to say about China, I do a lot of business with China, I do a lot of business with China. We can do great with China. And I don't disrespect them, I'm not angry at them because they've taken advantage of our country, I'm angry at our leaders for allowing them to do it. <APPLAUSE> Our leaders have allowed them to manipulate their currency, devalue their currency. They're masters, they're grand masters. Nobody's ever done it like China. Others do it. Japan does it brilliantly also, but nobody's ever done to us what China has. And we have -- the biggest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in Manhattan, it's a China bank. It's the number-one bank in the world. And I do business with China in the Bank of America building in San Francisco through China and so many things. And dealing with China is fine. But you have to have people that are knowing what they're doing because what China has done to our country, they have taken our money, they have taken our jobs, they make our product and we owe them $1.6 trillion. That's sort of amazing, right? They take our money and we owe them. So that'll all change. And you know the amazing thing? Now in the South China Sea they're building a massive, massive fortress, probably like nobody's ever seen, right in the middle of the sea. And I don't think they asked for environmental impact statements, do you? Do you think they went through the two-year review period?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> You know what they went through? About a 15-minute review period. But they're building right in the middle of the South China Sea. They shouldn't be doing that. And we treat them very well because we let them do all these things that we could stop very easily. And by the way, we have tremendous power, but we don't know how to use it. So we're going to get along better with China. We're going to get along better with Mexico, what Mexico is doing to us, between the border and the kind of trade deficits we have with Mexico. And by the way, so many other countries. We're going to be the smart people again. We're going to be the smart people again. <APPLAUSE> We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, we really are. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. <APPLAUSE> The theft of American prosperity will end. They're taking away our wealth. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to product dumping, unfair subsidies and currency manipulation. And we'll win, we'll win. It won't even be hard. <APPLAUSE> We will end the foreign cheating and protect every last American job. We will also immediately stop the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership that Hillary Clinton would love. <APPLAUSE> That'll be the end of your jobs completely. That's a disaster, certainly the way it's structured is a total disaster. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> We will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations. <APPLAUSE> And we will use that money for American, and it's so important, for American environmental infrastructure. We want, folks, we want clean air, crystal, we want clean water, crystal. I want crystal- clean water, clean air. We want safety. Beyond that, that's what we want. The rest of the world, they take our money, they laugh at us. Our businesses can no longer compete because some of the restrictions. We want clean air, we want clean water, we want safety. We spend billions and billions of dollars. <APPLAUSE> And we'll be replacing, unless you don't want to do it, the 3- Mile Bridge. Do you want to do that? Do you care? Because if you don't care, let's save the money, OK? Should we do it or not? Tell me, should we do it? <APPLAUSE> Well, you're more excited about building the wall, that I can see. <APPLAUSE> And we will unleash the power of American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. We're going to put our miners back to work. And we're going to put our steelworkers back to work. <APPLAUSE> We will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees... <BOOING> ... and virtually unlimited immigration from the most dangerous places in the world to come into our country. Her plan would mean generations of terrorism, radicalism and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. <APPLAUSE> And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country, I can tell you that. We've got enough problems. <APPLAUSE> We have enough problems. And you know what? We all have a heart and we see what's going on, the world is unbelievable what's happening. And we'll build safe havens and we'll get the money from the Gulf states, they have so much money they don't know what to do with it and they haven't exactly been putting up. So we'll get the money from -- we owe $20 trillion. If you don't mind, I'm going to low-key it a little bit, OK? Does that sound OK to everybody?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> But we'll get the money to the area. We'll get it over there. And we'll build safe havens.
<AUDIENCE MEMBER: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> I think he's on our side, that guy, right? I always say, friend or foe? Usually it's friend, other than the ones that the Clintons hired, the thugs, right, for $1,500 apiece. <BOOING> $1,500 and a cell phone, go and try and beat up as many people as you can. Remember that, around Chicago? And then they're blaming me, Donald Trump's rallies are very, very violent. And you hardly heard about that story. And honestly, those people should be prosecuted. You had policemen walking out with gashes in their head. Those people should be prosecuted because we have the friendliest rallies, we have such love at our rallies. Those people should be prosecuted. <APPLAUSE> Did you see the guy who was in charge of that program? Visited the White House, like, 344 times. Did you see that? <BOOING> He visited the White House, I think it was 344 times, right? But he said, yeah, but I only saw the president 44 times. Oh, well, that's OK. So I'm sure the president didn't know anything about the violence, right? And he's got to stop campaigning for crooked Hillary. He's got to go back, go to the office and he's got to produce jobs and he's got to help the military build up. I mean, depleted. He's got to look at the borders. I mean, this guy, all he wants to do is campaign for Hillary, it's unbelievable. I think he may be hurting her more. Look, the bottom line is nobody wants four more years of Obama. <BOOING> A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build what? We're going to build the wall.
<AUDIENCE: The wall!>
<TRUMP:> And here's a little quiz. I'm sure you're never going to be able to guess this. Who is going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> How did you guess? They don't know it yet, but they're paying for the wall. We received the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers, a tremendous number of people, first time they've ever done it. <APPLAUSE> The immigration officers warned that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history and that it will ""lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives."" That's a quote. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton allowed many, many people, the most dangerous and violent criminals, aliens, to go free because their home countries intelligently said we don't want them back and we're not going to take them back. So our guys would be over, they'd bring them there, they'd say we don't want them, we're not taking them, get out. And she'd accept them back and then put them on the streets. And you know what's happened, you know what's happened. I promise you this, whether it's four years or eight years, not once, when we bring criminals back to a country, not once will that country say take them back. Not once, believe me. <APPLAUSE> Not once. Hillary wants totally open borders, there goes your country, and has pledged mass amnesty in her first 100 days. Very unfair to all of the people that want to come in. And by the way, I want people to come in. I want tremendous numbers of people to come in. And we're going to have that big, beautiful door in the wall. But you know what? They have to come in through a process, they have to come in legally. <APPLAUSE> They have to come in legally. And we'll have merit involved, too. Wouldn't it be nice if we went a little bit on the merit system, we take people that are really going to help us grow our country? Wouldn't that be nice? <APPLAUSE> Somebody said you can't say that, that's not politically correct. Well, I just said it, folks. <APPLAUSE> Hillary strongly supports sanctuary cities, like San Francisco... <BOOING> ... where incredible Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported as least five times. A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. <APPLAUSE> We will end illegal immigration, keep the drugs from pouring into our communities and deport all criminal aliens from our country. We will also fully eliminate the Obama-Clinton defense cuts and completely rebuild our badly depleted military, which we desperately need. <APPLAUSE> That includes brand-new, modern aircraft for Pensacola Naval Air Station. Wouldn't that be nice for your great, young pilots? <APPLAUSE> I watched a documentary a couple of months ago and I saw that. It was a documentary on how old our aircraft is, our fighter craft. And they can't get parts, they don't make parts anymore. These are fighters that we're currently using. These great, great people that fly these planes, they can't get parts because they don't make them anymore. They get the parts from the museums, they get the parts from the airplane graveyards. And I said, this the United States? The enemy has plans that are far better than ours, so we're going to change all of that. So get ready, get ready, Pensacola. <APPLAUSE> And we will always ensure that the Blue Angels -- I love the Blue Angels... <APPLAUSE> ... continue to inspire our nation, the Blue Angels. I mean, those guys are serious fliers. I never quite -- when the wings are that -- I never quite got it, but they have great talent, no different than anything else. They're great, they're blessed with great, great talent. We will also build the 350-ship Navy that our country has been asking for and our admirals have been asking for. <APPLAUSE> And we'll have an active duty Army of 540,000 troops. <APPLAUSE> Our military policy will be based on three very important words: Peace through strength. <APPLAUSE> We don't want to use it. We want to have it, we don't want to use it. We do have to get rid of ISIS, folks, but we don't want to use it other than that. I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients, and a lot more coming. A lot more coming. <APPLAUSE> Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria and Libya. She empowered Iran and she unleashed ISIS. You ever notice where she says we will fight ISIS, during the debates? You know, then she walks out, and not good, not good. She left, wasn't good. But she's going to fight ISIS; she's the one that let it start. So ISIS started as nothing, then Obama called it the junior varsity, you remember, and now it's in 32 countries. And she's going to stop it? Next, Hillary wants to start a shooting war in the Syrian conflict with a nuclear-armed opponent named Russia, that could seriously lead over Syria to World War III. And Putin does not like her and she is just not respected.
<AUDIENCE MEMBER: We don't like her either! (LAUGHTER)>
<TRUMP:> That was quite funny. The woman screams, ""We don't like her either!"" <LAUGHTER> Who said that? That's pretty cool. Who said it? You? You look so innocent, I can't believe it. Wow, we don't like her either. No, we need strength. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, wars that we never win, wars that just cause death destruction. We never win. We don't win anymore. We don't win with wars. We don't win with trade. We don't win. We're going to start winning again like you haven't won in a long time. <APPLAUSE> And now the Middle East, after spending this $6 trillion -- $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice -- and now the Middle East is in worse shape than it's ever been before. It's a mess. I mean, it's not even, it's not even, it's far worse than it ever was. They've dragged us into these endless foreign wars that have made us much less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. To all Americans I say it's time immediately for new leadership, it is. <APPLAUSE> And just in closing, think, think we're all leaders, we're all doing this together.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with you tonight, I have to tell you. This is a great area. This is an amazing area. Somebody said, oh, that's Trump all the way, that whole area. I love this area. This is an amazing area. <APPLAUSE> They did a poll of your area and I'll tell you we are through the roof. <APPLAUSE> In fact, I have to be honest, my geniuses said, Mr. Trump, sir, don't come there, everyone's voting for you there. You don't need to go there, you've got their vote. I said that's why I want to go there. Don't you want to reward people for being your friend, right? <APPLAUSE> Don't go there? I want to go here. It's true. See, people forget, you know, it's one of those things. I want to be here. This is -- I think you people are amazing. You built this country, folks. You built this country. <APPLAUSE> Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to massively cut taxes for the working and middle-class Americans. Hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially, by the way. It's right there. <BOOING> We will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We will cancel illegal and, you know, it's crazy, the illegal Obama executive orders. They're all over the place. They're pretty bad. <APPLAUSE> We will rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. <APPLAUSE> We are going to provide school choice and put an end to Common Core, bring our education local. <APPLAUSE> We will support the great men and women of law enforcement. I met a lot of them backstage. We'll save our Second Amendment which is totally under siege. Got to get out and vote, that's a big thing. <APPLAUSE> The National Rifle Association gave me their earliest endorsement that they've ever given. And Wayne and Chris and all of the people there, I want to tell you folks, people can dispute, people can argue, but they love this country. The National Rifle Association, and I know the top people, they love this country, they really do. They love the country, so just remember that. When people go after them and, you know, so often, but they really do have a great love. And I want to appoint and we're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> The time has come to cut our ties with the failed, petty policies of the past. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and she's accomplished nothing. She's just made things worse. During our debate, she complained about my taxes. I said, Hillary, you were there, change it, but she won't do that because all of her donors do the same thing as I do, so she's never going to do it. So I felt very strongly, I said, Hillary, you've been there for years, change it. She's not going to change it. She doesn't do anything. She complains, she complains. She's the candidate of yesterday, we are the movement of the future. <APPLAUSE> We're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, independents and first-time voters of which we have a lot of them, I'm telling you. We have a lot. <APPLAUSE> All you have to do is look at those long, beautiful lines all over Florida and you're going to see a lot of them have hats that have a little phrase, right? What does that phrase say? ""Make America great."" Those lines are long and there's -- by the way, last poll has us up four, but I think they really know it's much higher than that, you know. They don't even have to poll now, all they have to do is look at the lines, right? They don't want to do that. We're asking all Americans to join this incredible movement. We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hopes and prays and yearns for a much better future. We're going to bring back our jobs, folks. We're going to bring back our jobs. <APPLAUSE> I'm asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just, do you believe this, six days away. Six days. <APPLAUSE> Six days. I started this in June, June 16th of last year. It seemed like it would take forever. Of course, you know, the pundits all said Donald Trump has no chance, he's got no experience at this. <BOOING> Well, every once in a while some of them that knew us, they'd say be careful what you wish for. A couple of them said it, I won't mention their names, but I was complimented. They said be careful. And then one by one, right, one by one by one by one. And then we have some great people. Ben Carson has been so incredible. <APPLAUSE> So many, Chris Christie has been great. But we have great support. Mike Huckabee, I watched him on television the other day, he's been so great. <APPLAUSE> No, no, we have great support. We have great support. But one by one, now we're only left with one person, crooked Hillary Clinton. We're going to win. We're going to win. <BOOING> <APPLAUSE> So we're just six days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and...
<AUDIENCE: We will make America great again! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> That's right, we will make America great again! Thank you, God bless you, everybody. God bless you!","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-02"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody, thank you. Wow. These crowds.
<AUDIENCE MEMBERS: USA! USA! USA! >
<TRUMP:> These crowds are terrific. Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida. And we are going to win back the White House. That will happen. But you have to get out, you have to vote, we have to get out there. We don't want to blow it. That I can tell you because we have worked very hard, all of us, you, me, everybody. And it's very historic what's happening. I'd like to begin today by thanking all of you for joining me. This has been an incredible journey and we've all done it together. We're almost at the end. <APPLAUSE> But we're really at the end of the beginning if you think about it. Aren't we? The end of the beginning. Our magnificent history movement has surprised the world and defied expectations at every single turn. And now, next Tuesday, we will have one last glorious surprise for the pundits, the politicians and the special interests and return the power back to the people. It's going to happen. <APPLAUSE> It's going to happen. It's been the honor of my life share this journey with you, it has absolutely been. <APPLAUSE> There are two people, however, who I did not really get to share this with but who are in my thoughts often. And that's my mother and my father, great people. <APPLAUSE> I had great parents. Great parents. I know they're up there watching, I just felt that nice breeze. It's hot, but I just felt that nice breeze... <APPLAUSE> ... so they're helping us out. And I just want to say thank you to both of them. Special, special people. I've had a great life and now I want to give back to the country that I love. It's time, we have to -- we have to give back, folks <ph>... <APPLAUSE> I've seen how the career of politicians, the big donors and the special interests have bled this country dry and stripped our middle class and stripped our companies of its jobs and its wealth. But we're just six days away from delivering justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country... <APPLAUSE> Justice for every child trapped in poverty in the inner cities, for every family that's born -- and you know that, they've been born into a situation in some case; they can't get out of it. We're going to get them out of it. We're going to get them out of it. We have endless wars. Every community's hopes and dreams have been shattered and we're not going to let that happen. Our inner cities are going to come back and <ph> they're going to come back strong and your going to see what I mean. <APPLAUSE> And the African-American community and the Hispanic community are really understanding what's going on and you see that right now. You see that right now in <ph> what's happening at the polls. We're winning in Florida, we're winning in Ohio, we're winning in Iowa, in North Carolina. We're doing great in Pennsylvania. A lot of people are saying Pennsylvania's looking very good. So many different places. We just got a poll <ph> with three <ph> up <ph> in Virginia. <APPLAUSE> But we are seriously up in Florida. That's very important, so... <APPLAUSE> And I will never, ever let you down. Real change begins immediately with repealing and replacing Obamacare, a <ph> disaster. <APPLAUSE> A disaster. <APPLAUSE> It is a disaster. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. <BOOING> I will not tell you what the number is. I know the number very well, but I want you to leave happy. You don't want to hear the number, go home, relax, wake up good and strong tomorrow morning. You'll learn, you're not going to like it. In the great state of Arizona, where we just left, the <ph> premiums are going up more than 116 percent. <BOOING> Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida -- and by the way, in the primaries, I won 66 out of 67 primaries. That's good. <CHEERING> I was going to try and exaggerate and say I won them all, but I can't do <ph> that <ph>. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers next year, they're leaving. They're all leaving. In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Obamacare is a total catastrophe.
<AUDIENCE: Yeah!>
<TRUMP:> Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Florida, so important. <APPLAUSE> Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. <APPLAUSE> As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into crooked Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> Hillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and I don't see if you've watched her last few speeches over the last few days. She has become totally unhinged, unbelievable. What she's saying and what she's doing is actually, it's unbelievable. But she has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State Department. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI. Hilary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer and who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after -- after, after, after receiving a congressional subpoena, think of that. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> Unbelievable. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> And as you know, they just found -- listen to this and I guess you know it, 650,000 e-mails. <AUDIENCE BOOS> 
<TRUMP:> And I would say that classified, confidential, I think they're probably all over the place. I think they're -- I think they're gonna find a treasure trough. I can't even imagine. In fact, they said well, this is OK they're duplicates. How could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place, right? You know, when they deleted 33,000 I thought that was a lot. They have 650,000? Hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> Instead of reporting the breach. That's a big deal. You know, to me that's a big deal. Some people say oh, that's fine, that's a big deal. That's really -- that's a real cheater, OK? That's a cheater. And she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the DNC or be fired. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> But that's a really big deal. And you notice, they never -- the dishonest prospect, the most dishonest <inaudible>. <AUDIENCE BOOS>
<TRUMP:> If you notice, they never go after Hillary. They always talk about Donna Brazile, Donna Brazile didn't do it. But can you imagine if I got -- can you imagine, they gave the questions to Donald Trump before a debate. <APPLAUSE> You know it would be the electric chair. They'd reinstitute the electric chair. No. It'd be headlines all over the world. This isn't headlines. I bring it up; it's brought up a little bit. But this isn't like a big deal. She got the debate questions and answers. But she got the debate questions prior to a debate. Now, Bernie Sanders should be angry right? Shouldn't he be angry? Now, I'll tell you what. The system is rigged. The system is rigged. I've been saying it for a -- it's rigged, and we're gonna straighten it out. But the system is rigged. Hillary is not the victim; the American people are the victims of this system. <APPLAUSE> So corrupt in so many ways. And this is your one chance to change it because you know what? In four years, not gonna happen. There's no way. The numbers won't work. In four years, there's no way. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. And if she were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. I mean before you go into phase two -- let's call what happened on Friday phase two. Phase one, she's so guilty. She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency. That's why I say the system is rigged. She shouldn't be allowed to run. But I have a feeling in the 650,000 e-mails, they're gonna find things that you will not even believe. Who knows. 650,000 e-mails. No wonder she can't do anything. No, no. How do you work? How do you do it? 650,000. They'll have to explain that to us some day. But they'll have some things in there that I can just imagine are going to be unbelievable. Hillary's likely to be under investigation for many years. Probably concluding in a criminal trial. Out today, WikiLeaks just came out with a new one. Just a little while ago. It's just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion, possibly illegal between the Department of Justice, the Clinton campaign, and the State Department. You saw that. The e-mails show that the Assistant Attorney General who's involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to John Podesta and the Clinton campaign. Can you believe this? <BOOING> She shouldn't be allowed to run. By the way, behind me, the great Johnny Damon. The curse of the Yankees, but ultimately he helped the Yankees. Johnny Damon. Stand up <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> Now, I'll tell ya. George Steinbrenner was a good friend of mine. Oh, he didn't like Johnny too much. Then he ultimately signed him and then he was fine. He did great. But Johnny Damon was a champ. He was a winner. And he loves this area, you know that. My contract with the American voter begins with a tough ethics reform, and it ends -- I'll tell you what. We are going to end -- we have no choice. We really have no choice -- government corruption. It's going to end. <APPLAUSE> I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will say right now when we win on November 8. We are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. <APPLAUSE> At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton with the support of crooked Hillary. <BOOING> America has lost -- this is so hard to believe -- 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. They're leaving. We're going to stop it. And you have an excellent governor, by the way. He's fighting hard for you folks. I don't know -- I don't know. All I can tell you is he is a worker, he is a worker, and he's fighting very hard. The theft of American prosperity will end and it'll end, I'll tell you. We are -- it is being stolen from us folks. It is -- we have a one-way highway right into Mexico, right into other countries. And we're going to stop it. From now on, it's going to be America first. <APPLAUSE> America first. <APPLAUSE> It's going to be America first.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and all of the unfair subsidy behaviors. It's horrible what's happening to us. Our politicians don't have a clue, they don't know what they're doing -- or other things, OK. We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Killing our jobs. Our companies are leaving. Killing our jobs. We will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. In Orlando, the murder rate doubled, you know that? Doubled last year. Can you believe it? We will support our police, and I met you police of Orlando, they are unbelievable people and they've been through a lot. I met the police and these are unbelievable people. We will bring this crime wave to an end. We will also keep our community safe from terrorism. Just a short time ago, Orlando was the victim of the worst mass shooting in American history during the Islamic terror attack on The Pulse nightclub. It was also the worst attack on the LGBTQ community in our country's history. Can't let it happen, can't let it happen. Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent Syrian refugees pouring into our country <BOOING>. Her plan would mean generations of terrorism, radicalism, and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refuge program. <APPLAUSE> And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your community. <APPLAUSE> Got to keep them out. And we'll build safe zones in Syria. We have to help the people. We're going to build safe zones, but the Gulf States haven't been doing their thing. And believe me, they have plenty of money. They'll help us, they'll fund it, I'm sure they'll be thrilled. They're going to be funding it, and that will be OK. We want to help people. But we have enough problems in this country. We don't need Orlando and problems. We don't need what happened in San Bernadino. We don't need what's happening in Paris, in Nice and in Germany -- which is a disaster. We don't need it. We have enough problems right now, do we agree? We have enough problems. We don't need it. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. <APPLAUSE> And yes, we will build a great wall. <APPLAUSE> 
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!>
<TRUMP:> We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers, great people. The officers that warned that Hillary's plan is the most quote, radical immigration proposal in United States history, and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, quote. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries were intelligent, they wouldn't take them back. We bring them to their countries -- murderers, drug dealers, gang members, we'd bring them to their countries and their countries would say: get them out, we're not taking them back. They call up the State Department, and the State Department under Hillary Clinton would say: oh, bring them back, we don't want to make waves. I guarantee you, whether it's four years or eight years, that will not happen once under a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> Hillary wants totally open borders and strongly supports sanctuary cities. Like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle -- incredible young woman -- was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities immediately. We will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens -- the ones we just spoke about -- and we will save American lives. We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our very badly depleted military. <APPLAUSE> That includes major new investments in resources from Pensacola Naval Air Station at MacDill Air Force Base. Have you ever heard of those places? Pretty good places. A lot of people here, lot of people. I'm honored to have the endorsement of 200 -- more than that now, much more than that -- top Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. Great people, I've met so many of them, they're incredible. Incredible people. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spend $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never won and that never end. And it's now in worse shape than ever before. The Middle East is a catastrophe, it's far worse off than had we spent nothing. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home. And they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And it's -- it's disappearing. Our country, in a certain sense, is disappearing. Prosperity -- real prosperity is disappearing. We owe $20 trillion. Our trade deals, we lose $800 billion a year on trade. We have trade deficits. Think of that. Who negotiates these deals? You know who does? Stupid people. Stupid people. <APPLAUSE> With very stupid leadership. Who, by the way, they campaign all the time. He's campaigning right now for crooked Hillary. <BOOING> Why is he campaigning? She's under federal investigation, and we've got a president campaigning for her. And that's all he does is campaign. He ought to be working on your jobs that are leaving and going to Mexico. And your military. <APPLAUSE> I'll tell you what, first of all, she's got bigger problems. But four more years of Obama, we can't take it, folks. Four more years of ISIS, that's what it is. Four more years of no jobs. Now, she wants to start a shooting war in Syria and conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III. Russia is heavily armed, doesn't like her. Putin does not respect her, doesn't like her. What are we doing, folks? She's a mess. To all Americans, I say it's time for new leadership. <APPLAUSE> Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. It's so beautiful over there. I just noticed the water. Let's go in for a swim. It's about 200 degrees out there. Anybody want to go swimming? Let's go. <APPLAUSE> We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. And Hillary wants to increase your taxes by a tremendous amount. You know, we're already the highest-taxed nation in the world. She wants to increase your taxes, if you can believe that one. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. Killing your companies. Killing them. One of the reasons they're leaving. Cancel every illegal Obama executive order. <APPLAUSE> We're going to rebuild our military and take care of our great, great veterans. They're not being taken care of. You know that. A lot of veterans here. We're going to take care of our veterans finally. They have been mistreated for many, many years. We're going to support the men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We will save the Second Amendment which is, as you know, under tremendous siege. <APPLAUSE> We will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> We will show the world that there is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. There's no dream -- no dream outside of our reach. We have all these people telling us what to do. Politicians -- they know nothing. I've dealt with them all my life, folks. All talk, no action. <inaudible>, I have some friends that are politicians. So let me just say there's some good ones. OK? There are some good. I'll tell you what, you take a look at the media. These are the most dishonest people anywhere. <BOOING> These are the most -- they -- the media -- the media is a part and one of the vital cogs in the rigged system under which we live. They're a big fat cog in the -- and they never show the crowds. They never show what's happening. But you know what? You hear -- when you hear 20,000, sometimes 30,000, when you hear people, sounds like you're at an Ohio State football game. <APPLAUSE> But they never show it. They never show it. <APPLAUSE> They never show it. People of Florida, we love you. All we have to do is cut our ties with these failed politicians of the past. Hillary is a candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are. <APPLAUSE> We're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, independents and first-time voters, of which we're finding out there are many. You probably heard over the last couple of weeks ""Texas is in play""; ""Texas -- that Georgia is in play."" And I'm saying, ""Gee, that's too bad."" <ph> Let me tell you, they're setting records in Texas, and they're voting for Trump, just so you understand that. <APPLAUSE> And they know it. <APPLAUSE> But when they see those numbers coming, they don't want to announce them. But we are winning almost everywhere. I think -- give us two more days, I think we're going to be winning everywhere. <APPLAUSE> And I'm almost starting to think that the least important problem that Hillary has is the fact that we're winning. I think she's got perhaps bigger problems than even that. <APPLAUSE> We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and nor Hillary's special interests. <APPLAUSE> We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future. <APPLAUSE> I am asking you to dream big -- I got to dream big. Because with your vote, we are just -- can you believe this? -- six days away. Think of that. <APPLAUSE> From the change you've been waiting for your entire life. <APPLAUSE> We're going to work together. We're going to vote. You're going to vote now or you're going to vote by the 8th. But you're going to vote.
<UNKNOWN: You're going to win.>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. I love that guy. He's a tough guy, but he just screamed out, ""You're going to win."" We're going to win. Thank you, man. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> We have great, great love. You know, we're in a divided nation. We are a divided nation. We're not going to be divided. We're going to have such love in this country. We're going to have such love and such respect. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. <APPLAUSE> We will make America safe again. <APPLAUSE> And we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much. Thank you, folks. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-03"">
<TRUMP:> Great crowd, thank you very much, thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> In five days, we are going to win the great state of Florida, and we are going to win back the White House. <APPLAUSE> Just out a few minutes ago, the new Rasmussen Poll has up 3 up right now, 3 up nationwide. <APPLAUSE> We're leading in Florida, we're leading in Ohio, we're leading in Iowa, I think we're leading in North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> Which is big. Doing well in Pennsylvania right there, but we are leading all over. I tell you what, we are going to have something that's going to be very special, get out there on Tuesday, don't fail. Who has already voted by the way? <APPLAUSE> That's pretty good. It's about 82 percent. <APPLAUSE> Got to vote. We're on the cusp of something that's so amazing, it's historic change, a transfer of power from a failed political establishment. We're going to return that power to you, the American people. <APPLAUSE> There is more breaking news that I'd like to share with you right now. <APPLAUSE> It was reported last night that the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's -- <APPLAUSE> -- pay for play corruption during her tenure as secretary of state. In other words, the FBI is investigating how Hillary Clinton put the office of secretary of state up for sale in violation of federal law. <BOOING> The investigation is described as a high priority. <APPLAUSE> It's far-reaching, and has been going on for more than one year. It was reported that an avalanche of information is coming in. <APPLAUSE> The FBI agents say their investigation is likely to yield an indictment. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> But just remember, the system is rigged, just remember that. <BOOING> And reports also show the political leadership at the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton, and is interfering with the FBI's criminal investigation. <BOOING> By comparison, four-star general just last week, James Cartwright, highly respected, is in very serious trouble for doing a tiny fraction of what Clinton did, may go to jail for up to five years. Think of it, General Cartwright, last week, four-star general, respected by everybody, a tiny, tiny fraction, may go to jail for now five years. And General Petraeus' life and reputation has been destroyed for doing nothing, nothing by comparison to what Hillary Clinton did. She shouldn't even be allowed to run for the office of president. <APPLAUSE> She shouldn't be allowed. And that is where the system is rigged. She shouldn't be allowed. It was also reported that the laptops of Clinton's top aides, which had been slated for destruction, were not in fact destroyed. Good job by the FBI. <APPLAUSE> And that the FBI has been successfully using them to gather information for their criminal investigation. <APPLAUSE> Further, they have found new e-mails as part of the 650,000 e- mails just recently found. Can you imagine 650,000? See, what do these people do? No wonder nothing gets done in government, 650. <BOOING> I guess she'll say those 650, remember the 33? Well the 650,000 also, the wedding, and some yoga, right? <BOOING> Finally it is believed that no less than five foreign intelligence agencies successfully hacked into Clinton's illegal insecure server, which contained classified information, creating an ongoing security threat to the United States.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> Think of what happened to so many people for doing so little by comparison, think of it.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> Hillary Clinton has engaged in a massive, far-reaching criminal conduct, and equally far-reaching cover-up. She created an illegal e-mail server to shield and guard her activity, so simple, so simple. Shoulda happened a long time ago, folks. Now we're going through phase two, which sounds like it's even worse than phase one. Shoulda happened in phase one. But she was protected by the Department of Justice. <BOOING> She illegally transmitted confidential information, and then lied about it to Congress. She illegally destroyed federal records, including 33,000 e-mails, after receiving a congressional subpoena.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> And she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. <BOOING> Who in this room has gotten rid of a phone, and then smashed the hell out of it with a hammer, anybody? Raise your hand, please. Raise your hand. I see one hand over there. I see a hand there. What business are you in? I want to know. No, I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know. I don't wanna meet him. <BOOING> She engaged in corrupt pay for play at the State Department for personal enrichment, she lied to the FBI and she lied to the American people many, many times. <BOOING> Remember she lied 39 times, I don't recall, I don't recall. Well those are all lies, because she recalled every one of them. These are sad events for our country, a high-ranking government official has been caught selling her public office, threatening national security, and engaging in a massive criminal cover-up. If she were to win, it would create unprecedented constitutional crisis.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! >
<TRUMP:> Here we go again with Clinton, you remember the impeachment, and the problems? She's likely to be under investigation for many, many years, also likely to conclude in a criminal trial. This is not what we need in this country, folks. We need somebody that's going to go to work to bring our jobs back, to take care of our military, to strengthen up our borders. <APPLAUSE> This is not what we need, it's going to be a mess. And they say it, they say it. This is going to be a mess for many years to come before they figure it all out. We don't need that. We need a president that's gonna go in and do their job. <APPLAUSE> And I just left, by the way, Miami. And in leaving, I see Air Force One. So I said to myself I wonder who that could be. <APPLAUSE> And it's our president. <BOOING> And he's down here campaigning for crooked Hillary. <BOOING> Now why, why isn't he back in the office, sometimes referred to as the Oval Office? Why isn't he back in the White House bringing our jobs back?
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> And helping our veterans?
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> Right? Why, why isn't he back working? He's campaigning every day, and I actually think considering that she is under criminal investigation, I think he's actually got a conflict. <APPLAUSE> And one of the things it taught us, Wikileaks, he knew she had a lot of wrong things going on, you know that. That also came out, Obama knew what was going on by the way, just in case you didn't know, he knew. This guy oughta be back in the office working, he's not gonna be there very long, thank goodness. But he oughta be back in the office working. <APPLAUSE> We don't win anymore as a country, we don't win with our military, we don't win on trade. This guy oughta get back to the office and stop campaigning. <APPLAUSE> If we win on November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by, and for the people. <APPLAUSE> Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive, double-digit premium hike. Who's got their number yet? Does anybody know? <BOOING> Should I tell you? Do you want me to depress everybody? You just put your head down, start crying, and leave. I won't tell you. I don't want to tell you. You know why? Because if I do, you'll be so depressed, I don't like people leaving a speech early, crying. <BOOING> You're not going to like it, folks. In the great state of Arizona though, as an example, premiums are going up more than 116 percent, and it doesn't work. Obamacare doesn't work. I'm repealing it, we're gonna replace it with something so much better, and so much cheaper. <APPLAUSE> Hillary's going to double up. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year, think of it. Good luck in that negotiation. In Minnesota where the premium entries will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Oh, did he take heat, him and Bill Clinton. Did Bill Clinton take heat? He said it's crazy, Obamacare, he said it's crazy. They lied to us. The president lied to us 28 times. He said you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, remember, he kept lying and lying and lying. <BOOING> Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are leaving, and deductibles are through the roof, sometimes $15,000. In other words you have to spend $15,000 before you start using it. Obamacare is a total catastrophe, yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, she doesn't want to terminate it, she doesn't want to get rid of it. She wants to double down, making it much more expensive than it is right now, and it's right now ridiculous. <BOOING> It's your number one cost right now, bigger than your mortgage, it's bigger than your rent. First time that's ever happened. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare, and save healthcare for every family in Florida and our country. <APPLAUSE> So important. Real change also means restoring honesty to government. Hillary was given the debate questions in advance by Donna Brazile, by the way. <BOOING> Can you imagine if those questions, because the dishonest media -- among the world's dishonest people by the way. <BOOING> It's not even a big story. Mainstream media hardly covers it. They hardly talk. Think about it, she got the debate questions against Bernie Sanders, probably got the ones against me too, but we won that debate very easily, those debates. <APPLAUSE> We won those debates. <APPLAUSE> I don't care if she got 'em. Except that it shows how dishonest. But think of this. Supposing I got the debate questions, it would be front page of the Washington Post. It would be front page of the New York Times. He must immediately withdraw from the race. What he did is disgraceful. I'll tell you what, they don't even write about it. So Donna Brazile was fired from CNN. <APPLAUSE> That's good. But why wasn't she fired from the DNC? Because what she did was totally dishonest. Did you see her on television the other night? She couldn't answer uh, well, where did he get 'em? Where did he get 'em? Where did you get 'em? She's going, that's the questioner was asking that. Where did you get those questions? Where did you get 'em? Well, uh, I got 'em, well, I got 'em -- I don't know where I got 'em. I tell you what, she should be fired, she should be fired, but much more importantly, Hillary Clinton should be fired. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> Because Donna Brazile couldn't answer the questions, she looked like a fool on television, but she couldn't answer the questions. But you know what was worse? She took the questions, and gave 'em to crooked Hillary. <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: That's cheating!>
<TRUMP:> That's cheating, and crooked Hillary instead of saying I'm sorry, I can't accept them, we have to report this incident, she took the questions, went in, and had good answers for Bernie. At some point doesn't Bernie Sanders get tired of it? They're calling him all these names, they're cheating on him. Doesn't he tell his supporters to go vote for Trump at some point, right? <APPLAUSE> And I haven't seen one story where Hillary Clinton -- they blame Donna Brazile a little bit, very little. But seriously, can you imagine if it was me that got those questions? <BOOING> You know what I've been saying, they would re-institute the electric chair, right? Front page news, front page news. She's a very dishonest person, probably the most dishonest person ever to run for the office of president, I really believe -- I believe that. <APPLAUSE> The Clintons are the sordid past, and someday they'll start writing about these dishonest people back there. Someday they will ask the question, and they will do a front page headline, why didn't Hillary Clinton report that she got the confidential guarded questions to a debate? And someday these dishonest people are going to write a story about it in mainstream media. <APPLAUSE> But we're the bright future. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption. <APPLAUSE> We understand that. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words we all have to say, we, all of us. It's a lot of us. There's a lot of us. This is a movement they've never seen this before in this country. That's why we don't want to blow it now, tell them, because you're allowed to vote early. But we don't want to blow it on November 8th, because this is a movement like they've never seen before, all of 'em, even the ones that dislike me, of which there are quite a few of those people, but all of 'em. This is a movement like they've never seen in the country.
<AUDIENCE: We love you!>
<TRUMP:> But it will end quickly. It will end quickly if we don't go out to vote on November 8th. So let's not let it end, let's keep it, because we're going to make America great again, folks. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make America great again. <APPLAUSE> When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington D.C., and we are going to drain?
<AUDIENCE: Drain!>
<TRUMP:> The?
<AUDIENCE: The!>
<TRUMP:> Swamp!
<AUDIENCE: Swamp! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Right. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs, they've been stolen. <BOOING> Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by his lovely wife, Hillary. <BOOING> America has lost 70,000, listen to that number, I thought it was a typo, for weeks I've been saying it, 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed deal. We're going to get 'em back, folks, don't worry. <APPLAUSE> We're living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world, it's what it is, greatest -- think of it, greatest job theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving the state of Florida, I can tell you, quickly, very quickly. <APPLAUSE> The theft of American prosperity will end. And we don't mind that it's 115 degrees in this room, right? Do we mind? <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: We love you! We love you!>
<TRUMP:> It is hot in this room, but you know what, that's OK. We lose a couple of pounds, not the worst thing in the world, right? From now on it's going to be America first. <APPLAUSE> A Trump administration will negotiate NAFTA, and we will stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and all unfair subsidy behavior, which is a lot. <APPLAUSE> We will also immediately stop the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, a disaster, another disastrous potential deal. <APPLAUSE> As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> We will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations, billions and billions of dollars. <APPLAUSE> And use that money to support America's environmental and national infrastructure. <APPLAUSE> By the way, folks, we're sending billions and billions of dollars, we're making our companies non-competitive, other companies are -- throughout the world are killing us, and other countries don't adhere to whatever they're supposed to do. But we're sending all of this money. Here's what we want. We want crystal clean water. <APPLAUSE> We want immaculately clean air. <APPLAUSE> And we want great safety. <APPLAUSE> Above that, folks, let's go to town, and let's employ a lot of people. <APPLAUSE> We're going to spend a lot of money on our infrastructure, including the deepening which you need, of the harbor at Jackport <ph>. Do we all know Jackport <ph>? <APPLAUSE> We will become a rich nation once again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. <APPLAUSE> In Chicago, 3,715 people have been shot since January 1st. Think of that, think of that, almost 4,000 people. 4,000 people have been shot since January 1st.
<AUDIENCE: Where's Obama?>
<TRUMP:> Nationwide murders have experienced their largest single- year increase in 45 years. Now the press doesn't tell you that, because the press is guarding Hillary Clinton, and the press doesn't want them, and doesn't want you to know the real facts about your jobs, about all of the things -- about our military, which is now bogged down in Mosul. Remember I said why can't we ever like go in there quietly, secretly, and do the job, right? <APPLAUSE> Remember I said the element of surprise, and they came, oh, what does Trump know about -- I know plenty, believe me. They're bogged down, it's a tough situation. Four months ago, we're going into Mosul. I kept saying every time I turn the television off, I say oh, why do they have to say it? We're going to get the leaders of ISIS. We're going -- and it's four months. We're going in, because we believe the leaders of ISIS are in Mosul. Four months -- three months ago. We are going into Mosul, we're gonna get those leaders. Problem is, after we said it the first time, within about 12 minutes they were gone. <APPLAUSE> We are led by stupid people, remember that, stupid people. <APPLAUSE> Stupid people. <APPLAUSE> Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't talk? We did the job, and you had the news conference a week later, wouldn't that be nice? <APPLAUSE> To announce good results? These are not good results. A Trump administration will work with local and federal law enforcement to end this growing crime wave, it's very substantial. Every child in America has the right to grow up in safety and in peace. <APPLAUSE> We will also keep you safe from terrorism. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming in to the country. <BOOING> They'll be pouring into the country. That's above Obama's unbelievable thousands and thousands coming in. Her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading across our schools and your communities. And that's one of the reasons we have all those Women for Trump signs, OK? Believe me. <APPLAUSE> The women don't want this. And by the way, I have to tell you, I think I have tremendous support from women, tremendous, very tremendous. <APPLAUSE> Look, we have tremendous support. <APPLAUSE> We're going to keep our country safe. You know, they say well what will you do for women? I say start off with we're going to keep our country safe, is that good? Is that a good starter? <APPLAUSE> I think we're going to do tremendously with women. We're doing tremendously with African-Americans, you see that. You see what's going on, you see it. <APPLAUSE> You see what's going on. They're very -- you know these characters in the back, they're very discouraged because all these lines, people with hats on saying Make America Great, buttons, shirts. <APPLAUSE> But big reports about tremendous support from groups that I was not supposed to have as much support from. It's throwing -- it's throwing them a little bit off balance, they're not happy. They're not happy. The protected one is not being very well protected. <APPLAUSE> When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program, and we will keep -- <APPLAUSE> We will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country, OK? Believe me, we'll keep 'em out. <APPLAUSE> And we'll build safe havens, and we'll do things over in Syria, we'll get other countries to pay for it. We have $20 trillion in debt, but we'll get the Gulf states, they have a lot of money, they got a tremendous money, they'll pay for it, I promise. <APPLAUSE> Because we have to take care of people, but honestly, we have enough -- hey folks, we have enough problems in this country. Look at what's happening to Germany, look at what's happening to France, look at Paris. <BOOING> I have a friend, every year he goes to Paris, I haven't seen him in a while. Paris, oh, the city of lights, he used to tell me. For years, Paris, Paris. I see him like a month ago, how was Paris this summer? Oh, I don't go to Paris, you kidding me? <LAUGHTER> It's no longer Paris. He hasn't been there in a long time. We're gonna have our country be great again, folks, OK? We're gonna to have smartness <ph>. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna do it -- we're gonna do it properly. We're gonna do it properly. We're gonna -- we're gonna do it through love, we're gonna do it in a lot of different ways, but we're gonna have our country be great. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. <APPLAUSE> And yes, we will build a great wall. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build a wall! Build a wall! Build a wall!>
<TRUMP:> And Mexico, which is making a fortune with us, just a fortune, at the border, and through trade deficits, our trade deficit with Mexico is enormous, just in case you -- well, it's enormous with everybody, why should they be any different in all fair -- Mexico will pay for the wall, OK, believe me, they will pay for the wall. <APPLAUSE> 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> They might not know it yet, but they're paying for the wall. We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers. <APPLAUSE> They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been, it's a national emergency. The immigration officers warned in a letter that Hillary Clinton's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history, and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, that's what they wrote us. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton allowed many, many people, the most dangerous and violent criminals in the world, to go free, because their home countries very intelligently wouldn't accept them back. So we take a killer, a drug lord, a vicious gang member, bring them back to their countries, and they'd say turn that plane around and get 'em out of there. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary Clinton's State Department would say oh, well that's too bad, oh, well we'll accept 'em. And they go in our streets, and they kill people. <BOOING>. Hillary Clinton supports -- and I guarantee you one thing --
<AUDIENCE: (Inaudible) Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> In four years or eight years, I guarantee you one thing, there won't be one instance, not one, where one of these murderers or drug people, or gang members, not one instance, folks, where that plane will come back with that person on that plane, I guarantee you that, there won't be one instance. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton supports totally open borders, there goes your country, and strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who was deported at least five times. <BOOING> And we're putting very, very strong language in, it's going to be submitted the first day I'm in office. When they come in once, we deport 'em. When they come in twice, they go to jail for five years. <APPLAUSE> When they come in another one, it'll be 10 years. And you know what's gonna happen, sort of pretty simple. They here, they get caught again, they go to jail for five years, just what's gonna happen? They're not coming back, folks. <APPLAUSE> Now our people don't want to do it, our weak, weak politicians don't wanna do that. A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. <APPLAUSE> We will end illegal immigration, we are going to stop drugs from pouring into your communities and poisoning our youth and everybody else.
<AUDIENCE: No drugs! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> And we will deport all criminal aliens quickly from our country. We will also repeal the Obama Clinton defense sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna rebuild it. <APPLAUSE> Our navy is the smallest it has -- have you heard this? I mean to me, this is sad. And then you wonder why China, who's making a fortune with us, they make our product, they take our money, and they're fine, I have a great relationship, I've made a fortune with China, I had the biggest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in New York, China, biggest bank in the world from China. But you know what? You know what? They're building right now a tremendous fortress in the South China Sea. They're not supposed to be doing it, but they're doing it because they have no respect for Obama, they laugh at Hillary, they think -- they think Hillary's a joke, she's a joke. <APPLAUSE> She is a joke. You know what? They dream, they dream, they go to sleep at night, these tough leaders, you know, they're tough, and smart, they're smart, and really tough. They go to dream at night, they go to sleep, and they dream that Hillary Clinton becomes president, that's what their dream is. <BOOING> I've made a lot of money with China, I'm not sure they like the idea of me, I'll be honest, but that's OK. And we'll get along great with China, we'll get along with China better now. I guarantee, they won't be building forts in the middle of the sea, totally against everything. You know, they're so -- what they're doing is such a big violation, but they have no respect for Obama, and they no longer respect our country. Our navy is the smallest it has been since World War I. We will build the 350 ship navy that our country needs, and desires, and must have. <APPLAUSE> That means brand new state-of-the-art ships in places like Mayport, right here in Jacksonville. <APPLAUSE> I'm honored, and this is a great honor for me, to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 medal of honor recipients. <APPLAUSE> I'm also honored to have the greatest temperament that anybody has, because we know how to win. <APPLAUSE> She spends $1 billion, she spends so much money, I see these ads, people that know me they say how can they say that? Now we have -- you know what, we have a temperament because -- we have a certain temperament. It's a temperament of knowing how to win. <APPLAUSE> It's knowing how to win. The leaders of our country, boy, you talk about temperament, and interestingly, whether it's Podesta or Bernie Sanders, Podesta said Hillary has bad instincts, and I'll be honest, I've read the things that he has said about Hillary on the Wikileaks. <APPLAUSE> And if I were Hillary, I would fire Podesta so fast. He says such demeaning things about her, she's got bad instincts, I mean you've read some of the things, it's incredible, you know, how do you have people working for you and then you have to deal with them? And it was all behind her back, he must be a bad guy, I don't know, but to say the things he said about her, she should look at him, say Podesta, you're fired. <APPLAUSE> But she can't do that, she probably needs him as a witness in the criminal case, so she can't do it. <APPLAUSE> Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya. She empowered Iran, and she unleashed ISIS. You know, she wants to get rid of ISIS, she's the one that started it, it came through the vacuum. Now it's in 32 countries. And I watched her during the debate, meekly talk about ISIS. And I said to her you've been here for 30 years, Hillary. You started ISIS. You were secretary of state when it started. Why are you going to get rid of it? You can't get rid of anything. You don't know what you're doing. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear armed Russia, that could very well lead to World War III, and remember, Putin has no respect for her either, has no respect for her.
<AUDIENCE: No one does!>
<TRUMP:> Doesn't like her, doesn't respect her, doesn't respect Obama, and doesn't like him. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, wars we never win, and now it's in worse shape than ever before, wars we never win, folks. They've dragged us in to foreign wars that have made us lessly <ph>, and they took us, they opened up our borders. You know, it's interesting, we fight for their borders, but at home we have open borders. Try and figure that one out. We fight like hell for their borders, we spend trillions of dollars to do it, but at home we have open borders. <BOOING> And they've shipped our jobs on top of everything, and our wealth, to other countries. That's gotta end very quickly. <APPLAUSE> Our jobs are coming back, and our companies aren't leaving. And if our companies wanna leave, there are consequences. If they wanna go to Mexico or some other country, or build a plant and make air conditioners like Carrier is doing, or build cars like Ford is doing, Ford is moving an entire mess of division down, all small car production. They wanna do that, you tell them very nicely, I'm sorry. You know, I always joke that I wanna make those calls so badly. I don't want to put anybody in charge of those calls, they're so easy. <LAUGHTER> And they're short. And our politicians should have done this for years. But you tell them that when you make your air conditioner or your car, whatever it might be, you build in Mexico, enjoy the weather. When that car or that product comes through our very strong border, now it will be a very strong border, there will be a 35 percent tax. <APPLAUSE> And you know what's going to happen? Nobody's going to leave, folks. Now the politicians know this, but they're all taken care of by those special interest groups that want that to happen. But there will be a 35 percent tax, and nobody's leaving. And the ones that do leave, that's OK too, we'll make a lot of money. But nobody says it. Does anybody say it like Trump, right?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> So simple. To all Americans, I say it's time for new leadership. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan, and Hillary is raising taxes very substantially. She's raising your taxes. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We will cancel every illegal Obama executive order. <APPLAUSE> We're going to rebuild our military, and take care of our great, great, great veterans. <APPLAUSE> They've never been taken care of properly, 22 suicides a day, not gonna happen. We're gonna take care of our veterans. And I appreciate all the support I get from the military. There's a big article today on the front page of the New York Times, and they say why does Trump have support from the military? And by the way, and law enforcement. And by military I mean including big leagues, our -- our veterans, you know? How many veterans are here right now? <APPLAUSE> A lot. <APPLAUSE> Yeah, a big, big story, the veterans, the military, and law enforcement. We're going to provide school choice and we're going to put an end to common core, we're going to bring our education <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> We are going to support the great men and women of law enforcement, we're going to support 'em. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna save our Second Amendment which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> Great people, you know, we have the endorsement of the NRA, it's great, these are great people. <APPLAUSE> The earliest they've ever given. And we will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, so important, so important. <APPLAUSE> It is time to cut our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past.
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing. <APPLAUSE> Just words and just made things worse.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> She is the candidate of yesterday. It's going to be really interesting to see what happens to her. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> I wonder. So let me ask you, let me ask you, she shouldn't be allowed to run based on the e-mail scandals and all them, OK. <APPLAUSE> So let me ask you this questions. I've never done this before. Will justice be done or not? Will justice be done, yes or no? <APPLAUSE> Hard, right? I don't know. I don't know, I'm not sure anybody knows the answer.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> They're protecting her and it's very -- we are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. <APPLAUSE> We're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters of which there are many. <APPLAUSE> We are fighting for every American who believes in truth and justice, not money and power. I'll tell you, we are going to rule the day, this group, we are going to rule the day. This group, and many, many, many like you. Every place we go, every place we go, the love of this country is incredible.
<AUDIENCE: We love you!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors, and not the special interests. We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future. With your vote, we are just, can you believe this, five days away from the chance you've been waiting for your entire life. <APPLAUSE> Five days away. <APPLAUSE> Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-03"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. These are wild times. <APPLAUSE> These are wild times. Wow, what a beautiful building, and place, and all these people. But honestly we always have a lot of people. They just want to see this country do the right thing again, you know that. We're going to do the right thing. <APPLAUSE> We're going to be a smart country again, very soon. I want to begin by thanking my amazing wife, Melania. I don't know if anybody saw her today. She got up and gave an incredible speech and she -- she did a great job. That takes -- takes a lot of courage, takes a lot of courage. In five days we're going to win the great state of North Carolina and we are going to win back the White House. <APPLAUSE> Great state, great people. And the polls have been amazing. One just came out, the Rasmussen poll. We're three points up nationwide. <APPLAUSE> We're leading in Ohio, we're leading in Iowa, we're leading in Florida, we're leading in North Carolina, which is... <APPLAUSE> We're leading -- just came out two minutes ago, two polls, we're leading in New Hampshire. <APPLAUSE> We're sort of leading all over the place, it's a great honor -- it's a great honor, honestly. And this is not an easy thing to do, you know that. But we had to do it. You have to do it. We have to do it. We're all doing it together. So, I just want to thank you. It's like we have no choice, we have no choice. <APPLAUSE> Well, hopefully, you voted or you're going to vote early, but you're going to vote. But, remember, November 8th, so important. And you get out there early, if you can. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare, you know that. <APPLAUSE> It's just been announced that the residents of North Carolina are going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike. <BOOING> In the great state of Arizona -- where I just left -- premiums are going up 116 percent, they're not happy. Ninety-five of 100 North Carolina counties will only have one insurer in the Obamacare exchange next year, which is a catastrophe, frankly. Lots of luck in that negotiation, by the way, folks. Don't worry about it, it'll be dead. We'll kill it and we're going to start all over again with a great one. <APPLAUSE> You'll be spending a lot less money for much, much better health care, much, much less money. In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor said, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting, and deductibles are through the roof. You know, some people have 15, $16,000 deductible. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. <BOOING> It'll be much more expensive.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> Did you ever see anything like what's going on right now? If we don't get rid of Obamacare, it will destroy health care in North Carolina and all over the United States, it will be the end. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in North Carolina, and frankly in the United States. <APPLAUSE> Real change also means restoring honesty to government. Where we have a problem with Hillary. <inaudible> There is important breaking news from last night. It was reported that the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's pay-for-play... <APPLAUSE> ... corruption at the State Department. This is in addition to the FBI's criminal investigation into her e-mails. <inaudible> 650,000 e-mails. They say the Federal Bureau, that it's likely to yield a very, very serious charge or an indictment. I'm just saying that's what the newspapers are saying. <APPLAUSE> That's what the reports say. However, it was also reported that the political leadership at the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> Telling FBI agents to stand down, and is interfering in the FBI's criminal investigation. <BOOING> Perhaps that's what happened the first time. I would imagine that's what's happened. Further, it's believed that no less than five foreign intelligence agencies successfully hacked into Hillary's illegal insecure server. In other words, Hillary's corrupt criminal scheme put the safety of every American family in danger, that's what's happened. Hillary Clinton is engaged in far-reaching criminal conduct and in an equally far-reaching criminal cover up, including the destruction of 33,000 e-mails, after receiving -- after -- after, can you imagine? Can you imagine if I did that? They would say, he must immediately leave this race. Oh, boy. Thirty-three thousand e-mails were deleted after receiving a Congressional subpoena. That alone, folks -- that's not the new group; that's the old group. That alone is big problems, for which she got away with murder. Honestly, she has no right to be running, you know that. No right. <APPLAUSE> But now she's got bigger problems. If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented Constitutional crisis that would cripple the operations of our government. She is likely to be under investigation for many years, and also it will probably end up -- in my opinion -- in a criminal trial. I mean, you take a look. Who knows? But it certainly looks that way, certainly being spoken of. Americans deserve a government that can work and really has to work for them from day one, we'll do that. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption. <APPLAUSE> The plan includes a Constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. <APPLAUSE> It also includes a lifetime ban on government officials becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. I'd say that makes senses. <APPLAUSE> That sort of makes sense, right? I think so. Makes sense? I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words we -- we, as a group -- all say right now, when we win on November 8th, we're going to Washington, and we are going to drain the swamp. <APPLAUSE> We're going to drain the swamp. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs that have been taken away. <APPLAUSE> They've been taken away. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary. <BOOING> The worst trade deal ever signed in the history of the world, believe me. America has lost -- I never believe number when I give it -- but America's lost 70,000 factories -- 70,000. You wouldn't think it's possible. Seventy thousand factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, we are. Nobody has every lost jobs like we do. Defective contracts, negotiated by political hacks. We have the greatest business people, greatest negotiators in the world in this country, we don't use them. We use political hacks that gave a contribution or a campaign contribution. They end up getting jobs. This is who's dealing with China, with -- how about Iran? How about the new Iran deal done by.... <BOOING> Started by -- started by Hillary Clinton, and finished off by our great bicyclist, our great bicycle racer. <LAUGHTER> He's in a bicycle race. He breaks his leg in the middle of the negotiation. I promise you, I will never enter a bicycle race. I promise. I swear, I swear. <APPLAUSE> I now have nearly -- and think of this one, 'cause I can't even believe it -- we have an 800 -- almost -- $800 billion a year annual trade deficit with the world. OK? Eight hundred billion. Who's negotiating these deals? Who's -- who's negotiating these deals? Don't worry, it'll change -- it'll change. We've got Carl Icahn, we've got the greatest negotiators in the world, it'll change so fast. And these guys -- I have some of the best business leaders in the world. They do it for sport, they don't want money, they -- they'll do it for sport. <APPLAUSE> The same special interests who shipped the jobs out of America are the people who've given hundreds of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> Now, I just got back from Florida. I was begging for like a regular commercial, Ivory Snow, Heinz ketchup, every commercial was a hit on Trump, hit, hit, hit. And almost all of them were untrue. Some were pretty good, actually. But the most negative -- it's horrible, and really I mean so much fabrication. When you see the rusted out factories and empty buildings here, just remember Hillary Clinton's policies and the policies of her people did this to you. Just look at the devastation. Pillowtex laid off 1,125 people, and took their jobs to Mexico and other countries. Freightliner, one of your companies, laid off 500 people in Mount Holly, and moved their jobs to Mexico. You know, Mexico, I was there three months ago. I met with the President of Mexico, nice guy, really good. We'll have a great relationship. But Mexico's like a one-way street. It's a one -- they take the money, the jobs, the factories. You know, we get drugs and unemployment is what we get. Flextronics... <BOOING>
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!>
<TRUMP:> All right. It's a little early in this speech, but I promise, we will build the wall, believe me. <APPLAUSE> Little early. I wasn't up to that part but, you know what, I won't be able to shut you up unless I say that, right? We will build the wall and what? Mexico will pay for the wall. <APPLAUSE> Flextronics laid off 312 workers in Charlotte and moved their jobs to Mexico and China and various other countries. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, there will be consequences. <APPLAUSE> And we will stop the jobs, because you people have been affected much more than most, from leaving North Carolina. And I have great successful place in North Carolina, in Charlotte, right outside of Charlotte. Right? Trump National, it's great. Lot of employees, I pay them a fortune, they're very happy. They do an unbelievable job. It's a real success. Look at this -- look at this. My members, I have members, I have -- good. Do I do a good job? Do I do a good job? <APPLAUSE> Wow, that's fantastic, thank you. That's so nice. I didn't know that. Sort of interesting. I bought it for very little. I didn't, you know, I just -- I bought it out of a bankruptcy, it's this gorgeous job. They did a good job, but they -- they got caught. And I fixed it, ii spent a lot of money on it, right? I fixed it, and now it's so successful and everybody loves it. She said, on schedule, under budget. <APPLAUSE> It's true, it's true. Thank you. She's right about that. That's good. Well, it's great to have you here. Thank you very much. You know, it's a great success, and it's just a great state. You know, it's very interesting, so I have a lot of workers, they're all over the country. And when I buy things -- though I don't think I'm going to doing this too much longer, I'm going to be running something else much more important. <APPLAUSE> But these workers, they travel. They're all over and they travel to different place, even to different countries. They're great, they're crews. And they'll come in, and they came to North Carolina. And I said, how'd you do, Felix <ph>? How'd you do, Leo <ph>? How are you? How's it going? They said, Mr. Trump, when we retire, we want to come to North Carolina. They loved it, it's funny, they never said that. <APPLAUSE> They've been to so many different places. So there's something about North Carolina that's special, and that area, that is so good. So we love it. The theft of American prosperity will end on November 8th, believe me. From now on it's going to be America first. If a company wants to fire their workers in North Carolina or in this country, move to another country, and try to ship their product back into the United States, we will apply a 35 percent tax to those <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> And you know what's going to happen, right? They're not leaving. They won't leave. When that happens, they will not leave. And if they do, that's OK too, 'cause we're going to make a fortune, all right? Although their formula won't work -- their formula won't work. It's so simple to do, it's so simple to stop. And these people haven't wanted to do it. A lot of reasons. Number one, in some cases they're not smart. But in other cases, they're getting so much money from the special interests and the donors that want it to happen because they may own the company, et cetera, et cetera, that they're not looking for the best interest of our company. And you know what, I'm going to have over $100 million in this campaign. I don't care about these people. You know, the special interests? I used to be the ultimate special interest. I mean in all fairness, I know the other side very well. I also love our country, and our country was going bad. It was going bad. No more deals with Iran where we give them $150 billion back. <BOOING> Where we give them $1.7 billion in cash. How about that one? You know what that would be? That's like you fill it up to the ceiling. I tell you what, it's hard to believe, so -- so we did this and we're happy we did it. And we've created a movement, remember this, like nobody has ever seen in this country before, ever. Newt Gingrich was on and he was talking, well, if you go back 150 years, there was a movement. You know, I'm saying, 150 years. But it's -- it's been a great honor, I have to tell you. It's been a great honor and a great pleasure, and I've gotten to know the people of this country, and they are unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> They're unbelievable, right? They're unbelievable people. And we're going to -- and I say it every once in a while, we're going to have Apple and other great companies start making their product in the United States. OK? <APPLAUSE> We're going to do it. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and, if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers, much better. And by the way, just to set the record straight because the crooked media -- you talk about dishonest people, these are the world's most dishonest people. I believe in free trade -- they have a very low rating right now, folks. Hopefully, I've helped in that. You could have done the greatest thing in the world, it's like this total thing -- I'm looking forward tomorrow to read those newspapers, or I'm looking forward to seeing it on television. Something you do really, really well. And then you see it and they say, man, that was bad. Boy, they made that look bad, you know. They are bad people, I'll tell you that. <BOOING> And they try so hard, they try so hard to protect Hillary Clinton. And you know what? I think the gig is up. I don't think it's working any more, don't think it's working. <APPLAUSE> No, it's not working too good. We will also immediately stop the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's going to take the rest of your companies out. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> We're the highest taxed nation in the world. And we're going to massively cut taxes for the middle class. Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes. How can you do it? We're the highest taxed nation in the world. She wants to raise taxes. Not going to happen, folks. We're going to create something that's so beautiful. The biggest since Ronald Reagan -- biggest tax decrease. We will also unleash American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, and clean coal. We're going to put our miners back to work, and we're going to put our steel workers back to work. Our plan will end the EPA, which is a -- hey, look, it's all wonderful, but it's a disaster. EPA intrusion into your family farms and stop the double taxation of family farms at death. You can't even pass them down to your children. You can't pass small businesses down to your children. Very importantly, we will also work to rebuild from the damage, in your great state, caused by Hurricane Matthew, that was a rough one. We will take care of our people. We're going to take care of the people of the United States. We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. <BOOING> Not going to happen. Her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected President, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. <APPLAUSE> And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> Sorry, we have no choice. We have no choice. Right? <APPLAUSE> A Trump administration...
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Great people. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. <APPLAUSE> Be nice, right? Be nice. It would be nice to have borders, don't you think, right? And we will build the wall, as I -- we will build it. <APPLAUSE> It'll be a great wall. And the harder they fight, the taller it gets, OK? I give you that, I'm telling you. The harder they fight, the tougher it gets. You know, they tried to build a wall in like '06. You know that. And Hillary Clinton was in favor of it. And they couldn't get -- you won't even believe this story -- they couldn't get their environmental impact statement approved. Did you know that? So here you have China in the South China Sea, building one of the great, one of the biggest fortresses anywhere in the world, ripping the hell out of the sea. Excavators, they say the biggest ever used, ripping the sea. They conceived of the idea -- listen to that. You OK back there? No, no, they conceived of the idea, let's say on a Monday night, they started construction on Tuesday morning, right? Now they shouldn't be doing it, they're not supposed to be doing it. It against everything we sort of have with them. But they -- boy, this is a great group <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> Say, whoa. <APPLAUSE> But China has no respect for us, and Russia has no respect for us, and certainly no respect. Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton. He dreams -- he dreams of her becoming president. You know who else dreams of Hillary Clinton? ISIS. Because ISIS formed while she was secretary of State in the vacuum that they left. We should have never been in Iraq, but we should have never gotten out the way we got out. And that's -- that was the birth of ISIS, now they're in 32 countries. And I watched her during debates, the debates -- did you see she had the debate questions to the other debate. Right? <BOOING> How about if Donald Trump had the debate questions? Right? The electric chair, right? Headlines, Trump to leave race. We demand Trump get out now. They had Donna Brazile... <BOOING> She cheated. Did you see her on television? She was unable to speak. Where did you get those questions? But she cheated, and they fired her from CNN, which they should have. But why aren't they firing her from the DNC? She cheated. Now, but -- but I have a much bigger question, 'cause forget Donna Brazile. She gave the questions to crooked Hillary Clinton, right? So -- and this is two or three times, don't forget, they caught them like twice. So they gave the questions, she gave them to crooked Hillary. Why didn't Hillary Clinton report it? Why didn't Hillary Clinton go to some ethics group? <BOOING> Why? You know why? Do you know why? Do you know why? I know the answer. You want to hear the answer? Because she's crooked Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> Right, very simple. Very simple. Crooked Hillary.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> And then she does these phony commercials about me, this and that, give me a break crooked Hillary. We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol office. First time they've ever endorsed a presidency. <APPLAUSE> They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been, and I can see that. Although a lot of people are probably flowing in because they think I'm going to win, so they say, we better get this done right now. The immigration officers warned in a letter that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in United States history. And that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives, I see that. It's the most radical immigration plan in history. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed many, many of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries, very intelligently, would not take then back. They didn't want killers, they didn't want drug lords, they didn't want gang members. So we fly them into their country, and their country says turn that plane around -- or whatever they're taking them in. Get out of here, we don't want them, can't blame them. But I promise you that never once -- whether it's four years or eight years -- never once -- never once will we come back with somebody in that plane or whatever it may be. When those people get out, they're getting out. <APPLAUSE> And they've hurt a lot of people. Hillary wants totally open borders, there goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco... <BOOING> ... where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant, who had been deported probably more than five times. In nearby Landis, North Carolina, 20-year-old, Leanna Newman and her unborn child were killed by an illegal immigrant drunk driver with two prior deportations. Leanna's killer had two pair of DUI convictions, three convictions for driving with a revoked license, a conviction for assault, and numerous other charges. And people that knew him said, please incarcerate him. A Trump administration will impose tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for deported illegal immigrants. <APPLAUSE> Very tough requirements, minimum sentences for deported illegal immigrants who come back into our country. Now, if they come back in and we tell them you're out, good luck, don't come back, but if you come back, it's five years. Then if they come back a second time, it's 10 years. And then a third time, it's 15 years. Guess what's going to happen? They're not coming back, right? They're not coming back. <APPLAUSE> Sort of simple. It's amazing what common sense can do, isn't it? We will also cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. <APPLAUSE> And this crime wave, it's a tremendous crime wave, will come to an end. We will repeal Obama-Clinton defense sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military, which we need so much. <APPLAUSE> Greatest people on Earth in our military. North Carolina will be a major part of this effort, with new advanced flying beautiful planes. Isn't it nice to have nice, new planes? From Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, anybody know it? Yes. <APPLAUSE> Marine battalions at Camp Lejeune -- I've been to Camp Lejeune. <APPLAUSE> And more troops and resources we will supply for Fort Bragg. <APPLAUSE> I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. So we have many more coming. <APPLAUSE> They're not thrilled with Hillary, that I can tell you. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya, she empowered Iran, and she unleashed ISIS with the vacuum -- through the vacuum, they came. Remember, Obama called them the junior varsity? Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria, in conflict with a nuclear armed Russia, that could trigger World War III. She always talks about me. See what I have is a winning temperament, I have a winning temperament. <APPLAUSE> Hillary is an unstable person. She is an -- I think she's probably spent $500 million on phony ads. The best thing I have is my temperament. We know how to win -- we know how to win. <APPLAUSE> You got to know why you want to win too, she has no idea. And she doesn't win. We don't win any more as a country. We don't win at trade, we don't win with our military -- we can't beat ISIS -- we can't beat ISIS. ISIS will be defeated quickly, you watch. <APPLAUSE> And when we go in an attack a Mosul, if we have to do it -- which we shouldn't because if we got out the right way, we already had Mosul. And I've been complaining for four months, from the time I heard it. We will be attacking Mosul in four months. I said, no, don't tell me that, maybe they're not meaning it. The element of surprise, folks. And you see how tough it is now. We're going to be attacking Mosul because we think ISIL leaders are in Mosul, and if we attack them, we will capture those leaders. It's four months, right? Go. I said, why are they saying this? These leaders -- I mean, look, let's face it, they're pretty smart people, right? So I said, why are they saying this? Whatever happened to the element of surprise? Why are they saying this? And then three months go, and then two months -- and then I hear, in two months, now it's one month. And finally about a week, two weeks ago, I heard next week at about 3:15 we're going to start the attack. <LAUGHTER> These people are stupid, they're stupid people. <APPLAUSE> And it's turning out to be tough -- it's turning out to be tough because they're tough as hell, and they're prepared. They're using human shields, can you imagine this? This is like not since medieval times. Chopping off heads, drowning people in steel cages. We have to do it. Killing Christians, if you're Christian, forget it. Killing everybody. But why aren't we fighting the right way? Why aren't we fighting to win? Why aren't we -- why aren't we doing things right? Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we don't win. And now it's our worst nightmare. We've spent $6 trillion, we could have built our country twice -- we could have rebuilt our infrastructure, our country, twice. And forget about the $6 trillion, the lives that have been lost. The tremendous number of lives. Is there a doctor in the house, please? A doctor? OK. Yes, take your time, please. Thank you, thank you. These are great people. Some of these people have been here for seven hours. OK, keep that fan going. That's good. That's good, darling. You just take -- take it easy, take it easy. She looks great. She's going to be good. Do we have a doctor, please? Come on, let's go. Come on, fellas, let's go. Get a doctor. OK? There we go, there we go. She's our greatest. <APPLAUSE> Been here for seven hours that girl. <APPLAUSE> You take it easy, honey. Just take it easy and come back as soon as you feel good. OK? We're saving your place, and if they don't let you in, I'll get down there myself. <APPLAUSE> OK.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> OK? Thank you very much, fellas. Thank you, doctor. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open, isn't it amazing? We fight for their borders. We want borders, we fight for their borders, but our borders we leave open. Explain it. And they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries, our politicians. To all Americans I say it is time immediately for new leadership. <APPLAUSE> So, in concluding, just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. <APPLAUSE> We're going to eliminate every single -- every unnecessary job- killing regulation. The businesses, you're -- they're putting them out of business. And Hillary's going for big, big tax increases, folks. Enjoy them. We're going to cancel every illegal Obama executive order. <APPLAUSE> We're going to rebuild our very depleted military with the greatest people on Earth working in our military. <APPLAUSE> And speaking of great people, we are going to finally take proper care of our veterans, OK? <APPLAUSE> It's about time, about time. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have school choice, and we're going to put an end to Common Core once and for all. We're bringing our education... <APPLAUSE> We will support the men and women of law enforcement -- these are great people... <APPLAUSE> ... save our Second Amendment, which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> ... and appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> It's time to cut our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past. Hillary Clinton is the candidate of yesterday. Hey, can we take another four years of Obama?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> I don't think so -- I don't think so. Remember three weeks ago? They had 800 people that they were going to deport. Rough ones -- these were rough ones, these were rough ones. They were all set, and somebody made a mistake. Congratulations, they became citizens of the United States of America. <BOOING> But that wasn't the only mistake. Because of 800, it became 1,800 people. And I said that, he said, send them back. I said, OK, reverse your error, they say, we can't do that, it's against the Constitution. I said, really? These people -- these people. We are the movement of the future. We're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters, and they're all over the place. You see that on the line. <APPLAUSE> November 8th, you gotta get and vote. November 8th, November 8th. You can send in some of those little things, but November 8th you got to be there. Who's going to be there on November 8th? <APPLAUSE> Who's already voted in some form? <APPLAUSE> All right, get out there. No matter how you feel. If you are so sick, if your doctor gives you the worst prognosis, says, Jimmy or Jane, I'm sorry to tell you, but you won't be around for two more weeks. Doesn't make a damn bit of difference, you get out of bed and you vote. <APPLAUSE> We're going to be around -- we're all going to be around a long time, right? We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors, and not the special interests. <APPLAUSE> We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future for their children, for their family. With your vote, we are just -- this is so hard to believe -- five days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. <APPLAUSE> You're going to remember this vote on November, right? You're going to remember this vote -- thank you. AUDIENCE; Trump! Trump! Trump!
<TRUMP:> Thank you. You're going to remember this vote because November 8th we're going to start when -- even the psychology's going to change, even though we're not going to be there until January -- middle of January -- the whole psychology is going to change. Our country is going to start winning again. And we're going to start winning again. <APPLAUSE> It's going to be the most important vote, and you're going to be proud of your country again. And hopefully you're going to be proud of your president. And remember this... <APPLAUSE> ... this is a great moment, and I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger. It's a movement for all of us. I'm a messenger, and it's a message of common sense, and it's a message of so many different things. But it's going to be unbelievable. It's going to be unbelievable. We're going to make America wealthy again. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make America strong again. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make America safe again. <APPLAUSE> And, of course, we are going to make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-04"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. Thank you, folks. You know, this is where it all began, New Hampshire. This is where it all began. <APPLAUSE> First victory. This was our first victory and I've never forgotten it. And I made a promise to you. We're going to keep the poison out. You know what that is, the drugs. We're gonna stop those drugs. <APPLAUSE> Right -- right here is where I learned more about it than in any place else and we are gonna stop the poison from coming into this country. <APPLAUSE> You watch. You watch. In four days, we are going to win the great state of New Hampshire... <APPLAUSE> ... and we are going to win back the White House. And we've had incredible polls. You've probably seen the new Rasmussen poll just came out, we're three points up nationwide and going like a rocket. <APPLAUSE> Many, many polls. I won't even go over all the polls, but we're leading in Ohio, and Iowa, all over the place. <APPLAUSE> I think we're doing great in North Carolina. I think we're doing great in Pennsylvania too, by the way. And Florida looks beautiful. Florida looks beautiful. We have so many great polls. But you have to get out and vote on November 8th. You have to do that. We're on the cusp of historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to you, the American people. That's what's gonna happen. <APPLAUSE> That's what's gonna happen. There's more breaking news, as you probably heard, that I'd like to share with you right now. Is that OK? <APPLAUSE> As you know, the FBI now has multiple open criminal investigations into Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> This includes the discovery of another 650,000 e-mails and also a far-reaching criminal investigation into her pay for play scheme at the State Department. Last night, CBS News just confirmed that the 650,000 e-mails include brand new e-mails not previously seen by authorities.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> She said she gave them all in, right? She said, gave them all in. Well, when we saw 650,000, we figured, I guess there has to become surprises. Wait till you see what they find in those 650 too, it won't be pretty. Hillary Clinton lied to Congress under oath when she said she turned over all her work-related e-mails, and that she didn't send classified information on her illegal server. Meaning, she may now face major problems for perjury. <APPLAUSE> How can Hillary manage this country, when she can't even manage her e-mails? Did you ever see -- hey, folks, let's forget all of the stuff -- what a mess -- what a mess. All she had to do was follow the rules and assume people are watching or listening, who cares right? What a mess, and for what? Now we're going to have her running the country for four years? <BOOING> What a -- honestly, what a terrible, terrible mess. Over -- over what? Over nothing, over what should have been nothing. All she had to do was follow the rules, unbelievable. And now she is going to run the country. She will be under investigation for years, she will be with trials. Our country, we have to get back to work, right?
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> Well, one of her top people, I guess her top person said -- WikiLeaks, said she has bad instincts, what a bad thing, bad instincts. She should fire him, honestly. That would be good instincts, but she should fire him, John Podesta. In an e-mail said, Hillary has bad instincts. Do you want that for your president? Then Bernie Sanders said -- Bernie Sanders said bad judgment, but in all fairness he was running against her. So he said bad judgment. But the guy that's running her campaign says Hillary really has bad instincts. Then we're going to say, let's make her president. The FBI agents say their investigation is likely to yield an indictment, however the report also shows that the political leadership at the Department of Justice is trying as hard as it can to protect their angel, Hillary Clinton. Why didn't they protect General Cartwright, and why didn't they protect General Petraeus? Why didn't they protect a kid who's taking a couple pictures of a submarine -- that's an old submarine? And they put him in jail -- they put him in jail -- lovely family, lovely mother, they put him in jail because he wanted to have some remembrance of where he worked. It's an old submarine, believe me, they have pictures of that submarine that nobody knows about, probably, right? They put him in jail. And you see what she does and she's allowed to run for president. Folks do you know what it tells you? The system is rigged, and I've been saying that for a long time. <APPLAUSE> The system is rigged, she shouldn't be allowed to run. Hillary is engaged in massive criminal enterprise and cover-up. She created an illegal e-mail server to shield her criminal activity and corrupt pay for play. She illegally transmitted confidential information -- you're just not allowed to do that. Forget about the second go round, what she's in now. The first go around, you're not allowed to do it, you're not allowed to delete after you get subpoena. She illegally destroyed federal records, including 33,000 e- mails, which she deleted after getting that subpoena from Congress. If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis, what a mess. I mean, we went through it with him, with the impeachment and the lies, aren't we tired of this stuff?
<AUDIENCE: Yes! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> She is likely to be under investigation for a long time, concluding in a criminal trial, our president. America deserves a government that can go to work on day one and get it done. <APPLAUSE> Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as Obamacare.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And Obama, you know, he is campaigning all over the place. I left Miami yesterday, there was the plane. He is campaigning -- he ought to be in the White House working and getting our jobs back, and building up our military, and creating some semblance of a border -- which we don't have now. It's just been announced that Americans nationwide are going to experience a massive, double digit premium hike in Obamacare. In the great state of Arizona -- where I just left, and I'll be back -- premiums are going up more than 116 percent, Arizona, 116 percent. Over 90 percent of the counties in New Hampshire are losing Obamacare, they're losing the insurers, and that's going to be next year. So lot's of luck negotiating, folks, 90 percent. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof. Other than that, it's a fantastic health care, fantastic. <LAUGHTER> It's really fabulous, isn't it? It was bad before they even did it. You have to say, I'm pretty consistent -- I called a lot of things over the years, right? But I said Obamacare's not going to work before it was even approved and he got it approved -- he got it approved by lies because he said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan and even Democrats that didn't want it, they said all right, well then. And he got people -- they wish they didn't approve it now, believe me. It is a catastrophe. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive than it already is and it doesn't work. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in New Hampshire and every family in this country. <APPLAUSE> Real change also means restoring honesty to government. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption, which there's plenty. <APPLAUSE> First thing we have to do is keep Hillary Clinton out of office. <APPLAUSE> That will be a good start. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words, we -- all of us together -- are about to say. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp.
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp! (APPLAUSE)>
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs, about time. The terrible jobs report that just came out shows the number of people not in the workforce increased by another 425,000 people last month. That's why you see these phony numbers about five percent unemployed. People are stopping, they're not looking for work anymore because they can't get a job, then they take them off the rolls. These numbers are an absolute disaster. Labor force participation has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 40 years, that's what's happening. Nearly one in four people in their prime working years are not working. They want to work, they're not working. After eight years, Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of three percent growth. We're growing at any average of probably one to two percent, nobody even knows and nobody believes the numbers anyway. The numbers they put out are phony as far as I'm concerned. For millions of Americans, it's an economic nightmare. New Hampshire has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> This is the one that's hardest to believe of all. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. You people know -- New England, boy do you know it. Another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, and that's what it is when you think. We have a one way highway right into Mexico and these other places. They take our jobs and they take our money, they take out cash. You know what we get out of it? Drugs and unemployment. It's going to end, don't worry about it, folks. Don't even think about it. It's going to end. <APPLAUSE> Don't forget -- and I have to say this, because I tell this story all over the place. I learn so much in New Hampshire because I see this place, it's so beautiful. To me, it's one of the most beautiful places on Earth. You -- nice, beautiful winding roads -- even the roads, everything's so -- the trees and the little lakes and streams. And I sat down because I have so many friends up here, because I worked hard during those primaries.
<TRUMP:> Remember, I was supposed to lose the primary. I won in a landslide, right? <APPLAUSE> Remember they had the story <ph> the day before. It looks like Trump could lose New Hampshire. And the numbers came out, it was a land slide. But what I learned is -- because it was so -- it was sort of shocking because I considered -- you know, I love this kind of look. And I consider with the trees and the whole thing -- so beautiful. And I sat down with groups of people. You know, it wasn't always big rallies because I'd sit down with people. Say, ""What's the problem?"" Every single group said heroin. I said, ""heroin?"" Because it didn't make sense to me. You know, you look at the streams and the lakes and the trees and then they say heroin and it was shocking. That's why I've never forgotten it. I never forgot those meetings in every single group. And then I met with your police. You have the great -- you have such great law enforcement up here. But they said the same thing. <APPLAUSE> And so much of their crime is caused by drugs. They come from the southern border largely. And I said to you -- I said to you and you remember this, if I make it, we are going to stop that problem and then we're gonna work on all of the people who are so seriously addicted. And there are things happening -- you know, there are things happening with medicines that the federal FDA is not even releasing. They're not even releasing. There are things that come out that potentially could really help. But we're gonna work on the people that have become so seriously addicted because it's tremendous. It's not only our youth. You know, I say poisoning our youth, but it's a lot of other people. But I learned that from New Hampshire. Then I go to other states and they say very similar things. But honestly never as much fervor as drugs in New Hampshire, and it just really had a great impact. I said to you I'm gonna solve the problem if I get there. And boy, are we are getting close. Now we're getting close, right? <APPLAUSE> True. We're gonna solve it. When you see the rusted out factories and empty buildings, just remember this. Hillary Clinton's policies and others like her, her friends, did this to us, all of us. Just look at the devastation. Rockwell laid-off 169 people in Manchester and moved their jobs to Mexico. Fisher -- and these are recent. Fisher Scientific laid-off 213 people in Hudson and moved their jobs to Mexico. The woman -- I just overheard her say, ""I didn't know that."" Right? Now you know. Now you know. She was a little louder than she thought. That's OK. <LAUGHTER> She didn't know. Now she knows. Car Component Technologies laid-off 559 workers in Bedford and moved their jobs to Canada and to Mexico. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, believe me, and we will stop the jobs from leaving New Hampshire. <APPLAUSE> The theft of American prosperity will end. They have taken away our prosperity. From now on, it's going to be America first. <APPLAUSE> There'll be consequences. There will be consequences. If a company wants to fire their workers, leave New Hampshire, move another -- you know, to another country, wonderful. Enjoy yourself, right? And then ship their products back into the United States, they will pay a 35 percent tax, OK?<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> And let me just tell you a little -- right now, they move, they build, they have lots of fun and they just send it right through a very weak border. First of all, they're gonna have to send through a very strong border, but that's OK. But they're gonna have a 35 percent tax. Here's what's going to happen: they're not gonna move because it doesn't work anymore. They're not gonna move. They're gonna stay in this country. They're gonna stay in New Hampshire. They're gonna stay in this country. It's so simple. But the politicians will never approve that because the special interests and their donors want them to be able to go and -- you know, it's <ph> good for them, but it's not good for us. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers. We have to have jobs... <APPLAUSE> You know, I -- I said before, it's a one -- it's a one-lane highway. We have to have a lane coming in our direction too, folks. We have nothing. We get nothing. We will also immediately stop the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's gonna be the next disaster. <APPLAUSE> That's another beauty. That'll take the jobs you have left. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent and we'll keep our business <ph>. <APPLAUSE> We're right now the highest taxed nation in the world. And remember, Hillary wants to raise taxes, big league. We will massive cut taxes for the middle class. She wants to raise them big league. Doesn't even make sense. We will also -- that's right; $1.3 billion -- $1.6 billion.
<AUDIENCE: (OFF-MIKE) >
<TRUMP:> Trillion? Not a <inaudible>, trillion. You're right. Nobody can even believe it. One point -- go ahead.
<AUDIENCE: (OFF-MIKE)>
<TRUMP:> That's right. He read the -- he read her page. And if she says that, it's going higher. You know that. $1.3 trillion. Can you -- it's inconceivable. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Remember that. We will also cancel -- we're gonna save ourselves altogether, OK? <APPLAUSE> He says, ""Save us."" We're gonna all save ourselves. This is a movement -- I'll tell you, this is a movement like has never been before. And you know, I'd say it all the time. And they don't even question it because the dishonest media, among the world's most dishonest people. <BOOING> They don't even question. And now, we're gonna -- we're gonna -- we're gonna be so strong again and so smart again. We're gonna be -- you don't have to worry about saving. It's gonna be well beyond saving, OK? We will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations, money that we don't even know what they do with it. <APPLAUSE> We don't even know what they do with it. And use that money to support America's environmental infrastructure. For instance, up here. What we want. We want crystal clear, clean water. Right? Everybody. We want beautiful -- right? We want beautiful air to breath. We want safety. Other than that, that's all we want. The rest we want are companies to go out and compete with oil. They can't compete because of all of these restrictions. But we want clear water, clean air, and we want safety. That's to me, what I like. And that's to me -- and I've won many environmental awards by the way. I'm -- I've actually been called an environmentalist, if you can believe that. <APPLAUSE> That includes protecting the great bay and the white mountains of New Hampshire. We're gonna protect them -- they'll be protected. They'll be better protected than they are right now with a lot less intrusive nonsense. <APPLAUSE> Our plan will end excessive federal regulations that are harming fisherman on the sea coast, you know all about that. They're making it impossible. They're making it for the miners, for the fishermen. They're making it impossible for the steel workers with all the dumping of steel all over the place. We will become a rich nation again -- a truly rich nation. Some people think that doesn't sound nice -- it's not politically correct. We have to. <APPLAUSE> But to be a rich nation, we much also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. <BOOING> That's over and above the thousands and thousands being let in right now by Obama. Her plan would mean generations of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism spreading into your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. <APPLAUSE> And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Sorry. <APPLAUSE> Had no choice, we have no choice. And we all have a heart and will build safe zones in Syria, we'll help them. We all have a heart. But we see what's happening to Germany and to France and to all of these -- it's a disaster. It's a disaster. Look at Nice this summer. Look at what's going on in Paris and all of these -- all of these different places. We're gonna work, but we're -- you know, we owe $20 trillion. We're not gonna spend the money. I'll get the Gulf states to put up the money. They have tremendous money. They need us, they have to step up to the plate. They need us, we'll get them to put up the money, we'll lead the effort, and we'll build safe zones all over Syria. And we'll take care of it. We'll get other people to pay. We'll get other people to pay.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Who said that? Who? That statement could only be made in New Hampshire, I have to tell you. You people, if the press hears that statement, you'll be in trouble. But somehow I think he'll be able to handle it. A Trump administration will also secure, defend the borders of the United States. <APPLAUSE> And yes, we will build a great wall. <APPLAUSE> We received the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers. We will work with them -- these are great people but the way, would've been a lot easier if they didn't -- look, if Hillary got in, all they'd have to do is stand there and let people walk right in front of them. <LAUGHTER> These are great people. They know what is happening to our country. They see what's happening to our country. We will work with them to stop the drugs from pouring into New Hampshire and throughout the country and poisoning our youth. The immigration officers warned in a letter that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history, and that will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, it's a quote from them. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allows many, many people -- she allowed so many people, the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free, because their home countries -- very intelligently -- wouldn't take them back. We get these people that weren't supposed to be here, that are violent criminals, drug dealers, gang members, heads of gangs. We put them in a plane, we send them back, their countries say, we don't want them. We don't want them. We're not taking them. They'd call the secretary of State -- or her, or her people -- they won't take them back. That's OK, bring them back, let them out, and then they kill people. OK or they do other things that are very bad. I promise you that when we deport some real bad ones, there will never be a time when that plane -- or whatever form of transportation they want to use -- there will never be a time when that plane comes back with that person sitting in the <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> Ever, never, never happen. They don't respect us, these other countries don't have respect. Hillary supports totally open borders, there goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant, deported at least five times. A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. <APPLAUSE> We will end illegal immigration, stop the drugs from pouring into our country, deport all criminal aliens and save so many American lives. <APPLAUSE> We will also reap -- and it's just safe <ph> -- it's just -- doesn't that make sense?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester. And rebuild our badly depleted military. <APPLAUSE> Greatest people on Earth -- the greatest people. Our Navy is the smallest it's been. Listen to this, how sad, and then you see China in the South China Sea, building their fortresses and taking our money. They take our money and they build their fortresses, we'll have a great relationship, I have a great relationship with China, I've made a lot of money dealing with China, China's terrific. Look, dealing with China is great, but I'm -- and I'm not angry China for doing this stuff. I'm angry at our people for allowing it to happen. Our Navy is the smallest it has been since World War I, you believe that? We will build the 350 ship Navy that our country needs, and really is requesting, which means lots more work for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Right? Great shipyard, not too busy, but it's a great shipyard. We'll make it busy. And you know, things like that -- number one, we're building our defense, it also puts our great people to work, right? It's great. We'll also expand the center of excellence at Portsmouth to recruit a large number of skilled craftsmen like pipefitters and welders that we need to expand our fleet. I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. I was with them last night. <APPLAUSE> Near Fort Bragg -- we were right near Fort Bragg last night. We had some amazing people, we had over 20,000 people. It was the most unbelievable evening and we had tremendous numbers of admirals and generals and we had a lot of Medal of Honor winners, amazing, it was an amazing evening. Our new foreign policy will put America first. You haven't heard that for a long time. Hillary brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya, she empowered Iran and, she unleashed ISIS. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict -- and this in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could seriously lead to World War III. I think she's an unstable person to start off with, I really do. <APPLAUSE> I think she's unstable. <AUDIO GAP>
<TRUMP:> She and Obama created it through the vacuum. Hillary... <AUDIO GAP>
<TRUMP:> Wars that never end, wars that we never win. And now it's in worse shape than it's ever been before and we have to rebuild our country, folks. We could have rebuilt our country twice and the Middle East now is far worse than it was when we started this whole mess. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe and they've left our borders wide open at home. Isn't it interesting how we fight for other people's borders, lose our lives -- the lives, the money -- most important are the lives, the great lives. We lose lives, the money, and yet we want to have open borders, right? Explain that. We fight for borders for other countries -- half the people never heard of these other countries. They want borders and then we leave our borders open. And they've shipped our jobs and they've shipped our wealth to other countries. To all Americans, I say it is time for new leadership. <APPLAUSE> We need change. We need change. The last thing we need is four more years of Obama with ISIS...
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> That's really nice. I think we're going to have a great, great day on Tuesday in New Hampshire. <APPLAUSE> You know, one of the big commentators, political commentators -- I thought I'd tell you, it's only good for your ego -- but just said whoever wins New Hampshire is going to win.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> It's interesting, right? She said, ""You'll win by five."" Only five? I want more than five. Let's win. <APPLAUSE> Justin <ph> concluded. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe beyond. And Hillary wants to raise your taxes. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, killing businesses. We will cancel every illegal Obama executive order. <APPLAUSE> We are going to protect religious liberty. <APPLAUSE> Rebuild our military and take care of our great, great vets. We're going to take care of our vets. <APPLAUSE> And I mean really take care of them, not like all the lip service they've had for 25 years. Our vets -- by the way folks, are treated so poorly, the stories are horrible. Stories -- great -- that's great. <APPLAUSE> Hold that up with pride. We love you, man, we love you. That is beautiful. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to provide school choice and put an end to common core. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have education local. We will support the great men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> Something which you folks like a lot, we will save -- we will save our very much under siege Second Amendment. <APPLAUSE> And appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court, who will -- right? Who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> It's time to cut our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past. Hillary Clinton is the candidate of yesterday. We -- you -- you -- we, are the movement of the future. <APPLAUSE> Common sense, intelligence. Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We're asking for the votes of Republicans and Democrats and Independents and first time voters -- of which there are plenty. You just have to look at the lines in Florida, North Carolina and all over the place. You look at what's happening, tremendous numbers of people that haven't voted in 20 years or first time voters. We're fighting -- like him, he just said like him -- well, thank you, man. He just said, I voted."" Is that your first time? That's beautiful, thank you. <APPLAUSE> Lot of people, lot of people. I mean you have people, literally -- and they show the lines in Florida and Texas. Remember they said, Texas is in play -- two weeks ago I said, really? I thought I was doing great in Texas. These people, they're horrible people. Texas -- they go, Texas is in play and then they have the lines they're a mile long. And then you have this wonderful guy, Mr. Miller -- Sid Miller, gets on one of the shows, how are you doing in Texas? He says this is a total blowout for Trump, now they're saying it's in play. So, these lines are a mile long, we never had lines like this. And people that have never voted before are coming onto the lines wearing Trump shirts and hats and buttons falling off that. These are people that never voted. These are people that didn't give a damn for politics because they never saw anybody that they liked. They love the country as much as anybody, but they never -- like you -- but they never saw anybody that they felt good about and they didn't vote. And now they go from that, they go from being a non- political person into wearing Trump shirts and buttons. It's a beautiful thing.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> It's a beautiful thing. <APPLAUSE> But Texas is a total blowout. But you remember, right? Texas is in play <ph>. These characters. They're just bad people, the media. They are bad people. Bad people. <BOOING> And then one of them said this morning, ""We were wrong about Texas."" A total blowout. We're going to have a lot of blowouts, I think.
<AUDIENCE: Yeah! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> I'll never forget it, folks. I'm telling you, four, five days ago, before the lines formed, ""Texas is in play."" I said man, that would be terrible. I don't wanna lose Texas. That would be terrible. Total blowout. We love the people of Texas. We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. <APPLAUSE> We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family and hope and pray and yearn for a better future. I'm asking you to dream big, because with your vote, we are just -- can you believe this -- four days away. Four days away. <APPLAUSE> We're four days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. I'm ready. I'm ready. <APPLAUSE> I'm ready. He just -- a vet. He's a great veteran. He's just shouting, ""Are you ready?"" I'm ready. I promise <ph>. <APPLAUSE> I didn't need this, folks. I -- I was -- hey look, I was on the other side. I understood the other side very well. It was very nice, very enjoyable. But I love this country and we had to do this. Believe me, we had to do this. And I'm ready. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: We need Trump! We need Trump! We need Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
<AUDIENCE: We need Trump! We need Trump! We need Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. God bless you, everybody. <APPLAUSE> God bless you. Thank you very much. Thank you, New Hampshire. Get out and vote.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-04"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you, everybody. Wow! <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> This is amazing. This is amazing. Unbelievable. <CROWD CHANTING> Thank you very much. <CROWD CHANTING> Thank you very much everybody. This is amazing. And you know what, we have 7,000 people outside trying to get in, can you believe this? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> In four days we are going to win the great state of Pennsylvania... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...and we are going to win back the White House. We are going to win it back. Unbelievable, look at this, maybe because I went to school in Pennsylvania, maybe that's the reason. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Maybe. My kids went to school in Pennsylvania. A smart place, Pennsylvania. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> It's just been announced that the residents of Pennsylvania are going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike. <CROWD REACTS> No good. In the great state of Arizona, where I just left, premiums are going up more than 116 percent. <CROWD REACTS> All 67 counties in Pennsylvania are losing Obamacare insurers next year, lots of luck negotiating, folks, but it won't matter because it will be terminated, you won't have to bother. We'll have great health care at much less expense... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...much lower price. You'll be paying a fraction of what you're paying and you're going to get really good stuff, I can tell you. Premiums are surging on Obamacare, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting, and deductibles are through the roof. You have deductibles -- $13,000, $14,000, $15,000. Nobody has ever seen anything so ridiculous. And yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. <CROWD REACTS> And she also wants to, by the way, raise your taxes very substantially. I am asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Pennsylvania and our country. We're going to do it, folks. We're going to do it. Oh, boy, are we going to win -- we are going to win Pennsylvania big. Look at this. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I hear we set a new record for this building. And by the way, I didn't have to bring JLo or Jay Z, the only way she gets anybody. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I'm here all by myself. I am here all by myself. Just me, no guitar, no piano, no nothing. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> But you know what we do have and it's all of us, it's all the same, we all have great ideas and great vision for our country, that's what we have. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> So I know we have two of our great Congressman here, Tom Marino, Lou Barletta, they're here. Where are they? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> No, we love them. Folks, they're great. Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI -- and you know this -- has anybody heard? Has anybody heard? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Just a little rumor, just a little rumor, I think a couple of you have heard. As you know... <CROWD CHANTING> ...the FBI has reopened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> They are also conducting a second criminal investigation into Hillary's pay-for-play corruption at the State Department. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Last night it was just confirmed that the 650,000 -- can you believe that number -- emails they discovered include brand-new emails not previously seen by authorities. Likely, they will be classified information, loaded. However, the reports also show that the political leadership at the Department of Justice is trying very hard, actually as hard as they can, to protect Hillary Clinton from the FBI -- from the FBI. <CROWD REACTS> And I salute the FBI for taking the step. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Remember, John Podesta -- her top person -- said Hillary Clinton has bad instincts -- WikiLeaks. Bernie Sanders said she has bad judgment. So, if she's got bad instincts, I mean, if she's got bad judgment, why are we putting her to run for president, right? I mean, why is she running? Bad instincts. You know, Sanders was running against her so he says bad judgment. <Inaudible> works with her all the time, and he puts in an email that Hillary has bad instincts. That's not who we want for president, folks. And then you have President Obama, instead of getting jobs, instead of taking care of our military... <CROWD REACTS> ...instead of beating ISIS, he is out campaigning all the time. He ought to go back to the Oval Office and go to work. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> She created an illegal email server to shield her criminal activity and then she illegally destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena. The key word is after. So she gets the subpoena -- congressional subpoena. You don't get any better than that, and she said you better get rid of these. Well, she said it was about the wedding and about yoga, remember? Thirty-three thousand. But I have a feeling the 650,000 will do very nicely. If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. This will go on for years, folks. If she ever got into the Oval Office, Hillary and her special interests would rob our country blind. <CROWD REACTS> My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we are all about to say. When we win on November 8th, we are going to drain the swamp. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I keep telling people, I hated that expression. I said it's so hokey. And then one group heard it, they went crazy. Another group heard it, then we had a big, big rally in Florida. They went crazy about it, and now I love it. It's true. It's very accurate. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> The great state of Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by crooked Hillary Clinton. One of the most amazing statistics that I've ever heard, something I thought was a typographical error, America has lost, not 700, not 7,000, which I assumed it might be, has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill Clinton and Hillary backed deal. <CROWD REACTS> We are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world. Tyco laid off 808 workers in Harrisburg and Carlisle, and moved their jobs to China, India and Mexico. <CROWD REACTS> G.E. Connectivity laid off 102 workers in Middletown, and moved their jobs to China, Vietnam and Singapore. <CROWD REACTS> Codai <ph> laid off 100 workers, moved their jobs to China. Dura-Bond Pipe laid off 145 workers and moved their jobs overseas. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Pennsylvania. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> The theft of American prosperity will end. It's ending. If a company wants to fire their workers, leave Pennsylvania, move to another country like Mexico, which is taking so many of our companies, and the ship their products back into the United States where we will soon have, by the way, a very strong and powerful border. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will make them pay a 35 percent tax on those products coming in. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Now you know what's going to happen, right? They're not leaving. They won't leave. And if they do, we're going to make a lot of money. They're going to pay a lot of tax. But they won't leave, they won't leave. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much, much, much better deal for our workers. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, another disaster in the making. As part of her plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on American businesses from 35 percent to 15 percent. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will massively cut taxes for the middle class, most importantly. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And by the way, Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes very substantially. <CROWD REACTS> You saw that during the debate. By the way, who won the debates? Who won the debates? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> You know, she kept saying she is working on debate prep for weeks. Oh, she's always working on debate prep. You know, if you're doing this stuff for 35 years, why does she need so much debate prep? Like a week and a half before the debate, she was at her home. Why isn't she leaving? She is working on debate prep. I felt guilty. I mean, how much you have to learn, right? That was just an excuse to rest and go to sleep, OK? Believe me. By the way, two friends of mine -- and have to tell you -- they are -- I don't even know where they are. This is a hard one to find. I'll tell you why. You know, a great, great couple, Barbara and Hugh Rone. Do you know about their son Riley, Riley Rone? Where are they? Are they around here someplace? Where are they? Come up here if you can. Do you mind? Do you mind? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Come on, tell the Secret Service. Believe me, they're OK to come up, right? That would be the surprise of all time. These are incredible people. Their son recently passed away in a horrible accident. He was the biggest supporter I had, young guy, beautiful guy, the most popular person there was. And he was just very special. And I want to introduce -- and if you'd like to say a few words -- Riley. Riley was their son. As much as some of you like Trump, I like you more than you like me if you want to know the truth. This boy was our biggest fan. He loved our country, believe me. He loved our country. Say a few words about our boy, OK? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> <CROWD REACTS> They know him.
<RONE: This is for my son, Riley. We are from South Amboy, New Jersey, a very small, small democratic town. We are registered independents. We vote for the person, not the party. My son, Riley, was killed Memorial Day weekend, coming home from the Jersey Shore on the Garden State Parkway. My son was a late in life menopause baby, a gift from God. He was only 19 years old and my only son. I have three wonderful daughters. Riley loved Mr. Trump. He was obsessed with Mr. Trump. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) When there were 17, Riley said, ""Mr. Trump is the nominee."" When there's one nominee, Mr. Trump, Riley said, ""Mr. Trump will be president."" (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) In Riley's obituary, Mr. Trump was mentioned because Riley loved or loves Mr. Trump. Riley's funeral was over 200 cars. He has very dedicated friends. There were signs, flags for Mr. Trump. Riley's grave marker has Mr. Trump's name on it along with the Statue of Liberty because he loves America. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Richie Schnyderite, a very good friend of my son's wrote Mr. Trump a letter expressing all about my son and asked Mr. Trump if he could just mention my son, Riley, on the campaign trail because it would mean so much to my son. When Mr. Trump received the letter, he tweeted, ""God bless Riley Rone and a motorcycle... (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ...and a motorcycle group put on Facebook. They were donating a brick with Riley's name on it for the wall. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) When Mr. Trump received the letter, he wrote us a very heart- moving personal letter regarding family and Riley. We never expected to hear from Mr. Trump. We don't know Mr. Trump. He doesn't know us (inaudible). He does now. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Within weeks -- within weeks of the letter, we received a phone call from his office asking would we take a phone call from Mr. Trump. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) We were watching Fox news, and Mr. Trump was in Florida. He was sweating profusely in an airport hangar complaining of 140-degree weather. We watched him leave the stage, and within minutes our phone rang. It was Mr. Trump. He spent -- he's amazing. He spent a good amount of time on the phone with us, and it was very personal. I'm not going to share what we said, but I will share Mr. Trump said, ""If it costs millions and he would give everything he owned if it would bring my Riley back."" (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) What kind of man is this? What kind of man who is running for the highest office in our land, the president of the United States... (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ...takes out the time from his campaign to call us. God does bless us. Now, all you mothers out there, I want you to put yourself in my shoes for one minute. And you fathers, too. I want you to please, please, please vote for Mr. Donald trump in my... (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ...in my son's honor, please. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> She does a good job, doesn't she?
<RONE: Riley. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> Wow! Oh boy, I didn't expect that. So we'll dedicate this evening to Riley, OK? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Boy, that takes courage. Hard to go back to the economy after that, right? Thank you very much. That was so beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We will unleash American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will put our miners back to work. We will put our steel workers back to work. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> You know what's happened to your state with respect to miners and steelworkers, and Hillary wants to do the opposite. We're going to put them back to work. They're going to be happier than ever before. And my infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like -- did you ever hear of a place called the ""Pennsylvania Turnpike."" <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Needs some help. Needs some work. We spend all these trillions all over the place; we can't fix our potholes in the Pennsylvania Turnpike or anywhere else. Our country is going to hell. Unbelievable, you look at our infrastructure of this country. We will also rebuild our inner cities. They are so bad. The African-American community, the Hispanic community, people living in the inner cities have been treated so unfairly. They have been run for -- sometimes more than 100 years unbroken by Democrats and people with the wrong ideas. They're unsafe. You can go shot walking to the store for a loaf of red. They're unsafe. They have the worst education. They have no jobs -- no jobs. You look at unemployment rate of African-American youth, you look at it, it's 58 percent -- 58 percent. And I say, give me a chance, I will fix it. I actually go, ""What the hell do you have to lose?"" Believe me, I will fix it. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will all fix it together. It will be a great thing. We have to fix it. We have to fix it. We're going to fix it. We're going to fix the inner cities. We will become a rich nation once again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees... <CROWD REACTS> ...and that's over and above the thousands and thousands and thousands that are right now pouring into our country under Obama. Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. You know what's happened. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> You know, just in standing and watching and looking at this incredible spirit, right up to the tiny corners of the room... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...with thousands and thousands of people standing outside watching big screens, anybody want to switch places with them? <CROWD REACTS> I say, isn't it sad that the most dishonest people there are -- the media -- don't spin the cameras and show them this crowd? <CROWD REACTS> Isn't it sad? They never show the crowd. They never show the crowds. Today, Obama had a protester and the protester -- if I have one, they immediately pick out the protester even though the protesters, we just found out through WikiLeaks, were paid $1,500 to go into our rallies and be violent, right? <CROWD REACTS> And in Chicago, they badly hurt policemen. They badly hurt other people, although our people can take care of themselves very nicely. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> But whenever there's a protester, the only time those cameras move, the only time they pick out a protester because that's a negative thing, right? And yet, Obama today spoke in front of a much smaller crowd than this, by the way, and there was a protester and a protester that likes us. And what happened is they wouldn't put the cameras on them. They kept the cameras on Obama, and I said, '""That's strange."" You saw it today on television, right? He was talking to the protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him. By the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester, they would say, he became on his, he <inaudible>. <LAUGHTER> You have to go back and look and study, and see what happened. They never moved the camera, and he spent so much time screaming at this protester. And frankly, it was a disgrace. It was -- and he shouldn't be there, and he shouldn't be there to start off with. <CROWD REACTS> But I'd love to see them spin the cameras. I'd love to see them go outside and see -- I mean, this arena is massive, but I'd love to see them go outside and see the thousands and thousands of people... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...that are outside. Look at the cameras, they don't move, folks. They don't move. They don't move. They're right here. <CROWD REACTS> They don't move. They don't want to show it, folks. They don't want to show it, but they're not happy. They see the polls. We're leading in Ohio. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're leading in Iowa. We're leading in North Carolina. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're leading in New Hampshire. We're leading in Florida. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And I actually think we're leading in the great state of Pennsylvania. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I love you people, but they won't show. Watch, you go home, you won't see the crowds. They won't -- they won't talk about them. You got to see Hillary show have like 300, 400 people. <LAUGHTER> What a joke. What dishonesty. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States, and yes... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...and yes, we will build a great wall. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Build a great wall. <CROWD CHANTING> Who is going to pay for the wall? <CROWD REACTS> One hundred percent. They don't know it, but they're paying. Honestly, they do know it, they do know it and that's all right. I met two months ago with the President of Mexico, good guy. We'll work things out. We'll have better relationships with Mexico. We'll have better relationships with China. Look at China, we have a trade deficit with China of almost $500 billion a year. Think of it. China, think of it. And yet they taunt us with building a massive fortress right smack in the middle of the South China Sea. They're not supposed to be doing it. We have no relationship with China and yet they rip us. I've had a great relationship with China. The largest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in Manhattan, so many other things. We're going to have a great relationship with China, and I'm not angry at China, I'm angry at our leaders for allowing so many different countries to rip is off. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> That's who I'm angry with. All right. That will end. Does anybody have any doubt that that's -- and we will have -- honestly, we're going to have a better relationship with most of these countries. The reason is they don't respect us. They don't respect Obama. He's like a cheerleader, he's jumping up and down all over the place for Hillary. He shouldn't be doing that. He shouldn't be with her. He's got to be working. You know what, we're better off if he doesn't work. He'll only make bad deals we'll have to unscramble. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're better off. We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers, 16,500, first time they've ever endorsed a candidate. It's just been reported that as a result of our open borders, violent cartels have spread into all 50 of our states. More than 90% of those arrested are here illegally -- thank you very much. They are killing innocent <inaudible>, threatening schools and totally destroying communities. A government that will not protect its people is a government that is unworthy to lead. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands and thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminals to go free because their home countries wouldn't take them back. They bring them to their countries and very intelligently, these countries would say we don't want the murderers, drug kings, the gang members, so they'd bring them in and the countries would say, ""We're not taking them back. Bring them back to your country."" And she was head of State Department and she said bring them back, we don't want to -- believe me, I promise you this. Never once -- never once will we be bringing anybody back, never once, never once. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And if they come back into our country one year in jail, and if they come back a second time into our country, five years in jail and then 10 years in jail, and they won't be coming back. They're not going to be coming. Very few, believe me, when they know that, you know what we do, we capture them over and over and over, and we let them go. There have to be consequences, folks. There have to be consequences. Hillary supports totally open borders -- there goes your country -- and strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco... <CROWD REACTS> ...where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant. And this immigrant, this illegal immigrant was deported at least five times. Not going to happen anymore, folks. Thousands of Americans would be alive today if not for the open border policies of Obama and Clinton. This includes Americans like Josh Wilkerson, whose mother I've gotten to know during the campaign. Josh was a student in a high school, good student, good kids, everybody loved him, who's murdered at the age of 17. He was tortured, strangled, beaten to death by the illegal immigrant, and then his body was set on fire. Everybody wanted this guy out. They wanted him incarcerated. In July, right here in Pennsylvania, an illegal immigrant with a previous deportation record, horrible record, raped a young child. The illegal immigrant had been arrested for aggravated assault on numerous occasions, but he was set free. He was set free. Everybody that knew him said, ""Please, please don't set him free."" He was set free by weak, ineffective policy -- by weak, ineffective leadership. A Trump administration will end this vast nightmare of violence. We're talking about thousands and thousands of incidents. We will protect American lives. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will stop illegal immigration, deport criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal cartel that's in this country. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And by the way, our local police who are so incredible, they know every one of these people. They know everyone. They have to put with them every day. When we win, you will finally have a government on your side fighting for your community and protecting your family. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We have no choice. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> That means new resources for the nearby Army War College that will train the next generation of Army leaders. Now Mosul, I talk about Mosul because I can't believe it, first of all, we have Mosul. It was the way we got out whether you wanted to be in Iraq. You should have been in Iraq, but we had Mosul. It was all done, but then Clinton and Obama did that crazy -- get out. They got out the wrong way, so they took Mosul back. Now, four months ago, I start hearing we're going to take Mosul, we're going to take -- and I say whatever happened to the element of surprise, right? So we had Mosul, but we essentially gave it up. Now we're going to take it. By the way, just so you understand, I've never even said this before, who benefits by us getting Mosul? You know, it's going to benefit Iran. We're not going to benefit because Iran is taking over Iraq. We handed that to them along with one of the dumbest deals I've ever seen, the $150 billion back. <CROWD REACTS> The $1.7 billion in cash that we gave these people, a terrorist -- number one terrorist nation -- $1.7 billion in cash and now they feel emboldened and they go and they harass our ships and they take our 10 sailors and humiliate the sailors, humiliate our country. It's not going to happen. Well, he said, ""Never happen with you, I promise."" It will never happen with me. I promise you that. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I promise you that. But just to finish because we see the Army College, just to finish, so Mosul, we want to go into Mosul just four months ago because we want to get ISIS leaders, we think they're in Mosul. Well, if you want to get them you don't talk about it, right? You don't talk about it. You go get them and have the news conference later. Wouldn't that be nice? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I always say what ever happened to the element of surprise. So four months ago I heard it, then three months, then two months. In the meantime, you know, they're buried in there. They are using human shields. We have no choice but to take ISIS out, we have to because they're chopping off heads. They're doing things. When you read the history books not since medieval times has anything like this happen. And it formed during this period of time of Hillary Clinton. Now Hillary is saying, ""We will get ISIS."" What the hell did she let it start for? <LAUGHTER> Now ISIS is in 32 countries all around the world, and what a shame it is. We have people in leadership that are grossly incompetent. We're going to change it, we're going to change it fast, OK? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. You saw that last night, right near Fort Bragg -- great place, great people. We had 21,000 people last night. We had more people last night than I have tonight, although if you include the people outside, we may have them. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We may have them. I'm not sure. I think if you include outside, we may have more than that. Hillary Clinton brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya and she empowered Iran, and she unleashed ISIS all across the world. Hillary and our failed establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we don't win, and now the Middle East is in far worst shape and far more dangerous than it ever was before. They dragged us into foreign wars that makes us less safe, shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries, and they had left our borders wide open at home. We go into wars and we set strong borders, but at home we have no borders. We send our troops to foreign countries to defend their borders, but our politicians refuse to defend our borders. That will change on November 8th, believe me. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> That will change, November 8th. That will be a big day. A Trump administration will never ever put the interest of a foreign country before the interest of our country ever. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> To the people of Pennsylvania, to all of the people in the United States I say, from now on, it's going to be America first. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> <CROWD CHANTING> To all Americans I say it is time for change and time for new leadership. We need it. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We just cannot have four more years of Obama because that's what we're getting if we do this. It's four more years. It's ISIS running rampant. It's no borders. It's bad jobs. You see the jobs reports, they're horrible. You saw what happened just two days ago. The jobs report is a disaster, and they're all bad jobs because our good jobs are disappearing. It's -- it's no good folks. Four more years, we can't have it. Can you imagine -- can you imagine? I saw these great men, these great admirals last night, these great generals, these are great people, strong, smart. I saw these unbelievably brave recipients of the Medal of Honor, and I said to them, ""How would you feel to have Hillary Clinton as your leader?"" And they're -- they're wonderful Americans... <CROWD REACTS> ...and I refuse to tell you what they said, but it wasn't good, believe me. Can you imagine these people taking orders? These great people taking orders from her? <CROWD REACTS> Bad judgment, remember. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe bigger, and Hillary is going to raise that. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We will cancel every illegal Obama executive order... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...protect religious liberty... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...that <inaudible>, that <inaudible>. It's time. Rebuild our military and take care of our great, great veterans, our great people. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> They've been horribly, horribly taken care of. Provide school choice and put an end to common core, we're bringing our education local. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And today in New York City, two policemen were -- as you know, were horribly shot. It goes on and on and on. We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is totally under siege... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...and appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, so important. It's time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past. Hillary Clinton is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We are the movement of the future. This is a great movement. This is a movement that's never happened before ever in the history of our country, ever in the history. There's never been anything like it. And I will say -- and I understand how the system works, I understand the system, I guess, as well as anybody understands. I was on the other side. I was enjoying it very much. I also love our country and it can no longer work that way, it's not fair. It can no longer work. We won't have a country. And boy, oh boy, so I went from being an insider. Did I ever become an outsider? Wow! I became a serious outsider. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> But we're all outsiders, and that's the way we like it. We're all outsiders, but it's a movement like it's never been seen before. And even of the dishonest people back there and the pundits, they say -- some of them say it's the single greatest political phenomena that they've ever seen in this country. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And it is. And that's why we cannot do anything that's going to stop it. We have to get out. Pennsylvania, you are so important. Everyone talks Pennsylvania, if you win Pennsylvania, you're going to win, Pennsylvania. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Now we're doing great all over the state. And I really believe I'm going to do well in Philadelphia because that's where I went to school specifically. I love Philadelphia. Don't disappoint us, Philadelphia. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We'll do great things for Philadelphia. But there's so much about Pennsylvania that's so important. And get out November 8th and vote. We are fighting for every parent who lost their child to gangs and drugs and violence. We are fighting for every community who's jobs have been ripped out and shift to other countries. And we are fighting for every American who believes government should serve the people not the donors and not the special interests. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I'm asking you to dream big because with your vote, can you believe this? We're just four days away. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> You will get the change you've been waiting for for your entire lifetime. And -- and folks, I'll tell you what, it's not going to happen again. It's not going to happen in four years. It's over. This is it. He's just saying that's it. This is it, folks. In four years, it's going to be a whole -- it will never -- it will never ever happen again. It's our last chance, the last chance. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will make America safe again. We will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you everybody. Go out and vote. Thank you.

<date:""2016-11-04"">
<TRUMP:> What a place. Have you been seeing what's happening with those polls? They're like rocket ships. They're like rocket ships. <APPLAUSE> I tell you it's been great. I love Ohio. I love Ohio. <APPLAUSE> I worked in Ohio, did well in Ohio, gave me confidence to go out with life. Right at the beginning I was in Ohio, so we love it. Thank you everyone for coming. In four days, we are going to win the great State of Ohio and we are going to win back the White House. New polls just out have us with a very substantially lead in Ohio, nationwide. Many of the states, we're looking great in Florida, we're looking great in North Carolina, we are looking great in the state of Pennsylvania, we just left New Hampshire, we have a lead in New Hampshire. These very dishonest people back there, the media, they're getting a little worried. They're getting a little bit worried, this wasn't supposed to happen. This was not supposed to happen. You can vote early in person or you can show up on November 8th. Who has voted? Whoa, not great. But you're saving it for November 8th I think, correct? You want to be traditional, right? Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing horrible ObamaCare. It's just been announced that the residents of Ohio are going to experience massive, massive problems with their ObamaCare, you know about that I guess, right? You know about it. It's a serious problem, it is a serious problem and you're going to have numbers, in the great State of Arizona it's gone up 116 percent, okay, 116 percent. So you're going to have a lot of problems, we're going to work on it very hard, 88 counties in Ohio are losing at least three ObamaCare insurers a year, okay? So next year, you're going to have almost, almost nobody even to negotiate with by next year but it's not going to matter because if we win the election, you're not going to have ObamaCare to worry about. You're not going to have ObamaCare, nothing to worry about believe me. And we are going to have great healthcare at a much lower price and it's going to be something you're going to be very proud of. Right now, it's an international joke, ObamaCare, it's an international joke. <APPLAUSE> Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting, I know so many doctors, they've quit and generally speaking, deductibles are going through the roof, some higher than others, we have deductibles I've heard as high as $15,000 or $16,000. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on ObamaCare, making it even more expensive. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace ObamaCare and save healthcare for every family in Ohio, but more importantly because we don't want to think of ourselves, for every family in the United States. <APPLAUSE> It's a big problem. It is a big problem. Real change also means restoring honesty to government, so we ought to start by getting rid of Hillary Clinton. The FBI now has multiple open criminal investigations going on Hillary Clinton, lots of bad things are happening, lots of really bad things are happening, but I'll tell you what, you're going to be amazed when it's all finished, when you look at how it's all fleshing out. The system is a beautiful system when it works, we have a rigged system so many times, you see this. I mean, you have things going on that are incredible, that includes a discovery of another 650,000 emails and also a criminal investigation into her pay for play corruption at the State Department, amazing. Last night it was just confirmed that the 650,000 emails include brand new emails not previously seen by authorities, likely including classified information. Hillary is now facing major problems with perjury. The FBI agents say their investigation is likely to yield perhaps an indictment. I love them. I love them. The reports also show that the political leadership at the Department of Justice is trying as hard as they can to protect their angel, Hillary, this is no angel. They want to protect their angel. Did we ever have a situation like this, seriously? <APPLAUSE> First of all, forget about as of last Friday with the new 650,000 emails that was found, forget that. She should have been disqualified for running for president from the first batch of emails and from all of the crimes that have been committed. I mean, take a look at the first batch, why do we even have to go? Now, we're doing it, ""Oh, look what we found."" How many times do we have to do this?"" I believe the FBI wanted to do it and she was protected by friends of hers at the Department of Justice. That's the department where as you know the attorney the general was on the airplane, now they say it was for 45 minutes talking about the grandchildren and talking about golf for 45 minutes. I don't think so. I think they were talking about a position, in other words, a continuation of a position. I think that's what they were talking about folks. Hillary has engaged in a criminal massive enterprise and cover- ups like probably nobody ever before. Remember John Podesta said she has bad instincts. And as you know as I was getting off the plane, they were just announcing new WikiLeaks and I wanted to stay there but I didn't want to keep you waiting, I didn't want to keep you waiting. Let me run back into the plane and find out. I didn't want to go - oh, there were some beauties coming out and I'm saying, ""Do I listen for another"" - you know, you can listen for hours. But think of it, John Podesta, her top person, said she has bad instincts. Who the hell wants a president where the person that knows her best said her instincts are bad. Now Bernie Sanders said she has bad judgment, but at least he was running against her, right? But the person working with - I tell you what, I would fire Podesta very quickly if I were Hillary, he should be fired. And honestly, shouldn't Huma be fired? Huma. I mean, can you imagine, ""Did you get rid of all the emails?"" ""Yes, ma'am, they're all gone. Yes, ma'am."" This has gone now for months. ""Did you get rid of the emails?"" ""Yes ma'am, they're gone. We deleted 33,000 of them, they're all gone. I think we're in the clear."" And then they find out going through a pervert's file, Anthony Weiner, anybody in New York knows all about Anthony Weiner. And I predicted it a year ago, did you hear me, right? And I said all the things I said and they all said, ""What a horrible thing to say."" I turned out to be right and even some of these very dishonest people in the media said, ""Trump really called that one."" I called a lot of them. I called a lot of them. But can you imagine Huma - I got rid of them, they're all gone. Thirty thousand, didn't I do a good job? And then they find out, ""Uh-oh, we got bad news boss. I think they went on the cloud,"" you know the cloud? Never disappears off the cloud. So those people when they advertise the cloud, ""Never disappears."" She said, ""Boss, we have bad news for you, they just found 650,000 emails."" Can you imagine? And I'll tell you, some of those emails, all - I would bet anything, some of those emails are so bad, they're so classified, they're beyond classified. They have emails there that are beyond classified. And it's all coming down because I've always had a lot of confidence in the FBI, I tell you. We have amazing people in the FBI and they're not happy. They're not happy about what's happening and they're not happy about the way they're being pushed around. And you don't push them around for long, believe me. <APPLAUSE> She created an illegal email server to shield her criminal activity and corrupt pay for play and then she illegally destroyed 33,000 emails after - this the big key, after, that's the key word, after receiving a congressional subpoena, so after. So she gets the subpoena and she says get rid of it and that's fine. And yet, they put a four star general last week, James Cartwright, highly respectable, current four star general, they may put him in jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison. General Petraeus suffered horribly, reputation destroyed for doing nothing by comparison. They took the kid who wanted some pictures of the submarine, that's an old submarine, they've got plenty of pictures, if the enemy wants them, they've got plenty of them. He wanted to take a couple of pictures, they put him in jail for a year. I saw his mother the other night on television. I tell you what folks, we've never been in a situation like this and if she's allowed to run for president then General Cartwright should put in jail for doing peanuts. And he said he did it - and he said he did it for - he said that he lied for national security purposes. Who knows? But he did nothing by comparison to what she's done. If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. She is likely to be under investigation for a long time concluding probably in a criminal trial. Hey look, we all want to go through a process and we want to make sure everyone is guilty properly, guilty properly, everything has to be perfect, but she did things where - and we have a trial, have to go with, but she's guilty. She's guilty. She took the emails and that's the least of what she did. She got rid of emails, that's the least of what she did. If she ever got into the Oval Office, Hillary and her corrupt friends would rob this country blind. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words we all are about to say, we all - are you ready? Isn't it amazing how this phrase has gone up? I didn't like it, I thought it was corny, I don't know where they really sort of a corny phrase I didn't like it. When we win in November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. I thought it was corny and then I went to one rally and another and they're all screaming, ""Drain the swamp"" but Frank Sinatra didn't like My Way, he didn't like until he sang it, the audience went crazy, sang it again, became number one, all of a sudden, he loved it very much. <APPLAUSE> At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Ohio has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by crooked Hillary Clinton. America has lost - this is one of the hardest things to believe because it doesn't seem physically possible. Seventy thousand factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill- and Hillary-backed disaster. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, it's true. It's the single greatest jobs theft, you take a look at what's happened not only in Ohio. You look at upstate New York, you look at Pennsylvania, you look at North Carolina, you look at South Carolina, you look at what's going on, look at New England, boy they got hit. General Motors lay off 1,151 workers in Moraine and moved their jobs to Mexico, China, and various other countries. Faurecia laid off 356 workers in Troy, anybody from Troy? Good, do you still have your job? And moved their jobs to Mexico. Delphi laid off 5,805, what's with Delphi? You know about that, right? Five thousand eight hundred and five workers in Dayton. Boy oh boy, that's a lot of jobs, and moved their jobs to Mexico. We have a one-way highway going into some of these countries especially Mexico. Everything goes in, I always say, they get the jobs, the plants, the money, we get the drugs, we get the unemployment, it's a one way street. Not going to happen anymore folks, it's not going to happen anymore. <APPLAUSE> There have to be consequences. When that happens, there's going to be consequences. We're going to fight - oh, don't worry about it, we'll build the wall, it's going to be a great wall too. It's going to be a great wall. And every time I see a Delphi and every time I see these companies leaving, that wall gets a little bit higher, it's going up. It's going to be a great wall. We're going to fight for workers and we're going to fight so Delphi and these other companies don't leave us, and there's going to be consequences because the people got a raw deal and they deserve so much better. <APPLAUSE> A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving Ohio and from leaving America and we'll stop the jobs, I'll tell you what, like you've never seen before, it will happen quickly. The theft of American prosperity will end. If a company wants to fire their workers, leave Ohio, move to another country, build their big beautiful factory, ship their products back into the United States, we will make them pay a 35 percent tax going through a very strong wall, it's going to be a very strong wall. <APPLAUSE> And you know what's going to happen? They're not going to leave, not going to leave. Now, the politicians could do something about this. How long have we been talking about this, 15 years, right? It got really bad over the last five or six years, really bad. It's gotten to be catastrophic, catastrophic. But they know this. I mean some do and some don't, some are not exactly - I won't say it, some aren't too bright. Some aren't too bright. And some are getting tremendous amounts of money from donors and from people that want to see those companies leave, they have reasons for the companies to leave, including ownership interest in those companies. The problem is, the politicians are working for those donors, they're not working for the American people, they're not working for all the people that got fired from what were good jobs. So what's going to happen is they want to leave and the ones who do leave, that's okay too because the country will make a fortune because that's going to be called a consequence, we can stop it dead. And as we see speak right now, you have leaders in your company going out right now as we're speaking, you have leaders going out trying to negotiate deals to leave Ohio and other places, go to Mexico, go to another countries. But don't worry about it, because if I get elected, there'll be very little negotiation. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers, I want free trade, I want fair trade. You know, everyone wants free trade, we keep calling it free trade. Well I want free trade too but I really want fair trade, fair for this country and for our workers. That's what it's going to be, we're going to have fair, fair trade. <APPLAUSE> We will also immediately stop this job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership from happening, that's going to be, that's another NAFTA potentially. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We will massively cut taxes for the middle class. We will also unleash American energy including shale, oil, natural gas, and clean coal. We're going to put our miners back to work, we're going to put our steel workers back to work. <APPLAUSE> We will cancel billions of dollars of global warming payments to the United Nations. By the way, nobody even knows what happens to that money. I could tell you I have some pretty good ideas, but nobody even knows what happens and we will use that money to invest in America, that includes projects like improving Interstate 71 does anybody like that idea? You got to like it a lot otherwise, let's save the money. You know, we owe $20 trillion, okay? If you like the idea of improving the interstate? I mean, it's not exactly - you're not thrilled by it, let's not do it then, let's save the money and replacing the Brent Spence Bridge in Cincinnati, you like that? Which is critical to the region, you like that one better. You know, we should do that. Before we do a project, have a big rally, how do you like doing the interstate? People go, ""ahhh"" how do you like doing the bridge? Oh, we love it. It's not a bad way actually. We will also rebuild our inner cities. We will become a rich nation once again. You know, our inner cities are in terrible shape, the African-American community has been absolutely mistreated by the people running the inner cities for so many years, up to a hundred years, unbroken and we're going to fix and invest in our inner cities, we're going to bring our jobs back into the inner cities. The crime is unbelievable, it's staggering, the crime. Thousands and thousands of shootings in Chicago just since the beginning of the year, we're going to fix our inner cities. Jobs back, good education, and safety. And I say to the African-American community, I say to the Hispanic community, and I've said it, ""What the hell do you have to lose? I mean, what have you got to lose?"" We're going to make our inner cities wonderful places, safe, good education, and jobs. And you know, the Democrats for years they've taken advantage, ""We want your vote. We want your vote. We want your vote."" <APPLAUSE> You give them the vote and then they'll say, ""So long folks, see you in four years."" That's what happened. I will fix your inner cities and you'd be so proud of them, you're going to be so proud of them. To be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. Murder rates have experienced the largest single increase in 45 years. Now, the dishonest media has attend to that, they don't want you to know that. Firearm-related deaths to police officers are up 45 percent. Just now, just a couple of hours ago, two New York City police officers, supposed to be two great people were shot in the Bronx, badly, badly shot. We send our thoughts and prayers to the officers and their families. Just happened moments before I left the plane. Unbelievable. A Trump administration will protect those who protect us and we will stop this tremendous surge in murder. We will also keep America safe from terrorism. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country, that's above the thousands that are coming in now under the Obama Plan, 550 percent above the thousands already coming in. Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism, and it's something we can't allow to happen. They'll be in our schools, they'll be in our communities and honestly, we want to take care of people and we have to and we'll help them. We'll build safe havens, we'll get the Gulf States who have nothing but money and they haven't done their job, they will pay for it, we're not paying for it. We have 20 trillion, we're not paying for it. When I'm elected president, so we will take care of it. We want - everybody here wants to take care of it. But we don't want to end up like France, you see what's happening in Paris and Nice, you see what's happening in Germany, the problems - we have enough problems in our country. We will suspend the Syrian refugee program and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell of our country. <APPLAUSE> And we have a president - by the way, all he does is campaign. Shouldn't he back like trying to get jobs and working on ISIS and maybe not giving a four month notice that we're going into Mosul to attack them? You saw that whole situation. We will be attacking Mosul in four months. I say, ""Why? Don't tell that, I don't want to hear that."" Because we are going to capture the leaders of ISIS by attacking Mosul. You see what's going on, right? I say it all the time. And every military leaders, General Flynn who is great, General Kellogg, they're all saying, ""You're so right."" And we're going to attack. So we have a president frankly doesn't know what the hell he's doing, he doesn't what. Look at what's happening with so many things, whether it's jobs, but why is he spending all his time campaigning for somebody under federal investigation? All he does is campaign and campaign. He ought to be back in the Oval Office, he ought to be back there working, he ought to be back there working. <APPLAUSE> Now I have a lot of good suggestions out there with that. So we're going to make our country strong again. We're going to build up our military which is still badly depleted, so badly depleted. You know, these are the greatest people there are, and we have old equipment, we have old fighter jets, we have old planes and guns and everything. The enemy has newer and better equipment than we do in many cases. Recently they had a documentary on the jets, they're 18, 19 years old. You saw it, a lot of the people saw it. Where they can't replace the parts, they can't replace the parts. They have to go to plane graveyards and plane museums because they're don't make the parts anymore. So all of these things are happening, we are going to have a top-notch, modern military, we don't have a choice, we don't have a choice. <APPLAUSE> We are going to do something else. How many vets are in the audience? Wow, that's a lot of vets. We are going to take care of our vets and we're going to take care of them properly. We have illegal immigrants coming into the country that are taken better care of than our vets, and that's not going to happen, that's not going to happen. Our vets are waiting on line for five days, six days, seven days, ten days to see a doctor for a simple procedure or a simple prescription It's not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen. <APPLAUSE> You know that and this is a number, two numbers are the hardest to believe. That we lost 77,000 factories, that I told you about, 77. I thought they meant 700 factories or 7,000, 77,000. The other one is that we have a suicide rate of 22 vets a day. I said, that can't be right. You mean 22 a year? No, 22 a day. And a lot of that is because of the horrible, horrible situation that's taking place run by the Veterans Administration. And this has been going on for years. And Hillary Clinton said it's fine, it's just fine the way it is. You know that. She says it's just fine the way it is. And that's I think during the debates it was very interesting and I did win the debates, in all fairness. Did you see where she said, all the time, I'm in debate prep. Hillary Clinton is debating, I mean, she's in debate prep. She is in debate prep. She was in there for weeks. You know what is was, it was really an excuse for her to go sleep and rest. She was in debate prep. And I kept hearing and I felt guilty. She'd slept like a week and half before and she was in debate prep, she wasn't in debate prep. And the truth is if you don't know the subjects so well that you have to prep for two weeks you're the wrong person anyway. But it was really an excuse for her to sleep and to rest, okay. But we did well, so we did win the debates, right, every poll. Every single poll said we won the debates. <APPLAUSE> But I learned something in the debates, because she's saying we will fight ISIS, we will do this, we will do that. We don't like what you did with taxes. Donald Trump. I said, well, that's okay, why didn't you change the tax code? By the way, all of her friends do the same thing, it's all rightm but why don't you change the tax code? You were there, you were a senator, the Secretary of State, you're with -- I mean you were the wife of a president. She doesn't like it, you know, so like what? She's like a critic, she complains but she'll never do anything about it. She said we'll get rid of ISIS. Well there was no ISIS when she became the Secretary of State. ISIS formed during her tenure, right? It came out of the back-end because the way they got out of Iraq was unbelievably stupid and ISIS formed. Now they're in 32 countries. She has zero chance of getting rid of ISIS. I have 100 percent chance, 100 percent chance. <APPLAUSE> We have no choice, this is like we're living in medieval times. This isn't like it's war and people get shot and people get killed and it's horrible. This is people's heads are chopped off by the hundreds and by the thousands, and if you're a Christian you have no chance. And it's very hard, you know, if you're in Syria, I've heard this for years <inaudible>, even before the migration. If you're a Christian it was almost impossible to come into the United States, almost impossible. And yet these people were under this horrible, horrible rule and they were being decimated and killed, and by the way, the evangelicals, Christians, Jews, Catholics, I have such tremendous support it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. So we're going to do things that are going to make you very proud. We're going to be strong again. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And as I have said, when these young attractive people started screaming they want the wall, we will build a wall that will make you so happy, for that group over there. A lot of youth here. We're going to build a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for the wall. <APPLAUSE> And the reason -- we're going to have a great relation -- I was with the Mexican president a short while ago, very nice, we had a great meeting. But Mexico is beating us at the border, they are killing us on trade. We have a trade deficit with Mexico that nobody would believe. It's a fraction of what we're talking about with respect to the cost of the wall, because a lot of politicians ask me the question, how are you going to get Mexico to pay? I said, well, when you see the trade deficit, billions and billions of dollars. And if you look at the cost of the wall then you will understand how easy it's going to be. So we're going to build a wall and it's going to be a great wall. And Mexico is going to pay for the wall, we're going to stop those drugs from pouring in and poisoning our youth. We are going to stop it. And it will be a great wall. Maybe someday they'll name it after Trump, who the hell knows. <APPLAUSE> I really don't want it on the wall but that's... We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border control officers. It's just a report that as a result of our open borders violent transnational cartels have spread into all 50 of our states. You've read that. More than 90 percent of those arrested are here illegally, so 90 percent of the people that are here doing the things that you and I know they're doing are in our country illegally. They're killing innocent Americans and others, threatening schools and totally destroying communities. A government that will not protect its people is a government unworthy to lead, unworthy to lead. And when you think of it -- think of it with respect to radical Islam where you have a president that won't mention the words, and you have a candidate that wouldn't say radical Islamic terrorism. How can you solve the problem if you refuse to acknowledge it? Hillary will never protect your family which is why she can never lead this country, but that's only one reason why. The other reason why is that she's guilty of so many crimes. And that's why it's a rigged system, because she should not be allowed to run. And when you look at what's going with her protection, you'll understand exactly what I'm saying when I say rigged system. You can ask Bernie Sanders about a rigged system. The mistake he made -- when he endorsed Hillary Clinton, he made a deal with the devil and his stock went way down. And we are going to get a lot of the Bernie Sanders people supporting us, because he was right about one thing, he was right about the borders and trade, and you know what, I'm much tougher on trade than he was ever, ever, a lot of his people are coming forward, should've never made a deal. <APPLAUSE> Yes, he would have gone down as a great presidential in political history had he not made that deal. And now he just goes out and speaks before small crowds. And then you see WikiLeaks, all the bad things they say about him. That alone should just stop him, that alone should stop. And just like I said, that's why Hillary should fire Podesta - how do have people working that say these horrible things about you? Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks. The immigration officers warned in their letter when they endorsed me that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in United States history. It would lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives. And they know what they're talking about, folks. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton allowed many, many, many people, the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free, because their home countries refused to take them back. Now, I don't blame their home countries but when we catch drug lords, killers, gang members and we bring them back to their home country, I give you my word there won't be one instance where that country doesn't take those people. And we are going to have a plan because they keep coming back, and back, and back, and back because we're weak and we're ineffective. When they come back, five years in jail, when they come back again, more than five years in jail, and when they come back a third time much longer than that. <APPLAUSE> Let me tell you, folks, they're never coming back. It's a very simple solution. They're never coming back. They come back 12 times, 13 times, they look at us and they laugh. <APPLAUSE> Hillary supports totally open borders, there goes your country, and strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times. Here in Ohio, 60-year-old Margaret Kostelnik <ph> was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant last July in nearby Concord Township. Earlier that day her illegal immigrant killer attempted to rape a 14-year-old girl and shot another woman while she was with her children in the park. Police had encountered the illegal immigrant more than three weeks before the crime spree, but federal authorities refused to take him in, just refused take him into custody. He was set free and then he went out and killed Margaret. And people that knew him by the way were begging, begging that he'd be incarcerated. But our weak immigration policies are responsible for many, many deaths, many deaths. A Trump administration will end this nightmare of violence. We will protect American lives. We will cancel all federal funding for sanctuary cities. We will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens, and dismantle every last criminal cartel, and it will happen within the first weeks of my presidency. <APPLAUSE> When we win, you will finally have a government on your side, fighting for your community and protecting your family. We will also repeal the Obama Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our so badly depleted military. We will build new advanced aircraft at places like Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. You like that one. I like it too. Okay. <APPLAUSE> I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and more than 22 Medal of Honor recipients, they were with me last night. We were in Fort Bragg. That was an amazing evening. We had 21,000 people last night, the most incredible, brave people you've ever seen. <APPLAUSE> Hillary brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya, she empowered Iran, and she unleashed ISIS across the world. That's what she did, through incompetence, through gross incompetence. She and Obama unleashed ISIS. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria, in conflict with a nuclear armed Russia that could easily lead to World War III. She's an unstable person, folks. I know my people. She's an unstable person. Look at the way she handled this email mess. Do you want that handling our country? Hillary and our failed establishment have spent, listen to this one, this is the number, $6 trillion in the Middle East that we never win that go on forever, we never win. I wonder what General MacArthur would say. I wonder what General George Patton who is spinning, they're spinning in their graves. They've made us less safe. They've shipped our jobs and our wealth to other countries, and they've left our borders wide open at home. We send our troops to fight and die and defend their borders but we don't care about our borders, we're more interested defending the borders of countries that a lot of people have never even heard of. It's unbelievable. Think of it. We fight to defend the border in some place far away, but we don't even have borders in our country. That will change on November 8th. And by the way, the truth is I want people to come into our country. We are going to have, he just said it, a big and beautiful door. We're going to have the big, beautiful doors but they are going to come into our country legally, really. They are coming into our country legally. And the process is going to be speeded up and it's going to be brought into a modern age. It's now archaic. People on line for 10 to 12 years, but people are going to come and we want people to come into our country, but they are going to come in through a process, they are going to come in legally. A Trump administration will never ever put the interests of a foreign country before the interests of our country. I'm not running to be president of the world, believe me, I'm running to be president of our great United States of America. And from the day I take office it will be always America first. <APPLAUSE> To all Americans, I say it's time for change and it's time for new leadership. Can you imagine four years of Hillary Clinton? I mean, seriously, forget about running, forget about the race, can you imagine four more years of ISIS, four more years of high taxes, four more years of nothing but problems, in addition to all of the legalities that she's done, aya-yay, I don't even like to think about it. Just think about, in closing, what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We are going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. She is raising taxes, very seriously. You saw her tax increase, it's massive. You know, we are the highest taxed nation in the world and she wants to raise taxes. We are going to eliminate so many different things, but our taxes are going to weigh it down. And we're going to get rid of all unnecessary job-killing regulations. We are going to cancel every illegal Obama executive order. We will protect religious liberty, rebuild our military, and we are going to take great care, as I've said, of our veterans, provide school choice and put an end to Common Core, we're bringing education local. We will support the great men and women of law enforcement. We're going to save our Second Amendment which is under siege, and appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will hold, and you know this. This is one of the most serious things. Justice Scalia died very unexpectedly. We have one. The next president could appoint as many as three or four, I mean there's even a scenario, it could be five. If we don't get this right we will not have a country. Many people think it's like the most important thing. So we are going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and protect the Constitution of the United States. For all those people that don't even mention that, it's one of the really important elements to what we're doing and one of the very most important things that we are going to be doing. <APPLAUSE> It is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past. Hillary Clinton is a candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. We are fighting to save everything, honestly, we're fighting to save everything. We're not just looking at having a strong military and having -- we are fighting to save everything, our country is a total mess. You just take a look. You just take a look. We are also fighting to get rid of sanctuary cities. We are fighting to get rid of sanctuary cities. We are fighting to save the next worker from being laid off when their job is shipped unexpectedly to another country. We are fighting to save our government from crime and corruption. You look at what's happening, our government is being eaten alive. Cronyism, and kick the crooks out of Washington D.C. Don't let the pundits, the politicians or the media tell you what kind of a country you have. Don't let them limit your dreams, because they want to limit your dreams. You can have any future you want. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in America again. <APPLAUSE> I am asking you to reject the cynics and to dream big, because with your vote -- we are just four days, can you believe it? Four days, this started on June 16th of last year. It seemed like it was never going to end. Seventeen people, 17 people, one by one, by one, they said Donald Trump is inexperienced. I've been in politics all my life but I've been on the other side of the equation I must say. But one, by one, by one and then they disappeared. Some great people, Ben Carson supporting us, incredible. Mike Huckabee. So many great, I mean, so many great, almost of them, great people, and we actually do have a very unified Republican Party, I will tell you, but most importantly we're going to make such great decisions for this country. <APPLAUSE> We're going to make such great -- you're going to be so proud. So think of it, June 16th of last year, and now it's four days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. You're going to think back to this day and you're going to say that was a great day. That was a beautiful day. I even like Mr. Trump's plane, made in America by the way, it was great, made in America. And they don't make them like that anywhere else. But you are going to say this was a very, very important day because it led to your vote on November 8th or whenever you do it, before that is fine, just as long as you do it, do it any time you want, but do it. And our country started winning again. We started winning with trade. We started doing things properly. We built up our military. We knocked the hell out of ISIS. We started winning again. We took care of healthcare. We got great healthcare at a much, much, much lower cost, it's unacceptable, but we started winning again. Together we are going to make America wealthy again. We will make America so very strong again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. <APPLAUSE> Get out and vote. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. ","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-05"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. Wow. Wow. <Applause.>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much, folks. Now, we have a little difficulty because we have about 3,000 people, maybe 4,000 outside. Should we wait for them to come in?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> I agree. Let's get going. You people were here from, like, 2:00 in the morning, they tell me. <APPLAUSE> But we're going to get going. Thank you very much. And we don't need Jay-Z to fill up arenas, you know. We do it the old-fashioned way. We do it the old-fashioned way, folks, we fill them up because you love what we're saying and you want to make America great again. That's about it. <APPLAUSE> And I actually like Jay-Z, but, you know, the language last night, oh, ooh. I was thinking, ""Maybe I'll just try it."" Should I use that language if I want to...
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> Can you imagine if I said that? So -- he used every word in the book. I won't even use the initials because I'll get in trouble. They'll get me in trouble. He used every word in the book last night. And by the way, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, last night, we had an arena. We had 27,000 people show up, maybe they couldn't get in. Far more -- far more than Jay-Z had with their free tickets. Free tickets. Far more. And Beyonce. And I like them both. But he used language last night that was so bad, and then Hillary said, ""I did not like Donald Trump's lewd language."" <LAUGHTER> My lewd language. I tell you what -- I've never said what he said in my life. But that shows you the phoniness of politicians and the phoniness of the whole system, folks. <APPLAUSE> In three days, we are going to win the great state of Florida. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to win back the White House. <APPLAUSE> Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> It's just been announced that the residents of Florida -- I'm sorry to tell you this -- are going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike. And I know what it is. I say this to everybody. I know -- I just don't want to destroy the spirit in the room. It's going to be a massive hike. So, congratulations. It's not going to matter, because if we win, I'm throwing it out anyway. So it doesn't make any difference. But get ready. You're going to have a big, big, big hike. Hopefully, it won't make a damn bit of difference. In the great state of Arizona, where I was just a couple of days ago and where I'm going, premiums are going up by more than 116 percent. <AUDIENCE BOOS> Going to go higher than that. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insure. And think of it. They're losing their insurers. Over 90 percent of the counties. And remember -- and most of you were there -- almost all of you felt this whole movement right from the beginning when we came down for the primaries, right? We won 66 out of 67 counties, 66 out of -- Florida is just a place I love. My second home. I'm here all the time. <APPLAUSE> I might know Florida better than you do. But my second home. But we won 66 out of 67 counties. That's never happened before. We almost -- we almost won that last one, too. And I see maybe even more enthusiasm right now than I did then. I think there's more enthusiasm. <APPLAUSE> You see the tremendous lines of people, and they have Trump hats on, make America great again. But they have Trump hats on and they have buttons and they have shirts, and they're on line, and you see NBC, and you see these people... <AUDIENCE BOOS> Total phonies. The most dishonest people. And they'll say, it looks like it's going -- there was one line where it was like 100 percent with Trump regalia. Now, maybe they're in disguise, maybe they're wearing buttons, shirts, and Trump hats, but they're actually going to vote for crooked Hillary. Do you think that's possible?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> But you see these lines, and the woman says, ""Yes, I'd say it's very evenly based."" So the great state of Texas, you heard -- you heard -- can you believe all these people at 10 o'clock in the morning -- great. They got here at 2 o'clock in the morning, many of them. So the great state of Texas, an incredible place. I go there. We have these massive crowds. And about two weeks ago, I was hearing the phonies in the media, and they're going, very, very strongly, ""Texas is in play."" Oh, we have a Hillary Clinton person. Are they paying that person $1,500? <AUDIENCE BOOS> Get 'em out, please. Get 'em out.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> I must tell you, the Bernie Sanders protesters had much more enthusiasm and spirit than this one. The problem with these Hillary protesters is my people make all the noise. They're always going there, there. You can't even hear the person. By the way, did you see -- before I get to Texas, did you see yesterday Obama screaming and screaming... <AUDIENCE BOOS> ... and screaming? Just like the way he runs the country. Nobody listens to him. Screaming, OK? And I wanted to see the protesters, because these lying, thieving people back there, the media, they don't ever show -- they don't ever show my crowds. <AUDIENCE BOOS> I was saying to them the other night, Hershey, I was saying, ""You've got to show -- you've got to turn the camera."" They just -- every one of them right up my face, right? The only time they'll turn the cameras is if there's a protester, because that's a bad thing, right? So last night, Obama had a protestor, and they wouldn't turn the camera to the protester. It's the first time I've ever seen that. They kept it on him, but it was bad, because he kept screaming the same thing over and over again. And nobody would listen to him. But they had the great state of Texas, so -- about three weeks ago, they'd say -- you know, they do these phony polls, right? Some of the polls are great. I only really acknowledge them if I'm winning, so -- and by the way, we're winning in a lot of polls! <APPLAUSE> A lot of polls. <APPLAUSE> We don't have enough time to talk about it now. There's too many of them. Oh, I love those signs, ""Blacks for Trump."" Ho-ho-ho, oh. That seems to be -- that seems to be the big surprise so far of this election, ""Blacks for Trump."" Thank you, fellas. That's so great. Thank you so -- that is great. Thank you. Thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> That's a great honor. Believe me, that's a great honor. So they kept saying, ""The great state of Texas is in play."" Now, you know, it's supposed to be sort of a Republican stronghold. Not supposed to be in play. I said, oh, man, I call my people. What's going on with Texas? Because I was just there, we had a crowd, 20,000, 22,000, 15,000, every time I went. We had these massive crowds. They had a line that went so long that local media is much more honest than these dishonest guys, you know. The local media -- and they were showing the line went all the way -- it went -- literally, it went miles. So then I get back, and three weeks ago, ""Texas is in play. It's even."" And I say, that's bad news. Bad, I don't want to lose Texas. That's bad news. One little problem. One little problem. We're killing them in Texas. We're killing them. <APPLAUSE> A guy gets on two days ago, a man named Sid Miller. Don't really know him. Wearing a big, beautiful, white cowboy hat. In fact, I want to find out where he got it. It's pretty nice. And he said, ""You know, you folks are getting it all wrong. These lines are four, five, six blocks long. We've never had anything like this in Texas. And let me tell you, all those folks, they're all voting for Trump. They're not voting for anyone else."" <APPLAUSE> So, Texas, we're just absolutely -- we're doing great in Texas. But we're doing great in New Hampshire. We're doing great in Iowa. We're doing great in Ohio. Ohio. Just left, going back again soon. Doing phenomenally well in North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> I think we're going to win Pennsylvania. <APPLAUSE> I think we're going to win Pennsylvania. We're right there. I saw they had -- you know, and even is not, like, my thing. You know, we're even. But they had me way down in Pennsylvania, then last night, I'm looking, two or three polls came out. ""Jim, Trump is -- he's even now in Pennsylvania, too."" This is not -- you know, you can see the -- because they protect Hillary. I don't understand it. I don't understand why. <AUDIENCE BOOS> When this is all over with, I'm going to sit down with the dishonest media, I'm going to have an honest talk. Why? What is she going to do? She's -- she's a dishonest person. She has no energy. You know, you need energy to help this country. Like, for instance, I'm going to be doing five or six of these every day. You need energy here, folks. She goes home and she goes to sleep.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> You need a lot of energy, so we're going to be doing at least five of these today. The arenas are all packed all over the country. And we're going into different locations. We're going into what they used to call Democrat strongholds where we're now either tied or leading. We're going to Minnesota. <APPLAUSE> We're going up to Minnesota, which traditionally has not been Republican at all, and we're doing phenomenally. We just saw a poll. We're going to Colorado, where we're doing phenomenally well. We're doing well everywhere. We're doing well in places that they don't believe. They're saying, ""What's going on?"" Anyway, with Obamacare, getting back to the boring subject -- it's almost a waste of time talking about it, because when we terminate it, all we'll do is say it was a bad experience for the American people. You know. <APPLAUSE> Premiums are surging because of Obamacare. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting. And deductibles are going through the roof, some as high as $15,000, some higher than that. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even much more expensive. Going to make it much more expensive. <AUDIENCE BOOS> You know what they're going to do, her and Obama? They're going to show you -- and they don't care what it takes -- they're going to show you that it works. They're going to listen to Trump, never give up. OK? They're going to show you. OK, we don't want to be shown. I'll tell you what, it is catastrophic. I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and have health care for every family in Florida and great health care. Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. <APPLAUSE> As you know, the FBI -- and I give them a lot of credit, because they're fighting forces that they're not supposed to be fighting -- has reopened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> They're also conducting a second criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's pay-for-play corruption at the State Department. You see what's happening there. It has been confirmed that the 650,000 e-mails they discovered -- by accident -- can you believe it, 650,000 e-mails, oh, that's a treasure trove. That is going to be a lot of bad e-mails in there. They discovered it on Anthony Weiner's -- think of that -- can you imagine? Anthony Weiner has probably every classified e-mail ever sent. And knowing this guy, he probably studied every single one, in between using his machine for other purposes. <LAUGHTER> Including brand-new e-mails not previously turned over to authorities, likely including some very, very classified information. However, the reports also show that the political leadership at the Department of Justice is trying very hard and as hard as they can to protect their angel, Hillary. <AUDIENCE BOOS> Remember, Bill Clinton just happened when he was in Phoenix, Arizona -just happened to see her plane, the attorney general's plane. Oh, there's the attorney general. Oh, what a -- what an unbelievable -- he was going to play golf. It was about 110 degrees. He was going to play golf. Oh, I was going to play golf. Let me say hello. Hey, let's get together. Boom. I thought it was 39 minutes. Turned out to be 45 minutes. So went onto the plane on the tarmac, and right on the tarmac, and they had a meeting for 45 minutes, right before she was supposed to issue her judgment on Hillary and maybe Bill. Bill could be a target, who knows? Because of what's going on. So she met with him for 45 minutes. They discussed golf. That's about two minutes. They discussed grandchildren. Give them five. The rest of the time, what do you think they discussed? I would say, like, ""I hope you're going to be a part of our administration."" What do you think? What a disgrace. I'll tell you what, our country has never been in a situation like it's in right now. Never been. So dishonest. It's a rigged system, folks. I've been saying it. It's a rigged system, and it begins with the media, because the media rigs it. The media rigs it. <AUDIENCE BOOS> Did you see all those reports where The New York Times is sending them things, and they're saying, listen, we've got this reporter essentially, 100 percent, this is friendly stuff, where other reporters are sending them stories to check? Do you have any change? It's never happened to me. Man. I used to -- actually, I used to get good publicity until I decided to run. Now, I think I have -- and they even say -- actually, the Times said, one of the writers at the Times, said we don't care, we don't care if it's fair or not. It's so out of control, we don't care. It's the greatest pile-on in the history of politics, and that's OK. I used to be on the other side, don't forget. I did very well. But I also love our country, and it was time. It was time we had to do something. It was time. <APPLAUSE> But that's a big part, right there. A big part of the rigged system. Remember, John Podesta said Hillary Clinton has bad instincts, right? And I say to people, I'd fire him. If he was saying bad -- he says so many bad things about her, and he's her top person. He knows her well. And I don't want a president with bad instincts, and she does. All you have to do is look at her record. Bernie Sanders says that she's got bad judgment. Hillary created an illegal server to shield her criminal activity. That's why. There's no other reason. And then she -- and she figured she was above it, because she figured the Department of Justice will never do anything to get in her way, OK? It's a rigged system. The Department of Justice, if that happened to anybody else, they would have been in jail two years ago, folks, OK? What she did. Then she illegally destroyed -- and this is -- this is -- forget about what happened last Friday. I'm talking about the past. Forget about that -- that's all gravy, whatever happened. What she did in the past is so bad. She destroyed 30,000 -- remember this -- 33,000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena -- the key word being ""after"" -- and made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. Remember, if she ever got into the Oval Office, Hillary and her special interests and her donors would rob this country blind. I have no doubt about it. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take back our country from the special interests. <APPLAUSE> I want the entire, corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we -- we are about to say. When we win on November 8th, we are going to drain the swamp. Going to do it. <APPLAUSE> They're not happy, folks. They're not happy. There are a lot of unhappy people around. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs that have been stolen, stolen by either very stupid politicians or corrupt politicians, meaning special interests get them to do whatever they want them to do. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary. <AUDIENCE BOOS> America has lost 70,000 factories -- that's such a hard number to believe, 70,000 -- since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill- and Hillary-backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. There's never been a country that's lost jobs like we do, so stupidly, so easy to solve, so stupidly.
<AUDIENCE: I agree>
<TRUMP:> Goodrich Lighting Systems -- we will, I promise. I promise. <APPLAUSE> Goodrich Lighting Systems laid off 255 workers and moved their jobs to India. Baxter Health Care Corporation laid off 199 workers and moved their jobs to Singapore. Essilor Laboratories laid off 181 workers and moved their jobs, surprise, to Mexico. Tremendous, tremendous jobs, and it's worse -- it's getting worse and worse and worse. I mean, we have with some of these countries -- Mexico, in particular -- I have a great relationship with Mexico. I met with the Mexican president three months ago.
<AUDIENCE: Build a wall!>
<TRUMP:> Believe me. Oh, we'll build a wall. Don't even think about it. We'll build a wall. Don't worry about it. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!>
<TRUMP:> And you know what? The harder they fight us, the higher it goes, OK? I promise. <APPLAUSE> No, but I met with the president of Mexico. Look -- and he's a good guy, good guy. Good meeting, all of that. But -- look, we have a one-lane highway, goes right into Mexico. It takes our jobs, takes our money, takes our wealth, takes everything. We get unemployment and we get drugs. Not going to happen anymore, folks. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and will stop the jobs from leaving the great state of Florida, that I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> The theft of American prosperity will end quickly and effectively. If a company wants to fire their workers, leave Florida, move to another country, and then shift their product back into the United States, we will make them pay a tax of 35 percent. <APPLAUSE> OK? That it. Problem solved. Problem solved. Ninety-nine percent -- and you never heard this talk before. You know, they give them loans. ""Oh, we want you to stay."" They don't even talk to most of them. You know, most of them just leave. Nobody talks to them. We'll talk to them. And at first -- at first, we'll be very nice, right? First, we'll be very nice and respectful, and when they tell us, no, no, no, then we'll say, OK, here's the story, folks. Let's not be nice anymore. And you know what's going to happen with that tax? They're never going to leave this country. They're never leaving. He knows. They're never going to leave this country. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA. And if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers. <APPLAUSE> We will immediately stop the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, another disaster in the making that Hillary Clinton said is the gold standard. Yeah, it's the gold standard for other countries, not for us. The gold standard for the countries that want to be part of that deal. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're the highest taxed nation in the world, one of the main reasons that they're leaving. We will massively cut taxes for the middle class, also. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, don't hear it from me. Just look at it. Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes substantially. Highest taxed nation, she wants to raise taxes substantially. That's not going to happen. We will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations and use that money to invest in America. <APPLAUSE> That includes repairing so many of Florida's problems.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. We're going to repair so many of Florida's problems, and everyone's problems, including the Herbert Hoover dike, which is big problem, and the Florida aquifer. And we're going to protect the Everglades. We're going to do all of the things -- but we're going to have so much money left over, folks. You know what we want? You know what we want? We want really beautiful, clean air, right? We want really crystal, crystal clean water. And we want safety. We don't need to give hundreds of billions of dollars away -- we have no idea who's getting this money -- giving it to the United Nations. You know what that's called? Giving it to an open pit. You know how political the United -- can you imagine, as these guys are doling out that money, no, no, we're going to keep our money here and we're going to take care of our infrastructure, and we're going to take care of our environment, and we're going to lower taxes. <Applause.> We will also rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community has been treated terribly, terribly. That's why I'm so honored to see those signs. And I'm telling you, that's turning out to be the story of this election, the African-American vote. <APPLAUSE> Watch. You watch. They've been treated very unfairly. African-American and Hispanic people living in the inner cities -- there's no -- oh, you like that, Hispanics, huh? <APPLAUSE> How many Hispanics do we have here? <APPLAUSE> And, by the way, that's a big story. You know, as you know, the Cubans just endorsed me. They gave me the Bay of Pigs Association Award. <APPLAUSE> We'll be making a much different deal than they made with Castro. Believe me, folks. They're very happy. But that's another story that's turning out to be very big. The Hispanic vote is turning out to be much different than people thought. But the African-American community, the Hispanic community, folks living in the inner cities, crime-ridden -- you can't walk to the store and buy a loaf of bread, you get shot. The education is the worst. And there's no jobs. We're going to fix the education, we're going to bring back jobs, and we're going to bring back safety. And I say to the Hispanic community, living in the inner-city, to the African-American community, I say: What the hell do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it. I'm going to fix it. I am going to fix it. <APPLAUSE> You know, the Democrats have been running that whole thing for up to 100 years unbroken, and they come in, they say, ""We want your vote, we you're your vote."" And then you give them the vote -- you know this, fellas, right? You know that. They know. You give them their vote and they disappear for four years. They say, ""See ya, folks. See ya in four years."" And then they come back again and again. We have to show them it doesn't work that way anymore. And they'll never be able to do -- they'll never be able to do what I do. Look, I'm here -- I'm doing five or six of these a day. And Hillary goes home, she goes to sleep. If she wanted to do it, which she doesn't. She doesn't have the energy to do it, believe me. We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into this country... <AUDIENCE BOOS> ... over and above the thousands and thousands and thousands that are already coming in. Do you want to see a problem? This will be the great Trojan horse modern day version. Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend immediately the Syrian refugee program... <APPLAUSE> ... and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> You look at what's happened in France. You look at what's happened in Germany. No. And we all have big hearts. We'll build safe havens. We'll get the gulf states to put up the money. We owe -- you know, we owe -- what do we owe, $20 trillion? We owe $20 trillion. Think of it. But I'll get the gulf states -- they have plenty of money. They have so much money they don't know what to do with it. They just have to be told nicely, right? They're going to put up the money. We'll build safe havens in Syria, but we can't have this, folks. We have enough problems. We don't need these kind of problems. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. <APPLAUSE> And as we said, yes, we will build a great wall. <APPLAUSE> We received the first-ever endorsement issued by America's ICE and Border Patrol officers. It's just been reported that, as a result of our open borders, violent cartels have spread into all 50 states. More than 90 percent of those arrested are here illegally. Aren't you shocked? Ninety percent -- think of that -- 90 percent are here illegally.
<UNKNOWN: We love you, Trump.>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, darling. I love you, too. It's so nice. Oh, look, a future construction worker. Look. Look at that baby. He's so cute. Oh, give me that baby. <APPLAUSE> Future construction worker. <APPLAUSE> They did a great job. Wow. That is a great, beautiful baby. Congratulations. That's an early Trump fan, right? That's an early United States fan. Anyway, back to the basics. After going through that, I hate to say this, but these terrorists are killing innocent Americans, threatening schools, and destroying our communities. A government that will not protect its people is a government that is unworthy to lead. That's all. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminals to come into the country, go free, and wouldn't send them back to their home countries, and when they did, their home -- their home countries very, very intelligently said, ""We don't want them. Take them back, and we would never force them in."" I promise you, when we take these killers and gang members and drug lords back to their countries, they will be accepted gladly by their country, OK? Thank you so much for bringing this killer back, Mr. Trump. We totally appreciate it. They'll say, ""President Trump, thank you, sir. We very much like it. We're so, so happy. Mr. President, we are so, so happy to have our drug lords back, to have our killers back, to have our gang members back. Thank you, Mr. President, on behalf of"" -- I won't use the name of the country. Hillary supports total, open borders -- that means the end of your country -- and strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant and deported. This was a man deported probably more than five times. Thousands of Americans would be alive today if not for the open border policies of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. <AUDIENCE BOOS> And by the way -- and I've said it -- this guy is campaigning full-time. She can't campaign for herself. Nobody shows up to her meetings. The only way she gets them to show up is when she has a star come. That's the only way. Otherwise, she gets 500 people, 400 people, and by the way, the cameras never show that. Can you imagine if I had a small crowd? There would be headlines all over the world, ""Trump is not -- you know, is not doing it,"" right? But she has these little crowds show up. It's a big problem. Look, she can't do more than one or two a day because she has no energy, but she can't do it because they can't get any people. But Obama goes and campaigns for her. He ought to spend time in the Oval Office getting jobs, defeating ISIS, strengthening up our border. Among those killed, Americans like Josh Wilkerson, whose mother I've gotten to know during this campaign. Josh was a student in a high school, great student. He was murdered at the age of 17. He was tortured, strangled, and beaten to death by an illegal immigrant who should have never been in our country, and then his body was set on fire. You ought to look at the Remembrance Project. These people are amazing people. These are people that suffered so much. Last year, right here in Florida, 17-year-old Starlette Pitts, her boyfriend and her mother were viciously stabbed to death in their Lehigh Acres home by an illegal immigrant. The killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery, but he was released from custody, enabling him to commit these and other horrible crimes. And the people that knew him begged that he be incarcerated or begged that he be thrown the hell out of our country. And the Obama administration with their weak policies refused to listen. Death. A Trump administration will end this nightmare of violence. We will protect American lives. We will cancel all federal funding of sanctuary cities. <APPLAUSE> Very quickly. We will stop illegal immigration, deport every last criminal alien, and dismantle every criminal gang and cartel threatening our great citizens. <Applause.> When we win this election, you will finally have a government on your side fighting for your community and protecting your family. <APPLAUSE> We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. Greatest people on Earth. <APPLAUSE> That means brand-new modern aircraft from MacDill and -- we have to do this. Anybody -- MacDill? We're going to have beautiful, beautiful new -- you know, right now our fighter jets, some are so old they can't get parts, they don't make them anymore, 18, 19 years old. They did a big documentary about it. We're going to take care of those brand-new beautiful jets out of MacDill, OK? <APPLAUSE> I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. I actually heard we picked up about five today. And I want to thank the coach from getting up here and talking to you people. What a great coach. And Joe and your attorney general. You have so many great people. All the people that got up and spoke, I want to thank them. They're speaking all over the country. They're speaking all over the country. Hillary brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya, and she empowered Iran. They've been empowered. They've been emboldened. We gave them $150 billion. And they hate us. But now they're strong. We've created them. We've -- they were ready to die. They were ready to come back and make any deal we wanted. And we took them out of the ashes and we made them perhaps a world power, not just a regional power. All Hillary Clinton's thinking, bad judgment, bad instincts. And she unleashed ISIS all across the world. During the debates, did I win the debates? Did I win the debates? <APPLAUSE> You know, I was a little worried about the debate, because for a week and a half, I'd hear, ""She's not going out of her house. She's doing debate prep."" I said, wait a minute, how can you work that -- I mean, you're supposed to know this stuff, right? You know, I mean, she has a lot of experience. That's the one thing she has. She's got a lot of experience, but it's all bad experience. It's experience of losing. But she kept doing debate prep, right? And I felt guilty. I said, gee, I don't want to sit -- and what am I going to do in debate -- you mean 10 hours a day for a week-and-a-half? I can't do that. We're supposed to know the subject, aren't we? We're supposed to know the subject. Anyway, she did debate prep. I don't think it helped her very much. Hillary and her failed establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never win. By the way, we fight, we keep fighting. We fight, fight, fight. And I always say General Douglas MacArthur, General George Patton, what are they doing? They're spinning in their graves. They can't believe it. Mosul, we go into Mosul. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be attacking Mosul in four months from now. Oh. Now, the people of Mosul -- you know, these guys are tough and they're smart, in all fairness. So the ISIS -- one of the reasons we're going to Mosul is we want to get the ISIS leaders. We think they're staying in Mosul and we want to get them. Well, before the announcement is over, they've gone. Whatever happened to the element of surprise? The element of surprise? What a group of losers we have. And now it's a very tough battle. They're dug in. It's a very -- much tougher than they thought. Much tougher than they thought. No, we need different thinking in this country, folks. They should have kept their mouths shut, quietly, quickly, and viciously go in, and then have a news conference when it's over a week later. Right? And I'm convinced they only did that for political reasons. They thought it was going to be a great, quick victory. It wasn't. It's a disaster. They thought it was going to be a quick victory. And you know, Hillary is running and then she'll get credit. Oh, she's -- she's -- except for one problem. We already had Mosul. So we gave it up because of the way they got out, and then ISIS was formed. ISIS is now in 32 countries. But during the debate, I watched, and she's saying, we're going to fix our tax code. Well, why didn't you do it? Because all of her people do the same thing. We're all doing the same thing. And we're going to fix our tax code. We're going to do this. We're going to do that. We're going to fix this. And I kept saying, you've been there for 30 years. Why didn't you do it? It will never happen. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, shipped our goods and our wealth and our companies to other countries. And they've left our borders wide open. So we have no borders. And yet we're over fighting for countries that a lot of people in this room have never heard of. And we want a border. We're fighting so they have a border, but we don't protect our own border. That will change on November 8th. <APPLAUSE> A Trump administration will never, ever put the interests of a foreign country before the interest of our country. <APPLAUSE> From now on, it's going to be America first. To all Americans, I say, it is time for change. It is time for new leadership. <APPLAUSE> And in closing, I want you to think about...
<AUDIENCE: We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, folks. I just see a sign that I love. Let me see that. Let me see that. Let me see that. Yeah, let me have that. Let me have that. Let me have it. I love that sign. It's true. I love that sign. I love all the signs. Women for Trump, blacks for Trump, Hispanics for Trump. Thank you. I just found a second mike. I'm probably being wired or tapped here. That's got to be the Justice Department doing that. Saying, where does this mike -- I'm saying to myself, where the hell did the second mike come from? Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, even bigger. She's going to raise your taxes. We will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. Such a big thing. Such a big thing. Cancel every illegal Obama executive order. We are going to protect religious liberty. We will rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans like they've never been taken care of before. They've been badly treated. It won't happen. We already have a plan for the veterans, and they love it, and we have overwhelming support from the veterans, our great people. We don't take care of them. We will provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We'll bring our education local. <APPLAUSE> We will support the men and women of law enforcement. We are going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege. We have the endorsement of the NRA, National Rifle Association. And I have to tell you, these are great people -- Wayne and Chris and all of them -- they love this country. They love this country. They gave me the earliest endorsement they've ever given to a presidential candidate. We're going to save our Second Amendment. Great people. And we will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> And it's time to cut our ties with the failed politicians -- like Hillary -- of the past. Hillary Clinton is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. <APPLAUSE> And they've never seen a movement like this, folks. They've never, ever seen a movement like this. There has never been anything like this in this country's history. And we have to close it out on November 8th or sooner. By the way, who's voted? <APPLAUSE> All right, that's about 80 percent. Twenty percent, leave right now. Vote. OK. Just before the 8th. The numbers are looking good, that I can tell you. Did you guys vote? Did you vote? <APPLAUSE> Blacks for Trump, you voted, right? Good. Good. Thank you. We are fighting for every parent who lost their child to drugs and crime and gang violence. We are fighting for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out of our country and shipped to other faraway lands. It's happening all the time. And we are fighting for every American who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. I'm asking you to dream big, because your vote -- think of this -- we are just three days away, do you believe it? Three days away. We'll bring about the change you've been waiting for your entire life. This will be a very important day. And I know that the vote that you cast will be the most important vote of your life, because our country doesn't win anymore. We will start winning. We will knock out ISIS. Believe me, we have no choice. We will knock them out. We will knock out ISIS. We will win at trade. We will win at the borders. We will start winning again. We'll win so much, you're going to get sick and tired of winning. Is that possible? You'll say, ""Please, Mr. President, you're winning too much. Let's take it easy."" We are going to win so much, you're going to be so proud of your country, and hopefully you're going to be proud of your president. <APPLAUSE> Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Get out and vote. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Get out and vote.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-05"">
<TRUMP:> Wow! What a great room. On quick notice -- on quick notice, we didn't bring any so-called -- so-called ""stars"" along. We didn't need them. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> You know, the reason Hillary has to do that is nobody comes for her deal. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> She can't fill a room. We can get stars. We don't need them because we just want to make America great again and we know what to do, right? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We don't need that. That's almost like a form of cheating, right? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> That's like when she got the questions from Donna Brazile to the debate, right? <CROWD REACTS> And she didn't report it. She went into the debate. Isn't that amazing, by the way? That took place and not one of the dishonest crooked media mentioned that. Nobody mentions it. <CROWD REACTS> Nobody mentions it. They go after Donna Brazile -- who cares -- but nobody says, ""Wait a minute, she got the questions. She went into the debate."" Nobody says anything. Why didn't she reported to Ethics or to somebody? You know why, because she is crooked Hillary, that's why, folks. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> In three days, we are going to win... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...the great state of Nevada... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...and we are going to win back the White House. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We need you all to go and vote on Tuesday and bring your friends and family to those polls. We're going to have a big, big victory. They didn't get the kind of vote that they needed to stop us on Tuesday. You know what that means, right? They didn't get the numbers they were looking for. You're going to have a big, big day. Tuesday is our day in the state, so... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...Tuesday, so you got to get out there. We'll never have this opportunity again, not going to happen again. Reno and Northern Nevada can carry this state and can carry us all the way to Washington and the White House. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> This will be our last chance, but don't let crazy, broken Harry Reid and his corrupt political machine... <CROWD REACTS> ...decide this election for you -- crazy Harry. Remember he said four years ago that he found out with surety that Romney didn't pay tax and called him also lots of names, remember? And then it turned out he did pay tax, but the election was over, and they said -- ""But you lied,"" he said, ""We won, didn't we?"" You know, I was right about that, but that's a political hack. For instance, it's being reported that certain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring Democratic voters in. <CROWD REACTS> Folks, it's a rigged system, it's a rigged system and we're going to beat it. We're going to beat it. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I've been saying it's a rigged system. Obama who does nothing but campaign for Hillary because she can't campaign for herself, he's out there and he said, ""Donald Trump is hurting the foundations of our country by talking about rigging the election."" Excuse me, eight years ago he was talking about Chicago and how they rigged the votes, OK? This guy give -- you know what I say to President Obama, ""Give me a break."" <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Phony <ph>. And it's up to the great people of Washoe County to get it done, get it done. You got to get it done. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> You are the people, you're going to get it done. And don't forget, in this state, I've spent hundreds of millions of dollars building things. We have great success in this state. I have great, great employees. So I feel I have an awfully big state. I come here all the time. I love it. But to do that and to win, you have to get every single person that you know to the polls with you. You have to vote with your heart and I know you're going to do that. You have to vote with your soul to make America great again. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Real change means restoring honesty to our government. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Thank you everybody, thank you. Boy, a lot -- a lot of spirit in this room, huh? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> A lot of spirit, a lot of spirit. The place is great. The people here are great. The people in this state, from day one, first time I came here many, many years ago, the people in this state are amazing, so great. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> The state is going to have a very big impact or the outcome of our country -- forget the election -- on the outcome of our country, because if we win on Tuesday, our country is going to start winning again. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're going to start winning again. We don't win anymore. As you know, the FBI has reopened its criminal investigation... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...into Hillary Clinton, following the discovery of another 650,000 emails, probably including the 33,000 emails that Hillary destroyed after receiving a congressional subpoena. <CROWD REACTS> They are also... <CROWD CHANTING> Folks, folks, folks, she shouldn't be allowed to run. OK? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And I'm not talking about what happened last Friday, I'm talking about right now. She shouldn't be allowed to run. When you look at General Cartwright, four-star general, for doing almost nothing by comparison, could serve five years in jail. That happened two weeks ago. General Petraeus destroyed their lives for doing nothing by comparison. How about the young man took pictures of his submarine? He wanted to have some pictures. The submarine is not like it's a brand new submarine; it's many years old. They put them in jail for a year, and she does all of these different things. They're also conducting a second criminal investigation into Hillary's illegal pay-for-play corruption at the State Department. <CROWD REACTS> There's virtually no doubt that FBI Director Comey and the great, great special agents of the FBI will be able to collect more than enough evidence to garner indictments against Hillary Clinton and her inner circle despite her efforts to disparage them and to discredit them. If she were to win this election, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. In that situation, we could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial. <CROWD REACTS> It would grind government to a halt, of course, that's what we have right now under Obama anyway. We need a government that can work and work well from day one for the American people. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> That will be impossible with Hillary Clinton, the prime suspect in a massive far-reaching criminal investigation. Her current scandals and controversies will continue throughout her presence and will make it virtually impossible for her to govern or lead our country. Now I don't think it's going to matter because she's not going to win, but we'll -- let's... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...let's go through the scenario. <CROWD CHANTING> By the way, does anybody speak better about this subject than our legendary mayor Rudy Giuliani? Does anybody? Huh? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> He's the greatest. <CROWD CHANTING> Come here. Special guy. New York was crime-infested, filthy, dirty problems all over the place. Rudy came in. He straightened it out... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...straightened it out. Thank you, Rudy, for everything. If she ever got into the Oval Office, Hillary and her special interests would rob our country blind. You see what's going on? <CROWD REACTS> At the heart of this election is one simple question, will our country be governed by the people or by the corrupt political class? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> If we win, the corrupt politicians and her special interests will lose. If they win, the American will lose. It's just that simple. The political elites in this country have used their power to enrich themselves at your expense. They have run the government for their benefit and they've profited from your pain. You see what's happening. And by the way, folks, you're highly sophisticated. And I always say I have the smartest people, smartest... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...the smartest. And I have the most loyal people... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...by far, and that's borne out in every poll they take. In fact, they are very worried, you know, with all the polls that are happening. We're winning all over the place. We're winning in Iowa. It just came out, we're seven points up. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're winning in Ohio. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're winning in New Hampshire. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're winning in North Carolina. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I think we're going to win the great state of Pennsylvania. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Based on turnout, I think we're going to win Florida. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And you know where else we're going to win? Right here. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> So this is the choice on Tuesday, either we will have a government run by the donors and the special interests who control everything and control crooked Hillary Clinton... <CROWD REACTS> ...or we will have a government run by you, the American people. That's what we're doing. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> <CROWD CHANTING> There has never been a movement like this in the history of the United States. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And you know I couldn't say that if it weren't true because of these very, very dishonest reporters back there in the media. <CROWD REACTS> They would call us out for that. There's never been a movement like this, never been the crowds which they never show, by the way, they never show. This was set-up so recently and look at all the people. There's never been the crowds. There's never been the enthusiasm, and there's never been the loyalty that we have, never been in this country. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And someday they'll start reporting it correctly, but I almost think it doesn't matter because we get it, we get it. Total dishonesty. And while they are there, show the cameras, show the crowds, fellas. Go ahead, show the crowd, show the crowd. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Go ahead. Show the crowd. Spread those cameras. They never like <inaudible>. The only time they do it is where there's a protester because that's a negative thing. It turned out that the protesters we used to have were bought for $1,500 a piece, and they were told to go in and incite riots. <CROWD REACTS> And they cover the protesters. But last night, Obama had a protester... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...and nobody would listen to him. He kept saying the same thing over and over -- nasty -- over and over and over. But they never showed the protester with him because that's a negative thing. They just kept it on him, but it was a pretty bad scene. Let me tell you the way he acted. If you want a government that will secure your borders, stop the massive inflow of refugees... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...lower your taxes, bring back your jobs... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...grow your economy and protect your family always. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Vote for Donald J. Trump. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Tuesday, that's going to be a big day. Thank you, everybody. What a crowd. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> What people, what people. Greatest people in the world. I'll tell you, folks, this country all over, no matter where we go, no matter where we go, we were in Hershey, Pennsylvania, the other night, unbelievable. We did numerous -- all over North Carolina, unbelievable. No matter where we go -- Florida, Texas. Remember last week, they were reporting Texas is in play -- Texas. Texas is in play, you know, like that was bad because she was supposed to win Texas easily. I said, ""I'm surprised Texas is in play because I was there, we have this massive crowds."" Actually, Rudy was there. We had a line that must have been two miles long, getting in, and that's because the place was small. Those were the people that didn't get in and so I said, ""I'm surprised."" Two weeks <inaudible>, Texas is in play, unfortunately, that turned out to be a lie also, the media. <CROWD REACTS> Maybe they meant -- maybe they meant Texas is in play for Trump, I guess, because... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...the great state, great state of Texas. So, a man calls up, good guy, <inaudible> he calls up one of the <inaudible>. He said, ""Yeah, I've been hearing for three to four weeks Texas is in play."" Well, we have the longest lines I've ever seen and most of those people have ""Trump"" on their shirt, and they have Trump buttons and Trump hats. And to the best of my knowledge, they will not be voting for Hillary Clinton. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> So, as soon as the media looked at this record-setting vote, they took Texas is in play out of their vocabulary. These are really dishonest people. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take your country back from the special interests. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And I used to be on the other side until June 16th of last year. I went from being an insider. Boy, did I become an outsider fast? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Well, that was the quickest outsider. But you know what, I love this country. I saw what was happening. It was going bad. We were really going bad. If you look at the Iran deal, $150 billion, look at a deal where we give these guys the number one terror nation, we give them $1.7 billion in cash -- cash... <CROWD REACTS> ...for hostages, which was a lie when he said it was <inaudible>. Remember it was supposed to be $400 million. Think of this, $400 million in cash, but that turned out to be wrong. It was $1.7 billion. You know what, $1.7 billion in cash, you could fill up that whole side of this big arena. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words of all of us. When we win on November 8th, we are going to drain the swamp. <CROWD REACTS> <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> <CROWD CHANTING> We're going to do it. We're going to bring in the right people. We're going to really turn things around. This is ridiculous what's going on. Real change also begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> You know I shouldn't tell you this, you've probably seen it, but I always use your state as the example for the premiums going up. You know why? We think you have the highest in the country. I don't want to tell you that. I don't want to tell you that. But I always use your state. They're all going up through, but you have the highest. You're going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike. The great state, right, the great state that you live in is going up numbers I will not tell you. In Arizona -- I'll give you an example -- they're going up 116 percent. <CROWD REACTS> Ten of Nevada's 16 counties will have only one Obamacare exchange insurer to choose from next year. Good luck with that negotiation. Good luck with that negotiation. Good luck. And your numbers are going to be really high, but I'm not going to depress you, but I know what they are. I want you to be happy when you leave, but actually you will because we're going to get rid of Obamacare anyway, so you're not going to have to pay. Don't bother. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're going to have great health care at much less cost and it's going to be much better. What's going on with Obamacare is -- never had a chance to work. And I said it before they even submitted it for a vote, and then Obama started lying that you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor. He said it 28 different times. And in all fairness, even the Democrats that weren't going to vote for it got swayed by him. They wished they didn't do it now, I will tell you. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting, and deductibles are through the roof. You have deductibles, sometimes $15,000. Yet, Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. <CROWD REACTS> I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Nevada... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...and for every family in this country. At the core of my contract is my plan -- so important -- to bring back your jobs. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> America has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. <CROWD REACTS> America has lost 70,000 factories -- can you believe that number? I always thought it was a mistake. I've been saying that number now for two weeks, I can't believe it -- 70,000. I always think maybe 700, maybe 7,000 -- 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. <CROWD REACTS> We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Nobody has ever stolen jobs like other countries have taken them from us. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America so easily, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Nevada. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> The theft of American prosperity will end and it will end immediately. We will renegotiate NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers and our companies. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will also immediately stop the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Hillary Clinton lied in the debate. By the way, did I win those debates please? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Thank you. She kept saying she's in debate prep -- for weeks, she was in debate prep. I kept saying, you know, I felt guilty. I said there must be something to this debate prep. She just didn't want to go out campaigning. It was a good excuse. I mean, when you're doing this -- she's doing it for 30 years, right? More. I always say you've been doing it for so long, if you want to change the tax code, why didn't you do it? You want to fight ISIS, why didn't you do it? I mean, she created ISIS really. It came out of the vacuum. Now, ISIS is in 32 countries. She won't do anything with ISIS. But why don't you fix the things you want to fix? You talk about it, why don't you do it? You want to bring back jobs, bring back jobs. In New York State, she said she was going to bring back jobs. Upstate New York, it became a total disaster. Everyone left. You have to see it today. Greatest people, but you have to see what happened to Upstate New York. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We are going to massively cut taxes for the middle class, the forgotten people. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And we will rebuild our inner cities, which are absolutely a shame. Watch out. And for the African-American community and for the Latino community... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...remember this, the inner cities -- so unfair -- the Democrats have run them for over 100 years, in many cases, unbroken. And every four years they come in and ask for your vote -- we want your vote. And after you give them the vote and they win an election, they say, ""See you in four years."" They don't do anything. The crime is horrible. You can't walk to a store and get a loaf of bread without being shot, in many cases. You see what's happening. The crime is horrible. The education is practically non- existent. It's so bad and jobs are gone. There are no jobs. And I say, we're going to fix the crime. We're going to fix the education. We're going to bring back jobs. We are going to rebuild the inner cities. And the African -- it's true, it's not <inaudible> going to be hard. There were such potential. We have such incredible potential in our inner cities. We're going to fix our inner cities. And the African-American community, the Latino community, you're going to be so thankful you're going to love it. And I say to you and I say this because the Democrats have let you down for decades and decades and decades, I say to you what the hell do you have to lose, right? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> What do you have to lose? I will fix it. We are going to fix the inner cities. We're going to bring back jobs. We're going to make them safe. There's straighten out education. We will become a rich nation once again, but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our country. <CROWD REACTS> Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and into your communities. <CROWD REACTS> When I'm elected president, if you vote, otherwise it's not going to work out, you got to vote. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will suspend the Syrian refugee program... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country... <Off-mic> <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We got no choice -- we got no choice. <CROWD CHANTING> Thank you. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And yes, we will build a wall. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will build a wall. It'll be a great wall, and it have big doors in it, and people will come through those doors but they'll come through those doors legally. We want people to come in legally. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And we'll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and destroying our youth and poisoning all -- so many people, so many people. We're going to stop the drugs from pouring in, believe me. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries very intelligently would not take them back. They didn't want murders. They didn't want gang members. They didn't want drug lords, but I promise you this, when we bring them back to their countries, not once -- not once will they ever come back to us in this life <ph>, not once. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Hillary supports totally open borders -- there goes your country and strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered... <CROWD REACTS> ...by an illegal immigrant deported more than five times. Thousands of Americans would be alive today if not for the open border policies of Obama and Clinton. On Mother's Day in 2009, Carson City-born 17-year-old Rene Angulo was out driving looking for a job when he was shot in the head and brutally murdered by a previously deported illegal immigrant gang member, who everybody that knew this gang member said, ""Please get him out of the country. Please put him in prison. He must be incarcerated."" Rene was pulled from his vehicle and left to die on the side of a road. A good Samaritan who thought there had been a car accident stopped to help and was violently shot. The illegal immigrant killer had a previous conviction involving murder in Carson City, but was released and allowed to roam free and did further damage after that. <CROWD REACTS> Other story after story, we could go for days and days and days, this story after story one worse than the other. A Trump administration will end this nightmare of violence. We will protect American lives. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will stop illegal immigration. And by the way, I have tremendous support within the Hispanic-Latino community -- tremendous... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...because they came here -- they came here legally. They want to see borders. They have their jobs, which are great jobs. They have their homes. They want to keep their homes. They want to keep their jobs. They want other members of their families to come into our country and they will come in. They will come into our country. We're going to have other members of your families come in. They'll go through a process, and it won't be a process like you have now where people wait 10 and 12 years before they get in. We'll have a streamlined beautiful process. It will be efficient. It will be efficient, not the way it is now. So we've had this tremendous outpouring of love from the Hispanic community. A certain radio station in New York said the owner of the station was in another show, and it's all Spanish, and he was being interviewed. And he said, ""You know, I don't know about this whole thing with Trump because everybody that calls us -- every single person is in favor -- is in favor of Trump, so we're going to have tremendous -- I think we're going to have tremendous Hispanic-Latino support on Tuesday, tremendous. I think it's going to be tremendous. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We have one of those guys from -- from the Hillary Clinton campaign. <CROWD REACTS> How much are you being paid, $1,500? All right. Take him out. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> When we win the election on Tuesday, you will finally have a government on your side fighting for your community and protecting your family. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> By the way, folks, while we're at it, great... <COMMOTION HAPPENS> <CROWD REACTS> <CROWD CHANTING>
<UNKNOWN: Hey... (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ...nobody is going to stop this movement, nobody. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Your next president of the United States will be back in a couple of minutes, so hang tight. We love you Trump Train. Let's go. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> ...very much. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Thank you. Nobody said it was going to be easy for us... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...but we will never be stopped, never ever be stopped. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people. So let's get back to repealing the defense sequester. Right now it doesn't sound that exciting, but it's very important because we're going to rebuild our badly depleted military. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> That means brand new modern aircraft for naval air station, and you know what I'm talking -- Fallon, who's Fallon? Any? <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Not far from here, the naval air station. We have aircraft that's 18 and 20 years old. We have aircraft much older than that. We can't even buy parts to some of our aircraft. They're so old, they don't make the parts anymore. I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Now see those Medal of Honor recipients, when they saw that scene over there, they would have brushed off the Secret Service and they would have jumped in. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> They're incredible people, but we have now many, many more coming also to endorse the whole -- the whole campaign. It's been a beautiful thing. Hillary Clinton brought death -- I love you, too -- and disaster. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And I want to thank all of these people, wow! You were amazing. Thank you, fellas. I saw what you are doing. That's a tough group of people right here. Thank you. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Thank you. It's really great. I saw that. That was pretty amazing. Nobody messes with our people, right? Nobody. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> She brought death and disaster to Iraq, and Syria and Libya, and she empowered Iran and she unleashed ISIS across the world. She created a vacuum and ISIS was formed. Now she is saying she's going to get rid of it. She has no chance of getting rid of ISIS. We are going to get -- we get rid of it fast. And when we go in to do something, we don't announce it four months before we do it like Mosul. We don't announce that we're going into Mosul to get the leaders who leave about two minutes after they hear the first announcement. Now we're going to do things right, folks. Hillary and her failed establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now the Middle East is in worse shape than it's ever been by a factor of 10. They have dragged us into foreign wars that make us less safe. They shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries, and they've left our borders wide open at home. We send our troops to foreign countries to defend their borders, but our politicians refuse to defend our borders. Figure that one out. <CROWD REACTS> That will change on November 8th. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> A Trump administration will never ever put the interest of a foreign country before the interest of our country. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> From now on, it's going to be America first. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> To all Americans I say it's time for change, it's time for real leadership. We'll have real leadership. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Just in finishing up, I want you to think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of the Trump administration. We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...and she is going to raise your taxes substantially. We will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will cancel every illegal Obama executive order. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will protect religious liberty -- have to do it. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Rebuild our military, and we are going to take care for once and for all of our great, great veterans... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...for once and for all. They've been treated very badly. We will provide school choice and put an end to common core. We're bringing education local... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...and support the great men and women of law enforcement. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> Great people, amazing people. We're going to save our second amendment, which is under siege... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...so important. We have the NRA total endorsement, earliest endorsement they have ever given, and appoint justices to the Supreme Court of the United States who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> It's time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past. Hillary Clinton is the candidate of yesterday. Folks, she's been doing this for 30 years and it's only bad. We are the movement of the future. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're fighting for every parent who lost their child to drugs and crime and gang -- right, right? And gang violence, so much gang violence. We're fighting for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries. No more, no more, no more. And we're fighting for every American who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> I'm asking you to dream big because with your vote, we are just -- can you believe this? Three days away from the change... <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> ...you've been waiting for your entire life. Amazing. You're going to remember this day and you're going to remember this evening, and you're going to remember the vote that you cast whether you've casted or whether you will be casting it, and you're going to say it was the single greatest vote you ever have cast because that's when your country started winning again. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We're going to win with trade. We're going to win on the border. We're going to win the war on drugs. We're going to knock the hell out of ISIS. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We have no choice. We're going to win so much you're going to get tired of winning, you're going to say, you know, this guy is winning too much because you're not used to winning because we never win. We don't win with war, we don't win with trade, we don't win on the borders. You're going to win so much you're going to love it. Get out and vote. Get out and vote, because together we will make America wealthy again. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will make America strong again. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> We will make America safe again. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> And we will make America great again. <CHEERING AND APPLAUSE> God bless you.

<date:""2016-11-06"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. Thank you. Special place, special people. Thank you. So we really weren't supposed to be here. We weren't going to come back to Iowa. They said, Mr. Trump, you don't have to, you're leading by so much you don't have to. I said, what do you mean I don't have to? I want to go to Iowa which is true. I want to go to Iowa. And the incredible leadership that you have in this state unbelievable. So I just want to begin by thanking Iowa leaders here today, Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds. Where is Kim? Come on up Kim, come on, come on Kim; a man that I've gotten to know very well over the years and somebody that's respected outside of Iowa like you wouldn't believe, inside of Iowa so much that he's the longest serving Governor in the history of the United States, Terry Branstad. By the way, Terry came to my office and he was talking to me about trade. I think there's nobody that knows more about trade than him. He's one of the ones in dealing with China where you would be our prime candidate to take care of China. He has done so well, so well, for the people of Iowa nobody knows it better. Congressman Steve King great guy, great guy. I even like him when he was endorsing Ted. He was endorsing Ted and I still liked him. So Steve; he came around; it took him a little while but he came around. Thank you very much, Steve. And a woman who I got to know because as you know she was on a very short list and she loves the people of Iowa and she felt she needed a little it wasn't me; it wasn't me she felt she needed a little more seasoning maybe and I said isn't that refreshing when you hear that from somebody and she is now seasoned because there's nobody that does a better job representing their people than Joni Ernst and a great person Joni come on up. Thank you very much incredible people. Whenever they run just keep voting. You have to always vote for them. If it's in two years or four years or 20 years, you're never going to do better than them. In two days, can you believe this, we are going to win the great state of Iowa and we are going to win back the White House and I want to thank the people of Iowa. You have opened up your hearts to me so much, incredible it's been just incredible; our evening here the other night with the fireworks. Everything is always beautiful in Iowa. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare, a disaster, right. They're all saying, yes please. It's just been announced that the residents of Iowa are going to have and experience a massive double digit premium hike. Like I know the number; I will not tell you I never do this with any of the groups; I don't say the number because it's so depressing. Right now, everyone is happy; we're having a good time even though the subject matter is difficult but we're going to make it great. But I will say this: the Obamacare is out of control. In the great state of Arizona, premiums are going up more than 116%. I just left Arizona and they are very unhappy with what's going on. Over half of the counties in Iowa are losing Obamacare insurers next year, tough to negotiate. It's honestly not going to matter because we're going to have it terminated by then so we win. We'll have it terminated so we won't have any problems, Governor, OK. We'll terminate it; it'll be gone; it'll be just a bad memory. Premiums are surging. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof. You have deductibles at 15, 16, $17,000 can you believe it? Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive, far more expensive. I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Iowa and for every family in our great country so important. Just remember, Obamacare, got to get rid of it. Real change means restoring honesty to our government. There is little doubt that FBI Director Comey and the great special agents within the FBI will be able to collect more than enough evidence to garner indictments against Hillary Clinton and her inner circle despite her effort to disparage and discredit the FBI. If she were to win it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. In that situation we could very well have a sitting President under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial. Just today we learned Hillary Clinton was sending highly classified information through her maid did you see; it just came out a little while ago who therefore had total access to this information completely jeopardizing the national security of the United States. This just came out Wiki Leaks. We need a government that can go to work on day one for the American people. That will be impossible with Hillary Clinton, the prime suspect in a far-reaching criminal investigation. Her current scandals and controversies will continue throughout her presidency and will make it virtually impossible for her to govern. Let's hope we don't have to think about it. If she ever got into the Oval Office, Hillary and her special interests would rob our country blind that's what she has been doing. At the heart of this election is a simple question: will our country be governed by the people or will it be governed by the corrupt political class? We're going to find out very soon. If we win the corrupt politicians and their special interests lose. If we win the American people and you understand that if we win, what's going to happen to the American people? If we win you're going to be so happy because if we win our country is going to start winning again. We don't win anymore. Our country is going to start winning again; it's just that simple. Speaking in a secret Wall Street meeting, Hillary Clinton admitted that she wants to cut Medicare and Social Security. Hillary Clinton is going to destroy your Social Security and Medicare. She even wants to give your benefits to illegal immigrants and you've seen that all over. I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare. You made a deal a long time ago, a long time ago. And I will protect American workers. The political and media elite have no idea what it's like to be living on a paycheck, paycheck-to-paycheck basis, not knowing whether or not the owners and leaders of their company are negotiating to move their plant or factory to Mexico or some other country and fire them sometimes with virtually no notice. It's happening all over the country. It's not going to happen with us folks, not going to happen with us. Politicians don't understand what that's like. The media and the political elite don't know the pain and the suffering these people are living under. But I figured it out a long time ago and that's why I'm here, I'm with you, rather than where I was. I was on the other side. I was on the other side. I understand it well. I understand the other side well. I was enjoying my life for many years on the other side but I also love our country and I will tell you, our country was going bad; our country was going not only in the wrong direction; our country was going bad. And on June 16th of last year, I went from being a true insider to perhaps the ultimate outside ever, ever. I don't know; I think so, right. What do you think, Kim? I think so, pretty much, huh? These people that I've known all my life; they're saying, Donald, what happened? We are going to make America great again - that's what happened. You are the people that built our country and we are going to give you the respect that you deserve. Hillary is an insider fighting only for herself and her special interests. I'm an outsider. I've become an outsider fighting for you. I'm not a politician. You, the American people, are my only special interest. That's what I'm doing it for; that's what I'm doing it for. And it's a lot of work, folks, I will tell you. It's a lot more work than I ever thought but it is a movement in this country the likes of which our country has ever seen, Even the extremely dishonest media back there; they will say there is no there has never been anything like this. This is far bigger than Bernie Sanders. That was a smar...and by the way many of his people believe it or not are coming to our side because they agree with me on trade. They realize how we're being ripped apart on trade. And he should've never made a deal. He told his soul to the devil when he made that deal. He ruined his legacy. But many of the Bernie people are coming over to us because of trade. And our stance on trade is tougher and smarter and better than his but they understand that and they're coming over. The media, Wall Street and the politicians are trying to stop us because they know we will fix the rigged system that has enriched them for so many years but very much at your expense very, very much. I've spent a life in business creating tens of thousands of jobs. I built a great, great company, but I've spent a whole life I've employed tens of thousands of Americans but when I saw what was happening to our country, I just felt I had to act; I had to act and I acted I acted. So that's when I made my move and that's the way the move is. That's when we made our move. Thank you very much. June 16th famous day, right? Do you remember coming down the escalators, oh boy, but I don't mind being an insider, I don't mind. This is our last chance folks. I think the Governor would agree with me so much. We have one chance; it's our last chance; it's on Tuesday; it's the 8th it's our last chance. Now some of you have voted. How many of you have voted? It's not so...actually I like it because our numbers are looking very good but I know we're going to get a lot more people. Tuesday is going to be a very good day. But this...this is our last chance because, and I'm talking as a country, because it's never going to happen again. And I was sort of saying it last time, but his time I say it and we have so many things to do and we can do them some of them easily; some of it is common sense. There's no common sense. The Iran deal $150 billion going back to Iran and then we're going to give them $400 million in cash, right? But the $400 million turned out to be $1.7 billion. Terry is looking at me saying, that's not possible, $1.7 billion? $1.7 billion we could use that and we could do a hell of a job in Iowa with $1.7. That's in...Terry, that's in green that's cash. That would go up to the ceiling, $1.7 billion in cash. And Obama lied; he said it wasn't for hostages but they wouldn't let the hostages go until the money came in so many lied; lied on Obamacare. You can have your doctor; you can have your plan 28 different times; you can have your doctor; you can have your plan. Many Democrats who didn't want to approve it approved it based on that lie because it just made it unfortunately, it just made it. But going out and voting, it's your last chance; it's your last chance to make our country truly, truly, truly great again we have such potential. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take back our country from the special interests. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment, other than our great Congressman over here; he's not corrupt; where's our Congressman I'm not talking about you Congressman and I'm not talking about everybody but boy there are a lot of them. To hear words we are all about to say when we win on November 8th we are going to drain the swamp. That was an expression I tell people. I thought it was hokey; I thought that was so hokey, I said no way I'm ever saying that. And then I went before a big group like this and by the way this room is packed and there are thousands of people outside that can't get in which is amazing. But I gave that expression at a speech and I go like, very timidly, drain the swamp. The place like really liked it. Then I said it with more energy the next time and they really liked it. And then a third time they really, really...and then now people are going crazy and they're screaming at me when I'm speaking drain the swamp, drain it. Between that and build the wall, these are two expressions, right. And we will build a wall. So you never know about things, right? I tell the story of Frank Sinatra. Frank Sinatra didn't like ""My Way"", the song ""My Way""; great song. He didn't like it and then he sang it, the audience loved it; he sang it again; the audience really loved it. Then it went out and became the number one song. All of the sudden he loved it, right he loved it. It became his favorite song just about. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring jobs back to our country and to Iowa. We're going to bring our jobs back. Our economy's growth is anemic the worst since the Great Depression, you don't hear that. My jobs plan begins with a proposal to lower taxes on American business from 35% to 15% and that's a massive tax cut for the family farms and the folks in Iowa that work so hard and end up with very little left after taxes. And we're going to further protect our family farmers. We're going to protect them like they have never been protected before, I mean honestly, or I would have one big enemy in Terry, that I can tell you. And we're going to protect corn-based ethanol. Hillary Clinton's plan will shut down family farms all over the nation just like closed up the mines well let me tell you, the miners are going back to work and the steel workers are going back to work. We're going to have clean coal but miners are going back to work. She will do this not only through radical EPA regulation but also by raising taxes to rates as high as almost 50%. Hillary also wants to substantially increase the death tax on family farms. You know you have a farm; it would be nice to leave it to your children, right. It's tough, tough we're going to get rid of that. On top of that, her anti-energy agenda will radically up drive up the costs of energy, another attack on agriculture big, big attack on agriculture. We will reverse the Obama/Clinton EPA intrusion and eliminate job-killing regulations that hurt the people of Iowa and really hurt the farms. You know the one thing and I was telling the Governor, your Governor the last time we're giving massive...we're the highest-taxed nation in the world and we're giving massive tax cuts but we're also cutting very substantially the regulations. And we want clean air; we want clean water and we want safety. But beyond that, but I was just saying we are...you know you look at all of the different things; the thing that they most want, people, are the cut in regulations, even more important to them, more important than the massive tax cuts are the cuts in regulations. Because they have killed our businesses; they're killing our businesses, especially our small businesses and I would've been surprised and I was surprised. [AUDIO CUTS OUT] [JOINED IN PROGRESS]...Syrian refugees pouring into our country and that's over the thousands and thousands that Obama has allowed. You know he should go to the Oval Office and he should work on jobs; he should work on knocking the hell out of ISIS, rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% [AUDIO CUTS OUT] ...to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. We have no choice; we have enough problems. And we all have heart and we're going to build safe zones in Syria and we're going to have the Gulf States we owe $20 trillion in case you're not sure about it; we have lots of problems but we will have the Gulf States who have tremendous money, tremendous, and they haven't been carrying their weight; they haven't done much; haven't accepted any we're going to have the Gulf States, they'll be happy to do it; they're going to pay for it, but we're going to build safe zones, but we can't have them come into our country too much uncertainty. We just...we have enough problems. Wouldn't you say we have enough problems? So we'll take care of it. A Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a great wall. We're going to keep the drugs out. We're going to keep the poison out of our country that's destroying our youth and plenty of other people. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands and thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries would not under any circumstances take them back. Can you imagine that? They catch murderers, drug dealers, the worst people they bring them back and their country says we're not taking them. They go through the Secretary of State. She said, bring them back and the crime that's been committed by these people is unbelievable. I promise you this: there won't be one instance, not one, where when we bring somebody back to their country where they belong, where that plane comes back with that person sitting on that plane; there won't be one instance; there won't be one instance; it'll never happen. It's truly called a lack of respect for our country. Hillary supports totally opened borders there goes your country and strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who was deported at least five times. Thousands of Americans would be alive today if not for the open border policies of Obama and Clinton. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root who you know about, who you've ready it, who was right from Iowa, right from here, incredible person. I've spent time with her incredible family, beautiful family devastated. The illegal immigrant who killed Sarah arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the community despite the pleas of people that knew him please don't do this, don't do this right under the policies of the White House. He was released again and again but then he killed Sarah in a savage, savage way. Sarah graduated from college with a 4.0 grade index, number one in her class the day before she was killed. There are so many instances like this; so many instances like this. And people knew trouble but the Administration said we don't get involved. A Trump Administration will end this nightmare of violence that's going on all over our country. We will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens. And we're going to build that wall. It's going to be a great wall and let me just tell you, Mexico is going to pay for the wall; they don't know it yet; they don't know it yet they're starting to have a very good idea but that's OK. You know Mexico, they're great I met with the President of Mexico three months ago, great, but it's got to be a two lane highway. You know we lose so much we lose our plants, we lose our jobs, we lose our wealth and we get drugs and unemployment it's got to be a two way and it will be because the trade deficit with China and so many of these countries, but the trade deficit with Mexico is massive far greater than what we're talking about for the wall. So a lot of politicians said you can't get Mexico to pay for the wall. I said, it's going to be so easy; it's going to be so easy. But here's what you have to understand; we're going to have big, beautiful doors on that wall and people are going to come into our country and they're going to come into our country people, lots of people, are going to come into our country but they're coming into our country legally they come in legally. OK thank you very much everybody, we will. We're going to straighten things out. We're going to end up with very strong borders, believe me very, very strong borders. We will also repeal Obama/Clinton Defense Sequester and rebuild our badly-depleted military, badly-depleted. I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. Hillary and our failed establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never win and now it's worse shape than ever before. The Middle East is in far worse shape than it's ever been even from our standpoint. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've shipped our jobs and our wealth to other countries and left our borders wide open at home. We send our troops to foreign countries to defend their borders but our politicians refuse, they refuse to defend our borders. Isn't it amazing we fight to get the money, the blood, the great people, the great people, the loss and we fight to defend a border but we won't defend our own borders. That will change on November 8th, believe me. A Trump Administration will never, ever put the interests of a foreign country before the interests of our country. From now on it's going to be America first. To all Americans, I say this: it is time for real leadership and it is time for change. We're going to change. Hillary Clinton is not change. Hillary Clinton is four more years of Obama which is ISIS, which is all of these other things high taxes. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of the Trump Administration. We're going to have the big tax cut since Ronald Reagan and Hillary is going to raise taxes. We will save your Social Security as is without cuts and your Medicare. She is going to chop, chop, chop away. She is going to chop it away. We are going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, cancel illegal Obama Executive Orders. We will protect religious liberty, rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans, our greatest people. We're going to finally, once and for all, take care of our veterans. Our veterans have been horribly treated. We're going to provide school choice and put an end to Common Core we're bringing our education local. We will support the men and women these are great people of law enforcement. We'll save our Second Amend which is constantly under siege and deploy appoint Justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. It's time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past. Hillary Clinton is the candidate of yesterday. We, we, because this is the great movement there's never been anything like this in this country; I say it all the time Bill O'Reilly said it recently, numerous times. He said, in his lifetime this is the single greatest political phenomena that he has ever seen. It's you; I'm the messenger; I'm the messenger; it's you it really is; it is you. I'm a good messenger, you have to say, right? I've been a good messenger but it is you, the greatest they've seen. We're fighting for every parent who lost their child to drugs and crime and gang violence. We're fighting for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries, one of the primary reasons I got involved in this I couldn't watch it anymore as our companies...I live in New York. New York State ...New York State...what happened to New York State with the jobs going to Mexico and other places and when Hillary Clinton was Senator she said, she ran on the basis that she would create new jobs. I'll tell you what, just another lie it's worse than ever, ever, ever before. She did nothing; she did nothing. We're fighting for every American who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. I'm asking you to dream big because with your vote can you believe this; in just two days; we're two days away we will get the change you've been waiting for for your entire life. And I hope, I hope, that you will consider it the greatest and most important vote that you will ever cast because we will start winning again. We'll win on trade. We'll knock the hell out of ISIS. We will start winning again. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will America safe again and we will make America great again.

We're gonna win Minnesota. <APPLAUSE> We're leading big in Ohio. We're leading in Iowa. We're leading in New Hampshire, where I'm going in a little while. We're leading in North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> We're doing very, very well in Pennsylvania. Very well. You watch what's gonna happen in Pennsylvania. The miners are gonna come out, the workers are gonna come out, the steel workers who lost their jobs are coming out. By the way, lots of people surrounding Philadelphia are going to come out of there voting, because they want to vote. And you know who's gonna come out? The women are going to come out. You watch. <APPLAUSE> The women -- the women are going to come out big. It's all a phony deal. They're telling you a lot of phony stuff. They are so worried. You had to see them on television this morning. Oh, you know they get a note handed over that we're leading in, let's say, New Hampshire -- which we are -- they get a note. Very happy and everything, ""Oh, oh, oh. Mr. Trump is leading in New Hampshire."" You can see they're thrilled. They're totally thrilled. They are thrilled. By the way I just want to introduce -- I'm a big fan of Billy Graham. We all are. Who isn't right? Who isn't? Who isn't? <APPLAUSE> I'm also a big fan -- and he's been so incredible to me -- of Franklin Graham. He's a great guy. He's keeping it going. <APPLAUSE> And Billy Graham's granddaughter was here and spoke incredibly I hear, I hear. <APPLAUSE> But Cissie Graham Lynch is here someplace. Where's Cissie? Where is she? You were so great. Everybody's saying, if you can do as well as Cissie, you've done a good job. So thank you. <APPLAUSE> That is an amazing -- I will tell you, my father used to take me, they called it the Crusades. And that was the Crusades. It was a beautiful thing. But Billy Graham was amazing. I think -- is he 98 today? 98 years old, Billy Graham. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, Cissie. Really great. Say hello to your family. Billy Graham is 98 years old. This is an amazing -- truly one of the great, great man. Our failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty at home and disaster overseas. They get rich making America poor. It's time to reject a media and political elite that's bled our country dry. <APPLAUSE> It's finally time for us to fight for America. We're going to fight for America. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! >
<TRUMP:> I'm not a politician. My only special interest is you. <APPLAUSE> You know, I built a great company -- one of the great companies -- one of the great real estate companies. Some of the most incredible assets in the world, including Doral right down the road and lots of other things. Buildings on the beach with the Dezer family and with related. We've had a tremendous career. But -- and I was on the other side. You know my whole life I was always watching, watching. I was on the other side. It's very nice and very comfortable to be on the other side. But I love this country. <APPLAUSE> And this country was going bad. It was going bad.
<TRUMP:> So I went, like, from, sort of, an ultimate insider -- I mean, people that absolutely -- senators, they'd call, ""Don, how are you?"" You know, they'd come over every year, I'd give them a check for some crazy thing they're doing. And they'd say, ""Donald, how are you? How are you?"" The day I announced it was like, ""Donald who? We don't know -- we don't know Donald Trump."" <LAUGHTER> You have to see these guys. Oh, I know I'm better than anybody. It was time, it <ph> was time. I had to join the other side, which is you. We are going to do things so special. <APPLAUSE> Our country was in trouble, our country was in trouble, $20 trillion in debt, making deals like the deal with Iran where we give them $150 billion. <BOOING> Where we give them $1.7 billion in cash. You know what that is? That'd fill up this side of the arena. Nobody ever even heard of things like this. When you look at our military is allowed to deplete -- our military's very depleted. We can't do that, this is among the times where we most need a tremendous and powerful and smart military. We need smart people. <APPLAUSE> And Obamacare is a disaster, everything's wrong. <APPLAUSE> Our country doesn't win anymore. We're going to start winning again, OK? <APPLAUSE> Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> Its just been announced that the residence of Florida -- sorry to tell you this folks, I don't wanna -- I don't wanna make you depressed, you know half of you are gonna walk out of the room but don't do that -- are going to experience massive double digit premium hikes, OK? And they're far greater than what you've been told. You've been told numbers because they didn't wanna do it before the election. I worked very hard to force those numbers out. It's gonna have a great impact on -- you know, my poll numbers are going through the roof. You know why? I really believe a big part of it is Obamacare because we're gonna repeal it and replace it. <APPLAUSE> In the great state of Arizona, premiums are going up more than 116 percent. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare and they're losing the insurers that put Obamacare there. But you know what? We're gonna make it 100 percent of the counties because we're gonna terminate Obamacare and it's not going to make a difference. <APPLAUSE> We'll be terminating Obamacare and we'll be replacing it with so many different options, but you'll have great health care at a fraction -- a fraction of the cost and it'll be great. <APPLAUSE> With Obamacare, premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof. Yet, crooked Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. Gonna go way up, gonna go way up, Obamacare is going much higher.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> Nobody in this room can believe what's going on in Washington. Nobody in this room can believe what's going on with the FBI and what's going on with the Department of Justice, nobody, nobody can. <BOOING> Nobody can believe it. I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and in our great country. <APPLAUSE> Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. She threatened national security, she sold her office to the highest bidder and then to cover her tracks, she deleted at least 33,000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena. <BOOING> Hillary Clinton is being protected by a totally rigged system. And now, it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box tomorrow, that's what's gonna happen.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> That's what's gonna happen. <APPLAUSE> My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take back our country and to take it back swiftly from the special interests who I know so well. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we are all about to say. When we win tomorrow, we are going to drain the swamp.
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp! (APPLAUSE) Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!>
<TRUMP:> You know, the other day, you read where Hillary Clinton called entertainers because she can't get anybody -- nobody wants to go. I mean, look, I don't know. I see she's doing fine, I'm doing fine in the polls and all that stuff. I don't know how. Nobody goes to her rallies. So she got Jay-Z and Beyonce and the language they used was so bad. The language. <BOOING> The language was so bad. And as they were singing, singing right? <LAUGHTER> Talking? Was it talking or singing? I don't know. But the language <inaudible> the language was so bad that many of the people left. By the time Hillary got up, there was nobody there. <LAUGHTER> But the crooked media, those people back there, the most dishonest people. <BOOING> The crooked media does nothing, they don't explain it. They don't explain it. And isn't it amazing that when Jay-Z and Beyonce use the filthy language that they use in the songs, using words that if I ever said those words, it would be the reinstitution of the electric chair, right? <LAUGHTER> It's true. It's true. They use these words and then she comes on and hugs them like everything's right. And yet with me, ""He's very lewd."" That's a new word, you know, lewd. I mean, I've never seen anything like it in my life. She is such a phony. She is such a phony. <APPLAUSE> I will say this, I don't think that Billy Graham ever spoke like this. Do we agree? This is different than a Billy Graham crusade. But you know what, we're all looking for the same thing. We're looking for greatness for our country, we're looking for religious liberty -- looking for religious liberty. <APPLAUSE> But we are somewhat different personalities. Look at this mask. Look at this mask. Wow. That's beautiful. Look at that. Looks just like me. <APPLAUSE> Nice head of hair, I'll say that. <LAUGHTER> Thank you. Thank you. Is there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally? <APPLAUSE> At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. <APPLAUSE> Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by his lovely wife, Hillary.<BOOING>
<TRUMP:> America has lost, hard to believe this, 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world. Look, no country has ever lost jobs like us. They're sucked out of our country, the companies leave, they fire everybody, they go to Mexico and many other countries. It never happened before like this. And we're going to stop it day one. It's so easy to stop. It's so easy. <APPLAUSE> So easy to stop. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. Promise. <APPLAUSE> If a company wants to fire their workers, leave Florida and move to another country like Mexico as an example, and then ship their products back into the United States through what will become an unbelievably strong border, I will tell you... <APPLAUSE> ... we will make them pay a 35 percent tax on those products. <APPLAUSE> And I'll tell you what's gonna happen. I'll tell you what's gonna happen. Nobody's gonna leave because the model no longer works. You know, Ford is leaving. I was in Michigan last night. Ford is leaving. They're all leaving. That's why I'm going to win Michigan. I believe we're gonna win Michigan. <APPLAUSE> Michigan they've ripped -- they have ripped cars out of there, factories out of there, plants out of there. Same thing Ohio, so many companies have gone to Mexico and other countries. And we're going to win these states by tremendous amounts because people are tired of being ripped off. That's what's happening. They're being ripped off. They're being led by politicians who frankly -- you know, I went to an Ivy League school, I was a good student, all that stuff. But some words are just like, you can't duplicate them, right? We're tired of being led by stupid people. They're stupid. They're stupid people. <APPLAUSE> We will renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China and stop the job- killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will be a disaster. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton said it's the gold standard, and she's right. Remember she lied in the debate? She said she never said it. I said you did say it. She said -- well, it turned out she lied, she did say it. It was the gold standard. I say she was right though. It's the gold standard for the other countries, not for us. So she was actually right. She should have said that, she would have stopped a lie. She doesn't know what she's doing. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> And we are going to massively cut taxes for the middle class who I call -- who I call the forgotten people. These are the forgotten men and women. They built our country. They built our country. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes. Wants to raise taxes. Oh, I love those signs. Blacks for Trump. Hold that sign up. <APPLAUSE> I'm telling you, Blacks for Trump. You know, one of the things they're seeing in a couple of these states like Florida, African- Americans aren't turning out and when they do there are a lot of them voting for Trump. This is very disturbing to the other side. <APPLAUSE> They're not turning out because they don't care about her. She's got not a lot of inspiration. She used a term called super-predator to define black youth, right? Super-predator. And they're not turning out. They're not turning out. And then they're worried because when they do turn out, I'm getting so many more than was anticipated. <APPLAUSE> I think the same is going to be true with Hispanics. You know, the Cubans gave me the award, the Bay of Pigs Association... <APPLAUSE> The Bay of Pigs Association last week gave me the award, Man of the Year. The Bay of Pigs Association and it was a great honor. No, we're gonna do great with the African-Americans, we're gonna do great with the Hispanics. And the other side is starting to see it and they are not happy. They are not happy.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> We're gonna be one country, we're not gonna be a divided nation anymore, we're a divided nation. We are a divided nation. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you, proud of our country. We will also cancel billions and billions of dollars in global warming payments to the United Nations where those payments disappear. <APPLAUSE> And we're gonna use all of that money to invest in the infrastructure and we could even say the environmental infrastructure of our country. <APPLAUSE> And remember this, remember this. When it comes to environment because I receive many environmental awards, you know, people don't wanna talk about that, that's OK. But we need absolutely crystal clear and clean water. <APPLAUSE> We need beautiful, immaculate air. And we need safety and we need safety. We give billions and billions of dollars away, you can imagine who's taking that money, you can imagine. We don't even know what happens to it. And we -- he goes, Hillary is taking it. Probably, hey, you're pretty smart, probably. Probably she gets her piece. And we will create jobs and opportunities for African-Americans and Hispanic Americans that have been failed so badly. They've been lied to, they've been cheated to by the Democratic Party. They want their vote, give us your vote, thanks a lot, see you in four years. That's what happens. <APPLAUSE> We're gonna do our job. For instance, I met recently with the leaders in the Puerto Rican community, a community that's -- it's a great community, I know it well. And they're being crushed by high taxes, regulations and failed education policies of Hillary Clinton and Obama. You know where Obama is now? Not working on jobs, not working on Mosul, where they gave him four months advanced notice, our military. We are going into Mosul, four months, right? In four months, we are expecting to enter Mosul. I'm turning -- I said please, turn off the television, I can't hear. The element of surprise, folks. So then, I hear three months, yes, in three months we'll be attacking Mosul. Now, it's two months. Then it's a month. Then it's two weeks. We're preparing now, to go into Mosul, we wanna get their leaders because you know ISIS, supposedly the leaders are -- don't they realize that the first time before they finished the first sentence four months ago, those leaders have already found new places. Don't they understand that? Oh, General Douglas MacArthur, where are you, sir? Where is our General George Patton? Where are they, where is General Patton? <APPLAUSE> Where is General George Patton? You know where they are? They're watching and they're spinning in their grave, they don't believe it. Wouldn't it be nice if we just shut up, did the job, had a news conference a week later and said we had great success, wouldn't that be nice, now? That's Obama, that's Obama. <APPLAUSE> And you know what? Hillary, that would be four more years of Obama and we don't want it. And tell... <BOOING> And tell this president to stop campaigning and go back to work. <APPLAUSE> I'm going to deliver jobs, safety, great education, help small businesses to thrive and grow and create amazing opportunities for the children of this country. Here in Florida, we have such an amazing, incredible Hispanic- American community from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti. I was in little Haiti the other day, great people. They are such warm, great people. By the way, warm, great people, I spent a lot of time with them. They hate the Clintons, they hate what the Clintons did to them in Haiti, they hate them.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> The Dominican Republic and from many other places to all of our wonderful Hispanic communities in this state, I want you to know that you will have a true friend and champion in Donald Trump. That I can tell you. <APPLAUSE> Whether you vote for me or not, I'm with you. I will never ever let you down. We will become a rich nation once again, but to be a rich nation, we must also a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in the inflow of Syrian refugees into our country, 550 percent. <BOOING> Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and through out your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. <APPLAUSE> And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> And you know what folks, all of us I am speaking for all of us, we all have heart and I have to say this in front of Sissy <ph> anyway. We all have heart and we're gonna build safe zones in Syria. We're gonna get the Gulf states -- they have tremendous amounts of money, I know them well and they're gonna help. They're gonna put up all the money. We're not gonna put up money. We're gonna lead it and we'll do a great a job. But we're gonna get the Gulf states to put up the money. We owe $20 trillion and we have to rebuild our own country, it's time, it's time. <APPLAUSE> But we're gonna build safe zones in Syria and we have to do that because what's happening is just a horrible thing, what's happening. But we have enough problems in our country. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the boarders of the United States. And yes, we will build a great wall, and yes, Mexico will pay for the wall. They're gonna pay for the wall. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!>
<TRUMP:> We have to keep the massive amounts of drugs that are pouring into our country and poising our youth -- we have to keep it out. Never before has there been a drug epidemic like we have in our country, and much of it is coming through the southern border. And it's pouring in, it's pouring in and it truly is poisoning our youth and plenty of other people. We are going to keep it out and we are going to work very hard with medical professionals to take care of those people that are so badly addicted. Right? <APPLAUSE> Hillary supports totally open boarders. There goes you country. There goes your country, folks. <BOOING> And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who was deported probably more than five times. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. <APPLAUSE> We will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our cities. <APPLAUSE> They're threatening our cities, they are threatening our citizens, they are not going to be here very long, folks. They're gonna be out of here. We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We have no choice. <APPLAUSE><APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> This defense build-up will be supported by brand-new ships in Mayport and by engineers and new advanced manufacturing of the Space Coast. OK? You know the Space Coast has been like lost. New aircraft will fly from MacDill Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola. <APPLAUSE> We're also going to support our friends in Cuba in their fight against oppression, the oppression of the Castro regime. <APPLAUSE> Tremendous repression. We will demand political and religious freedom for the people of Cuba and stand with our friends in Venezuela in their struggle likewise for freedom we will stand. <APPLAUSE> And we're always going to help the people of Haiti who have such a tremendous difficult path. But we will help them and help them rebuild. The people of Haiti, incredible people. I really enjoyed that time with them. Very importantly we'll also stand strong -- we have to stand strong with the state of Israel in their fight against Islamic terrorism. <APPLAUSE> Barack Obama was the worst thing that ever happened to Israel. The worst thing. <BOOING> The worst thing that ever happened to Israel. Barack Obama was a disaster for Israel. And believe me, the Iran deal where we made them rich, we also gave them a direct path right to nuclear weapons. But we'll be working with Israel very closely, very, very closely. I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 -- and that number is raising -- rising very quickly. And 22 Medal of Honor recipients. Incredible people. <APPLAUSE> We were with them the other night right next to Fort Bragg. And I'll tell you we had 22,000 maybe 25,000 people in a field. It was the most incredible thing you've ever seen. Incredible. These are incredible people. These are truly great patriots and they are truly brave. Hillary unleashed destruction in Iraq, Syria, Libya, she empowered Iran and she unleashed ISIS onto the world. There was no ISIS when she was secretary of State. Then they allowed the way they -- look, we should have never been in Iraq, but we were. We should have never gotten out of Iraq the way Obama and Clinton got us out. Never. . <APPLAUSE> A vacuum was formed and -- thank you very much. We now have ISIS in 32 countries all over the world unleashed by Obama and Hillary Clinton. But we're gonna knock them out. We have no choice. We're gonna knock them out, folks. We're gonna knock them out. <APPLAUSE> That's one we have chopping off heads, drowning people in steel cages. Not since Medieval times have we seen anything like this. Not since Medieval times have we seen anything like this. And then I'm in one of the debates -- did I win the debates by the way? Did I win?
<AUDIENCE: Yes! (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> They did nine online polls after the debates and all nine said I won. And she was in debate prep all the time. I was guilty, I was saying like -- they kept saying are you in debate prep? I said, yeah, I've been doing this stuff all my life. I'm supposed to be studying like -- she was in debate prep but it wasn't really. Look, for a week and a half before each debate she would close the door, go to sleep and say it was debate prep right? ? <LAUGHTER> And then when she left those debates, she was exhausted. I'll tell you, when she left the second and third debate she was exhausted. Not what we need in our country, folks. We need a lot of energy in our country and a lot of bum-bum <ph>. We need a lot of things. We don't need Hillary. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Get out and vote. Get out and -- who's already voted? <APPLAUSE> That's pretty good. Wow. You've almost all voted. All right. Goodbye, everybody. <LAUGHTER> Well, that's what the Democrats do to the inner cities you know. They say oh they voted, let's get out of here. I'll see you in four years. Wow, that's pretty good. All right. For the few people that haven't, that's a very impressive -- I love you too. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> I love you too.
<TRUMP:> Get out and vote for the few that haven't. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe and that we never win, we never win. Shipped our -- I don't think you like Hillary very much. Oh boy, what a -- what a disaster this is -- she gets in, it's a disaster. She's not gonna get in folks, I don't see it. I'll tell you, I don't see it. Not getting... <APPLAUSE> They've shipped our jobs and our -- Hillary -- all over the world and left our borders wide open at home. That will all change starting actually tomorrow, actually tomorrow. <APPLAUSE> Because while we don't take office until mid-January, the whole psyche will change as of tomorrow, right, this guy knows. Firemen, firemen, right, great firemen, great people, great, great people. <APPLAUSE> Not easy being a fireman today, right? Oh, thank you. I see a great fireman over here. I was with the fire groups the other day, they have a new problem, nobody ever heard of this problem. You know about it, oh can I -- oh, wow, get that for me, wow. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Great, that's great, thank you. Tell you what, I was all set to put it on then I see it's about 20 years old and this sucker has been used. <LAUGHTER> No way I'm putting that on. No, but the firemen have a big -- they have a big problem, they have a shooting problem where they're being shot at as they go into fires. This is a new phenomenon, people don't even know about it. They're being shot at as they go to fires, they're being shot at as they put out fires <inaudible>. So we gotta change, folks, we have to -- we have to bring people together. We have such a divided country, thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. From now on, it's going to be America first. To all Americans, I say it is time for change, it is time for new, strong and smart leadership. <APPLAUSE> Just in summing up...
<AUDIENCE: (OFF-MIKE)>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Think I'm gonna be doing six of these today, can you believe that? <APPLAUSE> Six, going to North Carolina, we're going to all over, we're going to New Hampshire right after. Its gonna be great. I love doing it because there's such spirit, the people -- the people of this country are so incredible. Oh, look at that, look at that, beautiful, beautiful baby, beautiful baby, good job. Good job, daddy. Wow. Oh, that's an elephant costume, that's so cute. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, that's very nice, thank you. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We are going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes. We will save and protect Social Security and Medicare. Hillary is going to cut your Social Security and cut your Medicare benefits. We will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation, they're killing our businesses, cancel every illegal Obama executive order of which there are many. <APPLAUSE> In honor of the great Billy Graham, we will protect religious liberty. <APPLAUSE> Rebuild our military and take great care finally of our veterans. Our veterans are not being treated properly.<APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> Provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. Bring our education local. <APPLAUSE> Support the great men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> Save our Second Amendment, which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> And appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> This is so hard to believe. You have one day until the election. You know what that means? That means tomorrow. You have one day to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true. You have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system and deliver justice. You will deliver justice for every forgotten man, forgotten woman and forgotten child in this nation. <APPLAUSE> Do not let this opportunity slip away. We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. <APPLAUSE> And we are fighting to bring us all together as Americans. Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag. <APPLAUSE> 
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. I'm asking you to dream big. Because with your vote we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. <APPLAUSE> I think and hope it will be the most important vote you will ever cast, because we don't win anymore as a country. We don't win on the borders, we don't win with trade. What China is doing to us is beyond belief. We don't win anymore. We don't win with our military. We have the greatest people in the world. But we don't beat ISIS. We don't win anymore. We will start winning again and winning like you've never seen before, tell you. <APPLAUSE> We're going to win again. In fact, the people of Florida may get tired of it. You're going to say, ""Oh this guy, he wins too much! We can't take it. He wins too much!"" You'll send your emissary, ""Please, Mr. President, the people of Florida just don't want to win this much. You're winning on trade. You're bringing back jobs. You're winning at the border. The military is unbelievable, it's too much."" And I'll say, ""Sorry, folks. We're going to keep on winning,"" right? <APPLAUSE> Together we will make American wealthy and prosperous again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless you. Go out and vote! Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<TRUMP:> This is amazing. What a great place. Thank you very much. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. But we should start. Do we agree? <APPLAUSE> We should start. So they'll come in. They'll come in.
<AUDIENCE: We love you, Trump.>
<TRUMP:> First of all I want to thank you. Special, special place. It's a special place with incredible people. In one day, do you believe this? One day we are going to win the great state of North Carolina... <APPLAUSE> And we are going to win back the White House. <APPLAUSE> This election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political <inaudible>. You're seeing what's happening. Everybody's watching. Or whether we are ruled by the people. We're going to be ruled by the people, folks. <APPLAUSE> That is going to be the choice. A failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty, nothing but problems, nothing but losses. Nothing but losses. We don't win anymore as a country. We're going to start winning again. <APPLAUSE> They get rich by making America poorer in many cases. It's time to reject the media and political elite that has bled our country dry. <APPLAUSE> And these are among the most dishonest people. They don't give you the truth, folks. They don't give you the truth. <BOOING> They rarely give you the truth. You know it. And they know it. That's the scary part. They know it. It's time to fight for America. I'm not a politician, I can say proudly. My only special interest is you. It's you. <APPLAUSE> We're going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you. We're going to bring back the wealth that has been taken from our country. We're going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers. We're going to put them back to work. <APPLAUSE> The economic policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the entire country.
<AUDIENCE: Preach!>
<TRUMP:> The corrupt Clintons gave us NAFTA. China's too horrible entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the disasters. The job-killing deal with South Korea. That was a Hillary Clinton beauty. And the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will be a total disaster. <BOOING> That Hillary Clinton said this is the gold standard. And you know what? It is the gold -- she lied. She lied during the debate. She said -- hey, by the way, who won the debate? Did we win that debate? <APPLAUSE> But she lied during the debate. She lied during the debate. She said it's the gold standard. And then she said she never said it. Don't worry about coal. We're bringing back coal, sir. He's holding up a couple of... <APPLAUSE> Clean coal. Clean coal. Right? We're going to do clean coal, the miners. The miners are going to be back. Not if Hillary Clinton gets in. The miners, I guess you got to start thinking about something else. But the miners are going to be back. Clean coal. Clean coal. You know, thinking about it, though. Also, people, the press doesn't talk about it. Donna Brazile gets the questions through a debate... <BOOING> ... but then it turns out to be a number of debates. <BOOING> Who cares about Donna Brazile? She's turned out to be not what people thought. She gets, illegally -- illegally. She gets the questions to the debate. She then takes those questions and gives them to crooked Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> Now, does crooked Hillary report it? Does she say I shouldn't have these questions or these answers? I think they gave them the answers also, right? No, she doesn't. They doesn't. I wonder if she had -- I wonder if she had the questions in my debates. I don't think so because she didn't do that well. I don't think so. I don't think so. But the years of betrayal will end. And they will end. And they're going to end quickly. They're going to end as of the day we take office, which is going to be very, very soon. <APPLAUSE> The theft of North Carolina jobs will end. You've taken in harder than most states. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> Sadly, it's just been announced that the residents of North Carolina are going to experience massive double-digit premium hikes. Ninety-five... <BOOING> ... of the 100 North Carolina counties will only have one insurer in the Obamacare exchange next year. Lots of luck negotiating. Honestly, it's not going to matter because we're going to win and we're going to terminate it. You're going to have such great health care... <APPLAUSE> ... for much less money. It won't matter. <APPLAUSE> <Inaudible> are searching. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting. By the way, doctors, they're leaving. They're quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor. He said that I have more accountants than I have nurses, it's so complicated. And deductibles are going through the roof. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down and expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. <BOOING> I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare, and save health care for every family in North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you.
<AUDIENCE: Trump. Trump. Trump.>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. <APPLAUSE> People are pouring in, folks. They're pouring in. Did you see last night in Michigan the crowd we had? And the crowd we had -- by the way, how about 24,000 maybe 25,000 right next to Fort Brag. You saw that the other night. <APPLAUSE> And we went to Minnesota. Minnesota's been treated very, very badly. We went to Minnesota where we're doing very well. Everyone said why Minnesota? That doesn't go Republican. It's going Republican this day, I'll tell you. Minnesota. Great place. And you know, you've been watching and you've been seeing and these people are being driven crazy, the <inaudible>. We're winning Ohio. We're winning Iowa. We're winning, we think, New Hampshire. We're going to do great in New Hampshire. I hear we're winning North Carolina big... <APPLAUSE> I hear. We're winning Florida. We're winning Florida, doing really well. Headlines today are <inaudible> how well we're doing in Florida. And I think we're going to win the great state of Pennsylvania, I do. Then we're winning plenty of other places. So we have to go. The big key, you have to go. You don't win a rigged system, folks. We're in a rigged system. You got to go. You got to vote. Got to make sure that vote gets registered. Real change also means restoring honesty to our <inaudible>.
<AUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA.>
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Great, great spirit. I have a job right next to -- we have a beautiful, beautiful property right next to -- right near Charlotte. You know about it, folks? It's great right? Some of the people. But it's an amazing place. It's an amazing place to work and to live, and we love it. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. <BOOING> She threatened national security, <inaudible> to the highest bidder. And then to cover her tracks... <BOOING> ... she needed 33,000... <BOOING> She's being protected by a totally rigged system -- General James Cartwright -- nothing happened. A four-star general. Three weeks ago -- a totally rigged system, folks. But he said he did <inaudible>. You know James Cartwright... <AUDIO GAP> ... life was destroyed. And here she is. She's running for president. She's done 25 times worse than anybody's ever dreamt. <BOOING> It's a rigged system. It is a rigged, rigged system.
<AUDIENCE: Trump. Trump. Trump.>
<TRUMP:> Don't worry, folks. The cameras will never spin around and show this crowd. They never do. <inaudible> my face and the two people behind me, not the thousands behind me. They never do. They never do. <APPLAUSE> <BOOING> So dishonest. There they are. There they are. My group. Women for Trump. <APPLAUSE> Women for Trump. <APPLAUSE> They've been following me, these ladies, for a long time. How are we doing? Are we doing well?
<AUDIENCE: Yes.>
<TRUMP:> Great people. Women for Trump. And now it's up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow. At the ballot box. We're going to win. I think it's a great way of showing what we have to show in light of what's going on with justice in this country. I really do. I think it's a great way. You show it tomorrow. We show it tomorrow. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests. <APPLAUSE> And folks, I was on the other side for a long time. It's a very good place to be. But I love the country. I love this country. I've really gotten to love the people of this country because I have been everywhere. We have the greatest people on earth. But I love this country. And I couldn't watch it when they made the Iran deal. They gave them $150 billion, a terrorist state. <BOOING> A state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful. We gave them a path to nuclear weapons. They were ready to collapse. We gave them, remember, $400 billion, right? We gave them $400 million. Then we found out that was -- it wasn't $400 million. It was $1.7 billion in cash. In cash. Do you know what $1.7 billion in cash is? You could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldn't have enough room. How stupid are we to allow this to happen? Our leaders are incompetent. President Obama is campaigning today with Hillary Clinton because she can't campaign. <BOOING> She can't campaign. <BOOING> So Obama is taking Air Force One, which costs a fortune. You know he's very much into the environment. And he'll take a massive, old engine 747. Very much into the environment. Very much into the ozone layer. And yet he'll fly that 747 all over the place to campaign for crooked Hillary. And I don't think it's going to work. And she's not getting any crowds. So she gets Beyonce and Jay-Z. I like them. <BOOING> I like them. <BOOING> And you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. <APPLAUSE> It's true. I get far bigger crowds. <APPLAUSE> Look at this place. I mean, look at the crowds we had in Michigan. By the way, Michigan is in play. It hasn't been in play for Republicans for 30 something years. Michigan is in play because they're tired of watching their car factories be taken out. They're tired of losing their jobs to Mexico. Ford. Ford right now moved all of its small car production to Mexico. They're building the biggest plants in the world in Mexico. And Michigan <inaudible> complaining about it for five years to Michigan. <APPLAUSE> No, we're going to have some -- tomorrow's going to be a very historic day. I really believe that. I think it's going to show -- I think it's going to be a Brexit plus, plus, plus. Does that make sense? <APPLAUSE> Plus, plus, plus. <APPLAUSE> It will be amazing. It will be amazing. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we're all about to say. This is a phrase, I told you. I didn't like it. I thought it was hokie. But it's not hokie. It's called ""drain the swamp.""
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp.>
<TRUMP:> We're going to go to Washington. We're going to drain the swamp. Can't believe it. I told the story. I hated that expression. I said no way I'm going to say that, no way. That's so hokie. And I said it. The place went crazy. Then I said it to another place. It went crazier. Then I said it with more confidence because you know confidence is -- and it went wild. Now I love the expression. I think it was genius.
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp.>
<TRUMP:> Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. <LAUGHTER>
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp.>
<TRUMP:> Is there any place better to be than a Trump rally? Are we having fun? <APPLAUSE> Are we having fun? No? And I don't have a guitar. And I don't have a piano. All we have is great concepts for our country, which is the most important thing. Because frankly, when people get on stage, and they're entertainers, and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for Hillary Clinton. And by the way, they use the dirtiest language the other night. And it was -- many of the people left. You know they're political people. They heard words they've never heard before. They left. So the place was half empty by the time -- actually, it never got full, even with them. Then it was pretty much empty midway through. And then most of the people just left. And when Hillary got up there was practically -- she might as well just have started with a few people. It would've been easier. <LAUGHTER> But you know she hears those words. I won't use the words. I won't even address the words. Because if I do the crooked media will say ""did you hear what Donald Trump said today?"" <BOOING> But honestly -- yes. <BOOING> Those words were disgusting. If I ever said those words that Jay-Z said or that Beyonce said the other night, you know what would happen to me? The reinstitution of the electric chair. It would be -- how about if I got the answers to the debate? Or if I got the questions? Supposing instead of Hillary getting the questions to the debate, which is cheating. She's a cheat. She is a cheat. She never reported it. She is a cheat. So supposing instead of her -- supposing somebody gave Donald Trump the questions to the debate. Headlines all over the world. He must withdraw from the race. You don't even hear anything about crooked Hillary. She got the questions. To me that's such a big difference. Some people say, my people, oh don't mention that, it's just -- I say to me it's a big deal.
<AUDIENCE: It is.>
<TRUMP:> It's a big deal. But it's not a big deal for the dishonest media to say. They don't want to report it. But just think about it, supposing it was us. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Bring them back to America. <APPLAUSE> And by the way, you have a great governor. Support your governor. He's a great guy. <APPLAUSE> Where is he? He's here someplace. He's a great guy and he's in a tough fight. And he's going to win that fight. But he's a great guy. So hopefully you'll support your governor. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and his lovely wife, Hillary. <BOOING> Well think of it. Think of it. Think of the numbers of jobs. Here's the one that gets me the most. Two things get me the most. Two things that just don't seem real. Because we're going to take care of our veterans, right? Like big league. Because our veterans are great. But two statistics I can't believe. Twenty-two suicides a day for our veterans.
<AUDIENCE: No.>
<TRUMP:> Think of it. You wouldn't think that's possible. Because they're treated so badly. They wait on line for six, seven, eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescription. But two numbers I don't -- it just doesn't make sense. Twenty- two suicides a day for our veterans. OK? It doesn't make sense. And here's another one. America has lost 70,000 factories. Now I thought they meant 700 or 7,000 maybe. It's 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary Clinton-backed disaster. Think of it though. <BOOING> Think of what 70,000 factories is. So those are the two numbers. They just don't seem to be real. Sad numbers. Sad numbers. Especially the vets, to be honest with you. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world. There's never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the United States. Our jobs are fleeing. Our companies are being taken. And leaving. And leaving. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America. And we will stop the jobs from leaving North Carolina. Believe me. <APPLAUSE> If a company wants to fire their workers and leave, as an example North Carolina, and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States through what will be a very strong border, by the way.
<AUDIENCE: Yes.>
<TRUMP:> We will make them pay a 35 percent tax on every product that they ship back here. <APPLAUSE> And here's what's going to happen. They're not going to leave. They're not going to leave. Now your politicians, some of them don't understand it. <Inaudible> only cut taxes for the middle class. And by the way, Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes, and you know that. <BOOING> Substantially. So one of the highest taxes in the world, she wants to raise your taxes. Same old story. We will unleash the power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. Our plan will end the EPA intrusion into your family farms, and stop double taxation of a family farm at that. <APPLAUSE> We will cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations. Billions and billions of dollars. And we have no idea what they do with that money. I actually have a pretty good idea. You're not going to like it. And use that -- we're going to use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. <APPLAUSE> And we will rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community, the Hispanic community... <APPLAUSE> ... have had such lies told to them. They live -- many, many people living in the inner cities of our country, they're getting worse and worse. The crime is unbelievable. You can't walk to the store and get a loaf of bread. Often you get shot. Chicago. Thousands and thousands of shootings since Jan. 1. You read it. The murder rate of the United States is the highest it's been in 45 years. The dishonest media doesn't tell you that stuff because they want you to like Obama. They want you to think Obama is doing a good job. And he's not. <BOOING> And he's not. <BOOING> And he's not. <BOOING> So you live in the inner cities. You're African-American. You're Hispanic. The schools are no good. There are no jobs. And it's totally unsafe. And I say I will fix it. What the hell do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it. <APPLAUSE> We are all going to fix it. <APPLAUSE> We're going to fix it. We're going to bring back jobs. We're going to bring back safety. And we're going to get really good education going. <Inaudible> tremendous potential, folks, in the inner cities, believe me, tremendous potential. We will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. <BOOING> Unbelievable. It's unbelievable. <BOOING> Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. And you don't even know where they're going. Your government doesn't even know where they're going. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program... <APPLAUSE> ... and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> Have no choice. <APPLAUSE> We have no choice.
<AUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA. >
<TRUMP:> We have no choice. But we're going to work because we all have hearts and it's a big problem, caused to a large extent by Obama and Hillary Clinton. The migration, caused to a large extent -- ISIS was caused by them. They left a big vacuum. There was no ISIS when she first served as secretary. There was no ISIS. She created it. Now she stands at the debate, ""I will fight ISIS."" She's got no chance. She's going to fight nobody. She wants to go home and go to sleep. <LAUGHTER> Unbelievable. She's going to fight ISIS. So we're going to build -- we're going to build, we are going to build safe havens. We're going to have the Gulf States who have nothing but money, they're going to pay for it. We have $20 trillion in debt. And if it's OK, I'm not going to spend <inaudible>. We have $20 trillion in debt. And we still have to rebuild our country. You know it's one thing like when you buy a company and it's got some debt. We have $20 trillion in debt. But the country's a mess. The roads are bad. The bridges are bad. The schools are bad. The hospitals are bad. The tunnels are bad. Everything's bad. The military needs massive amounts of money. So we have all this horrible debt. It's one thing if we had it and everything's in tippy top shape. I like to say. You know I like the properties. Give me them. I want them. Give me them. But we have them and they're a mess. And we have $20 trillion, which is far too much. So we're going to get it down. And we're going to rebuild our <inaudible>. We have so many things we're going to be doing. We're going to be a rich nation again. <APPLAUSE> A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. <APPLAUSE> And yes, we will build a great wall and Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> One hundred percent. <APPLAUSE> Mexico will pay. If you look at the incredible -- if you look at the incredible deficits we have with Mexico, it's unbelievable. What we have, the cost of that wall is peanuts, is peanuts compared to the numbers you're talking about on trade with Mexico. And the numbers with China? Trade deficit? I mean we will have a trade deficit with China of close to $500 billion this year. We are going to lose in worldwide trade of goods, we're going to lose worldwide close to $800 billion. What are we doing? You really ask, who is negotiating these deals? Where do these people come? You know where they come from? They're political hacks. You're dealing with the smartest people in the world. You have Chinese people, every -- you have from Japan, you have from all these other countries. They put their smartest and the best. We put political hacks that don't know what they're doing. So we have an -- and we have the greatest in the world. We have the greatest business people. We have the greatest negotiators. We don't use them. We don't use them. We use political people. Some of them got their job because they give campaign contributions. <BOOING> We're going to get it straightened out, folks, starting tomorrow. Go vote. Go vote. <APPLAUSE> Right? My women. Hillary supports totally open borders. There goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered violently by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. <APPLAUSE> We will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens. <APPLAUSE> We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton Defense sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military. <APPLAUSE> There have been few times in our history where we've needed it more, few times. North Carolina will be at the very center of this effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. <APPLAUSE> Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful new fighters from Seymour Johnson. And we're going to have more battalions. You know the Marines are way, way off in terms of numbers. You know that. I know. Has there ever been? Yes, there have been. But rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now. The world hates us. The world hates us. So we're going to increase -- thank you. We're going to increase Marine battalions at Camp Lejeune. I've been to Camp Lejeune.... <APPLAUSE> They make major new investments. Where I was the other night, right next to it. I guess like 25,000 or 27,000 people at Fort Bragg. <APPLAUSE> Great people. All soldiers are tough. A couple of them shook my hand. It was like oy, whoa. Take it easy, fellas. They are tough cookies. They are strong. They don't know how strong they are. These are great people. And new military technologies will be researched and developed right here at the Research Triangle. Right here. <APPLAUSE> I'm honored to have the endorsements of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. And every day those numbers go up big league. Big league. And I asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by Fort Bragg. I asked them. I said fellas, let me ask you a question. They want to take over Mosul. Am I getting something wrong? Whatever happened to the element of surprise for us? I'm talking to admirals now and generals. That's what they do. I do other things. But you know it's called like common sense. You got to say we've made a lot of right calls. I said why is it that four months away from going into Mosul they're announcing ""we are going into Mosul?"" We're going into Mosul because we want to get the leaders of ISIS and they're staying in Mosul. And then three months they're saying ""we are going in, in three months to Mosul."" And then we're going in, in two months. And every time I hear, I put my hands, I go like this. I don't want to hear this, please. And as you know, they've been met with tremendous resistance, much more than they would've been. And I guarantee you this. I can't say it with certainty, only about 99.9 percent, OK? I can't say -- nothing's 100 percent. Even our victory isn't 100 percent. But it's starting to look pretty close, isn't it? <APPLAUSE> Those numbers. Those numbers. <APPLAUSE> Oh, these guys are unhappy. Look at them. They're not happy. They are unhappy campers. Starting to look good. <BOOING> Starting to look good. But wouldn't it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago. Then they have last -- two weeks ago they go next week we're getting ready to raid. The leaders all left. They're gone. And the other people are putting up much more of a fight. Horrible. They're using human shields. It's a horrible situation. I mean it's hell. It's hell. But why do we <inaudible> watch what's going on. Hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East that we never win. We just keep fighting and fighting. It's like a hose. The money just keeps pouring out. We never win. And now the Middle East is in worse shape by far than it's ever been. We have the Great Migration, the whole thing. They've dragged -- thank you. <APPLAUSE> I don't even want to look. I'll get myself. I don't want to look. <LAUGHTER> They'll make it -- I won't even say I love you too because they're going to make it a major headline if I said that. World's most dishonest people. The world's really dishonest people. <BOOING> They dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. Shipped our jobs and wealth all over -- right open at home. You ever notice we send these incredible troops, so much death, so much injury, in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of. And yet we don't protect our own borders. Isn't it an incredible thing? That will change starting tomorrow. <APPLAUSE> Because from now on it's going to be America first, America first. <APPLAUSE> So just in summing up, to all Americans I say it's time for a real leadership and time for change. We have to have change. <APPLAUSE> Can you imagine having Hillary for four years? <BOOING> I'm being serious about that. I wouldn't want to watch the news every night. I mean look at what she's done with the e-mails as an example. I mean did you ever see a mess like this? Did you ever see -- of course the FBI -- the director was obviously under tremendous pressure. So they went through 650,000 e-mails in eight days. Right. So sad what's going on. And she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from Congress. I mean that's a crime. What happened? That's a crime. You don't even need the new stuff. She shouldn't be allowed to run.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up...>
<TRUMP:> Shouldn't be allowed to run. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. <APPLAUSE> We're going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan.
<AUDIENCE: Yes. (APPLAUSE)>
<TRUMP:> And Hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially. We're going to save and protect your Social Security and Medicare. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary is going to cut your Social Security and really injure Medicare. That's what's going to happen. We will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation. We'll cancel every illegal Obama executive order. <APPLAUSE> By the way, a man that loves this state. It's his birthday today. Billy Graham, 98. <APPLAUSE> The father of Franklin. Billy Graham. What a great one, right? Ninety-eight years old. He is a fantastic man. Franklin's a fantastic man. And it's so wonderful to have support of people like that. We're going to protect <inaudible> religious liberty... <APPLAUSE> ... rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. We're going to take care of our veterans. <APPLAUSE> We will provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We move our education locally. <APPLAUSE> We will support the men and women -- these are great people, the men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We're going to save our Second Amendment. <APPLAUSE> And appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> This sounds so good to me because I started this on June 16th of last year because I couldn't stand when I looked at what was going on with our country, I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand it. Coming down the escalator, right, with Melania. Coming down that escalator June 16 of last year. And they were all saying -- there were all the dishonest pundits. Actually a few of them thought I had a hell of a chance if you want to know the -- the smarter ones. But they were all saying but he's not involved with -- I've been involved with politics all my life, on the other side. But I've been involved. We had 17 people -- by the way, one of the great people in here tonight, Mike Huckabee. Where is Mike Huckabee? <APPLAUSE> He's such -- is he here someplace? He is here. He is so great. Mike, wherever you are, come on out because you are great. I just saw him. But we had 17 people of great talent. Ben Carson endorsed us. Mike... <APPLAUSE> Mike endorsed us. Tremendous -- I mean very talented people. And one by one by one -- and they used to say -- well I remember we were down to like 13 or 14. In one state I got 49 percent. And one of these clowns said ""he has not reached the 50 percent mark."" I got 49 percent with like 14 people. How do you get 49 percent with 14 people? And they said he hasn't reached the 50 percent mark. They're very dishonest people. So we ended up with 17 people, right? Don't forget that's hard because nobody else ever had a field that big or that violent, or that violent. And we have a couple that didn't endorse and that's too bad. You know they signed a pledge. They didn't honor it. But... <BOOING> But -- no. But for the most part... <BOOING> No. For the most part they were very honorable. But it was rough. They said it was the roughest primary every. I would say this is the roughest election. You know the NFL ratings are way down. You know why? Because everyone's watching this. It's actually tougher. It's actually tougher. <APPLAUSE> Everyone's watching. The NFL ratings are way down. A lot of people say it's because of this. So you had 17 people. You've came down -- but we've got -- and this is a tribute to everybody in this room. We got the highest number of voters in the history of the Republican primary system. <APPLAUSE> So well done. <APPLAUSE> That's a long time. You know, starting with Honest Abe Lincoln, right. That's a long time. I got more than Honest Abe. That's really the only thing I did better than Honest Abe. Honest Abe was pretty -- he was pretty good. <inaudible> So here's the beauty. You have one day until the election. And it's not even one day. It's a half a day. To make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true. You have one magnificent chance. And honestly, in four years it's over, folks. There has never been a movement like this. Even these dishonest people in the media say there has never -- Bill O'Reilly. He said it's the single greatest political phenomena that he's witnessed in his life. That's a pretty good statement. <APPLAUSE> But others have said it. Others have said it. Others have said it. And it's not going to happen again. It won't be able to happen again. Four years it'll never happen. So you got to get out there and you got to vote. Got to get out.
<AUDIENCE: Trump.>
<TRUMP:> Somebody said what you've done has never been done before. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. I said believe me, it matters. No, they said that. It'll be down in the history books. I said you know what? You may be right about that. But if we don't win I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy. Wow do I -- you need energy for this. The single greatest waste of time, energy and money. I have over $100 million. That's a lot of money that I don't take in from the special interests because I don't need it. That's nice. And we have the biggest Internet -- you know the small donors? The small donors are giving us money at record clips. I think we had $82 million and then we had close to $100 million. And it comes in. And I think the average was like $61 each. I love those people. Those are people that love this country. <APPLAUSE> And usually that's for the Democrats. You know in all fairness, that's usually for the Democrats to do that. But we're beating everybody. Nobody's seen anything like what we're doing. So we don't want to blow it. We don't want to waste it. Go vote. Go vote. Because believe me, if we don't win, all of us, honestly we've all wasted our time, I'll be honest. Because nothing's going to happen. They may say good things about us as a movement. Won't mean a damn thing, folks. You got to go out. We got to vote and we got to win. Change. <APPLAUSE> Change. So you have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system that you're witnessing today, and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in this nation. Do not let this opportunity slip away. We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. <APPLAUSE> And we're fighting, we're fighting to bring us all together as Americans. We're a very divided country. People don't realize we are an unbelievably divided country. We're going to come together. Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. <APPLAUSE> Just imagine. I'm asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life. <APPLAUSE> Because if we win tomorrow, we will be able to make America wealthy again, to make America strong again, to make America safe again, and to make America great again.
<AUDIENCE: Great again.>
<TRUMP:> God bless you, everybody. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. God bless you. Thank you, North Carolina. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, folks. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<(JOINED IN PROGRESS)>
<TRUMP:> In one day, we are going to win the great state of Pennsylvania and we are going to take back the White House. <APPLAUSE> This election will decide whether we're ruled by a corrupt political class or whether we are ruled by yourselves, the people. It is time to reject a failed political elite that has bled this country dry. <APPLAUSE> To all the people of Pennsylvania, I say, we are going to put the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers back to work. We're bringing our companies back. <APPLAUSE> The trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the country. I want to take this moment to share a message with all of the Democratic voters in our country, thirsting -- thirsting for change. You're tired of a government that works only for Wall Street and the special interests. You're tired of the reckless foreign policy. The crazy wars that are never won. Hillary Clinton is the last stand for the Wall Street and special interest donors and to special interests themselves. And Hillary is the face of failure -- she's the face of failure. She's the face of failed foreign policy. <APPLAUSE> Real change begins -- she is indeed the face of failure. Look at what she's done with e-mails, look at the mess -- look at the mess, and look at the corruption. Real change begins immediately with the repealing and replacing of the disaster known as Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> This is a great room. We had great victories in this room by the way. <APPLAUSE> Great victories in this room. <APPLAUSE> And I went to school in Pennsylvania. And my kids went to school in Pennsylvania. So, I guess we assume it's a good place to learn. Look, have you been seeing the polls by the way?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> Oh, boy. Oh, boy. See the dishonest people back there, the media. The totally dishonest group. <BOOING> They are so dishonest.
<AUDIENCE: CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!>
<TRUMP:> They are so dishonest folks. You can't even read articles in certain papers anymore. New York Times is a total <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> We're doing fantastically well in North Carolina, I think we're leading. We -- I believe -- are leading in Florida. <APPLAUSE> And now, Hillary just announced she's going to additional stops. She's going to Michigan, traditionally not really a Republican state. But you know, I've been talking, I was man of the year in Michigan a number of years ago. And I started telling and talking about your car business is being stolen from you. I've been saying it for years and years and years. And you know what? Michigan now agrees. We're leading in Michigan -- we're leading. <APPLAUSE> And when I heard that crooked Hillary is going there tonight, she had to. Nobody thought in terms of Michigan. When I heard I figured, you know what? I have nothing to do tonight, so I'll go there tonight and give it the last word. OK? <APPLAUSE> So after this, I'm going to New Hampshire, and then I'm going to Michigan. Oh, we're going to have a great victory tomorrow folks, we're going to have a great victory. <APPLAUSE> They have no idea -- the dishonest media has no idea. Actually, they do have an idea. They're saying, what is going on? And look at these people and look at this enthusiasm, there's nothing like it. By the way, and just I have to say, this is considered -- the history of this country. This is actually -- and you've been hearing it. This is considered the greatest movement, nobody's ever seen anything like this folks. <APPLAUSE> Nobody's ever seen anything like <inaudible> where we give $150 billion to Iran. Where we give them $400 million in cash, but that turns out to be $1.7 billion in cash to Iran, for hostages. <BOOING> For hostages, which our president lied about. And just one other thing, why <inaudible> he ought to be working on jobs, on getting rid of ISIS, on our borders, on our healthcare which is failing so badly. <APPLAUSE> Boy oh boy. And she can't get anybody to go to her rallies, so she gets Jay-Z. <BOOING> He uses the worst language I have ever heard. And by the time he's finished, what's happened? What happens, he and Beyonce right? They're finished, by that time most of the people have left. So she thinks she's getting people, by the time she speaks they're all gone anyways. She should just take a small room and talk, -- just take a small room and talk. It's just been announced that the residents of Pennsylvania are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. So high that I won't tell you what it is, it's very high. All 67 counties in Pennsylvania, most of which I won in the primaries, right? <APPLAUSE> Almost all, almost everyone of them. Are losing Obamacare insurance next year, that puts you in a bad position. But the truth is, it's not going to matter. Because we are going to repeal it and replace it -- not going to matter, don't worry about it. <APPLAUSE> So you can leave here happy. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting, and deductibles are going through the roof. Yet, crooked Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive than it is right now. <BOOING> I'm asking for your vote, so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Pennsylvania. <APPLAUSE> Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. She's threatened national security <inaudible> and then to cover her tracks, she deleted 33,000 e-mails after receiving a Congressional subpoena.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!>
<TRUMP:> She should not <inaudible> she's being protected by a rigged system. And part of the rigged system is the dishonest media, believe me. They're rigging the system. <BOOING> True, it's true. Don't worry, they never show the crowds folks, they never -- they show my face, boom boom -- never show the crowd. It took over a year for the FBI to review 50,000 e-mails and then just eight days they reviewed 650,000 e-mails? <BOOING> So now, it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box tomorrow. You've got to get out and vote. <APPLAUSE> Let's swamp them. Pennsylvania, let's swamp them. You've got to get out. <APPLAUSE> Our country has never, ever done anything like they're doing right now when it comes to justice. James Cartwright, four star general, two weeks ago, admitted to one mistake. And he did it on the basis of national security he said, and I can understand that. He may go to jail for up to five years. General Petraeus's life has been destroyed for doing one, one hundredth of what Hillary Clinton did. <BOOING> So sad, so sad. It's -- honestly it's a disgrace. And now she's allowed to run for President. And General Cartwright will end up being in jail. <BOOING> My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take back our country from the special interests and the donor. <APPLAUSE> I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words from all of us. When we win tomorrow we are going to Washington, D.C. to drain the swamp. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> They say we're tied in Pennsylvania, I don't think so -- I don't think so. I think we're going to blow them out tomorrow in a lot of different ways, blow them out. <APPLAUSE> No way. This is not the sound of a second place finisher, that I can tell you. <BOOING> No, they have us tied. Don't forget we were 12 points down three weeks ago. And then after the debates, all of a sudden we started going up. We started going up and it was great. And now they have us even. But I actually think we're much better than that in Pennsylvania, I do -- and so do you. <APPLAUSE> Get out there <inaudible> contract, is my plan to bring back our jobs. <APPLAUSE> Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of it's manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. A deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by his lovely wife, Hillary Clinton. <BOOING> America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. <BOOING> We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America. And we will stop the jobs finally from leaving Pennsylvania. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> simply -- and you haven't heard this. Very simply, if a company wants to fire their workers, leave Pennsylvania, and move to <inaudible> like Mexico, and then ship their products back into the United States. We will make them pay a 35 percent tax on those products. <APPLAUSE> And you know what's going to happen? They're not going to leave. And if they do, that's OK. The country will make a lot of money. But they're not going to leave -- they're not going to leave. Now, your politicians could have thought of that, some of them, some of them can't, for they have other problems. We will renegotiate NAFTA, one of the worst deals, probably the -- not probably -- the single worst trade deal ever made in the history of this world, it's true. We'll stand up to China, and stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Hillary Clinton wants. You know, she called it the gold standard and then she lied during the debate. And she said, I never said that, I said, yes you did, you called it the gold standard. Turned out she was lying -- turned out. Of course you could look at it differently. It is the gold standard for the other side, not for the United States, for the other side it's good. How about this -- how about this? How about getting the questions for the debate? <BOOING> They fed her -- illegally, they fed her the questions for the debate, Donna Brazile. They fed her the questions to the debate. And she never came and...
<AUDIENCE: CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!>
<TRUMP:> They fed her the questions to the debate. And she didn't say, I can't do this, I'm sorry, it's so unethical. Can you imagine if I was given the questions to the debate? What would have happened? The biggest story all over the -- you don't even read this. You read a little bit about Donna Brazile, but you don't read this. They gave her the questions to debates, numerous debates against Bernie Sanders. And Bernie Sanders, he is really upset, I would bet you he would wish that he didn't give her that little nod, because he made a deal with the devil, you know it. He ruined the legacy -- he really had a very important legacy going folks. He ruined his legacy when he did that. And he's got to be very embarrassed -- he's got to be very, very embarrassed. As part of our plan to bring <inaudible> 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> And we will massively cut taxes for the middle class, the forgotten people -- the forgotten men and women of this country, who built our country. We will massively lower taxes. It's in our plan. And I'll tell you. Hillary, you see her plan. She is going to raise taxes substantially folks. <BOOING> We're the highest taxed nation in the world. She's going to raise taxes. Figure that one out. We will lift the restrictions on American energy <inaudible> and ban shale.... <BOOING> You folks can't be too happy about that I guess. We are going to unleash an energy revolution right here in Pennsylvania. We will cancel billions of dollars in global warming payments to the United Nations, billions and billions and billions. <APPLAUSE> And use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States. <APPLAUSE> And we will put our miners back to work and we will put our steel workers back to work -- they're going back to work. We will rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community, the Hispanic community, living in the inner city, have been treated very unfairly. Crime that is so bad, and I say it, you can't sometimes walk to a store, you get shot. Horrible <inaudible> Democrats have ruled the inner cities, unabated, unbroken. We are going to fix our inner cities. We're going to bring back jobs. We're going to bring back safety. We're going to bring education to the inner cities. And I say, because there's such unbelievable potential in terms of people within our inner cities. And I say, honestly folks, what do you have to lose? It's so bad now. What do you have to lose? I will fix it <inaudible> we are going to spend and we are going to bring those jobs back <inaudible> do you have to lose to the African-American community, and to the Hispanic community? <APPLAUSE> And by the way, take a look at what's happening in Florida and other places. The African-American community likes Donald Trump and they're not liking voting for Hillary Clinton very much. <APPLAUSE> They're not showing up, they don't want to vote for her. The Hispanic community, the numbers are becoming great. You know the Cubans, they gave me an award, Bay of Pigs award, last week. The entire Cuban community of Miami, Bay of Pigs Association. No, but a lot of trends are very disturbing to the media. <BOOING> And my numbers with the African-American community are -- I knew that was going to happen, I knew it. But we're going to fix the inner cities. We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation <inaudible> Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. <BOOING> Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. <APPLAUSE> Have not choice. <APPLAUSE> We have no choice. <APPLAUSE> A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a great wall. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!>
<TRUMP:> Are you ready? <APPLAUSE> And, who is going to pay for that wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> 100 percent correct, they will. They have -- unbelievable how they've done with our country. I was with the president of Mexico, three months ago -- terrific, it was a terrific meeting. But you know, when you have highways going into a country, it's got to be like a two way highway. Right now, they get all the jobs, they get all the factories and plants, they get all the income, they get all the money, the taxes. We get unemployment and we get drugs, we get nothing. <BOOING> We get nothing. That will all change folks. It will change very, very fast. And it will be -- it will be a two lane highway, maybe a one -- maybe one lane for a little while, but one way coming here -- but just for a little while. We have to catch up, this is a lot years. A lot of years we've been abused by people who don't know what they're doing. A lot of years, we've been abused by stupid politicians, very stupid politicians. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> supports totally open borders. There goes your country. And your plan gives your Social Security and Medicare benefits -- you know, she wants to give them to illegal immigrants. <BOOING> We're going to take care of our veterans folks -- we're going to take care of our veterans. <APPLAUSE> Hillary also strongly supports sanctuary cities like <inaudible> they come back, five years. They come back again, 10 years. Believe me, nobody's coming back. OK? <APPLAUSE> We will cancel all Federal funding to sanctuary cities. <APPLAUSE> We will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens, and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel corrupting our citizens <inaudible> have to do it. We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton Defense Sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military. <APPLAUSE> This will be a national effort. And it means a new future for Philadelphia's Navy shipyard. Right? <APPLAUSE> I know it well, I went to school in Philadelphia, I know it well. It's going to be activated again, really activated. I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients, and the list is growing. <APPLAUSE> The list is growing rapidly. And they told me on Mosul, the other night I was in Fort Bragg -- right near Fort Bragg. We had 25,000, 27,000 people in a field, it was unbelievable. And some of the generals and admirals came up to me -- we had a lot of them there. They said, Mr. Trump, you are so right on Mosul, you're so right. You know, I've been saying, the element of surprise. Four months ago, we say, our leaders, we are going to attack Mosul in <inaudible> Mosul in three months, we are going in. Because we are going to get the leaders of ISIS who are in Mosul. Well you have to understand, they've already left when you said the four months right? <inaudible> we will be going into Mosul in one week, these people are so stupid. The element of surprise. The great General Douglas McArthur, right? Spinning -- spinning in his grave. The great General George Patton, can you imagine what they must be? Let's assume they could actually see what's happening -- maybe they are? Can you imagine what they must be thinking? These were great warriors, great <inaudible> what we're going to do, when we going to be there, where we're going to enter. <LAUGHTER> Oh boy folks. We're gonna have such a different country -- you're going to be so proud of your country again. <APPLAUSE> Going to be so proud. <APPLAUSE> Wouldn't it be nice if nothing was said by our politicians and by Obama <inaudible> and then had a news conference a week later and said, total victory. They're having a very hard time right now. The leaders and the people have gone. And the other fighters are entrenched, and it's much more difficult than they thought, because of that. But the generals said, you are so right on that Mr. Trump, you're so right. Hillary and our failed establishment have dragged us into foreign wars that have made up less safe and never end -- they never end. Shipyard jobs <inaudible> borders wide open at home. That will all change when we win the presidential election. <APPLAUSE> Because from now on, it's going to be America first -- America first. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!>
<TRUMP:> Is everybody going to vote tomorrow?
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> Get your family, get your friends. No matter what you do, you've got to get out and vote. The whole world is laughing at us. They're laughing at what's going on in our country. When you look at trade, we don't win <inaudible> trade, trade, with the world, trade <inaudible> with a trade deficit with the world. With China, almost $500 billion trade deficit, who negotiates these deals? You know who negotiates them, political hacks. Political hacks dealing against the toughest, smartest people, that have been trained to, they've been trained to do nothing but this, they laugh at the stupidity of our country. But you know what? We have the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest business people in the world. We're going to use these great business people -- Carl Ichan endorsed me, so many others. We're going to use our great leaders, our great business people, it's time -- it's time. Think of it <inaudible> work, all this everything and we have a deficit, $800 billion. To all American's I say it's time for change, it's time for leadership. <APPLAUSE> In summing up, just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration, we are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, Hillary's going to raise your taxes. She's going to raise your taxes. We are going to protect your Social Security and Medicare, and you know what Hillary's going to do? You know what Hillary's going to do <inaudible> we will eliminate every unnecessary, job killing regulation, a <inaudible>. <APPLAUSE> We will rebuild our badly depleted military. And we are going to finally take care of our great veterans. <APPLAUSE> Provide school choice and put an end to common core, we're bringing education local. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> and women, these are great people, of law enforcement. <inaudible> and we will save our Second Amendment, which is under siege <inaudible> going to do big, big, bad numbers on your Second Amendment folks. <BOOING> And appoint justices to the United State Supreme Court, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> I can't believe I'm saying this. It started on June 16th, last year, June 16th. It's a long time -- thank you, I love you too darling. <APPLAUSE> <inaudible> all together as Americans, we're a divided nation -- we're a very badly divided nation. We're going to be brought together. Just imagine what our country could accomplish by working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. <APPLAUSE> Wouldn't it be nice? I'm asking you to dream big. <inaudible> vote. We are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life. You've got to go out and vote. Get everybody to vote. <APPLAUSE> It will be the greatest vote you've ever cast in your lifetime. Because together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And yes, we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody. Thank you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Get out and vote.

<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> First of all, we've made a great choice in picking Governor Mike Pence, didn't we? <APPLAUSE> Didn't we? <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you, Karen. What a group, Mike. This is big by any standard. Do you agree? This is -- look at it. <APPLAUSE> And here is the good news, there are thousands of people outside trying to get in. Do you believe what's going on? <APPLAUSE> So it all began for me in New Hampshire. It's the first state we won. <APPLAUSE> Remember the promise I made? We will stop those drugs from pouring in, poisoning your children, poisoning everyone else, and that we'll work very hard to get people off that addiction, it's going to happen. We're going to do it. I said I was going to do it, and we're going to do it. So I want to thank everybody in New Hampshire. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Also, my family was here. I said, come on. My children were here, and I just -- Tiffany, Jared, Ivanka. <APPLAUSE> Now, we know the Pence family, very, very famous. And by the way, I just looked at the numbers, Indiana is doing very well. You have done a great job. <APPLAUSE> A great job. Thank you. Thank you, Karen. Don Jr., Vanessa, Eric and Lara... <APPLAUSE> ... they've been such a big part. And you know, I've been reading about all these surrogates going all over for Hillary Clinton, but I had my family. I had the best surrogates of all, they were all over. <APPLAUSE> They were all over, so -- so I just want to thank you. Ivanka, maybe on behalf of the family say a couple of words? Go ahead. <APPLAUSE> I. 
<TRUMP:> Well, I was not planning on speaking tonight, but I did want to be here on this last night prior to Election Day to support my father. I am so incredibly proud of him, what he's accomplished today, and I know tomorrow will be another great day. And then he will get to the real work of making this country great, of working for you -- the American people. And he will never, ever let you down.

Thank you every much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! D. >
<TRUMP:> Well, you know, we said we want to finish you off in New Hampshire because of the incredible relationship I have, but who would have expected this, right? Who would have expected this? <APPLAUSE> This is some group. <APPLAUSE> So, a couple of things, two people I have a lot of respect for, really like as people, incredible people. And because they're so important to the area, I thought I would give you this information. They've told me I can do it, so I will do it. Tom Brady ... <APPLAUSE> ... great guy, great guy. Great guy, great friend of mine, great, great champion, unbelievable winner. He called today and he said, Donald, I support you, you're my friend, and I voted for you. <APPLAUSE> And I want to tell you, this guy is a champ, and he's a winner, and he is a great person. So I said, so, Tom, you voted for me, you support me, am I allowed to say it tonight to this massive crowd in New Hampshire? He said, if you want to say it, you can say it, OK? <APPLAUSE> Tom, that's what a champion is all about. And another person -- very close to Tom actually for a lot of reasons, you'll understand in a second, I have unbelievable respect for him, champion in every way. And I was in the plane and they handed me a letter, and it was from Coach Belichick. <APPLAUSE> And he wrote me the most beautiful letter and it was only two hours ago. So we called back, we said, do you think that Mr. Trump could read that letter to the people of New Hampshire? <APPLAUSE> And he said, absolutely if you'd like. He said, but do me a favor, don't read that letter. Let me send one that's a little bit different. So I think that he was going to take all the good things out, right, like most gutless people do -- gutless -- but he's the opposite, he's a champ. So he sent me the new letter and it was much better. It was stronger. <APPLAUSE> See, most people don't do that, most people do the opposite. I don't want to get involved. This guy is a true champ, so he writes, Coach Belichick, congratulations on a tremendous campaign. You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media, and have come out beautifully -- beautifully. <APPLAUSE> You proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter. Your leadership is amazing. I have always had tremendous respect for you, but the toughness and perseverance you have displayed over the past year is remarkable. Hopefully, tomorrow's election results will give the opportunity to make America great again."" <APPLAUSE> Best wishes for great results tomorrow. Bill Belichick. So I just want to... <APPLAUSE> ... I just want to -- it is funny though when he said I really want to redo the letter, I really did expect to get a little bit --- because I understand how most people work, but most people aren't the coach. So Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, I want to thank you both. <APPLAUSE> And go win a good Super Bowl or whatever you want to do. Boy, what a combination. Never been a better combination. But when you know them personally, like I do, they're even better. <APPLAUSE> Tomorrow we are going to win the great state of New Hampshire... <APPLAUSE> ... and we are going to take back the White House. <APPLAUSE> We are going to deliver historic once in a lifetime change. <APPLAUSE> When the people of this country from Florida to Minnesota, from New Mexico to right here in New Hampshire, step onto the voting booth, tomorrow, there is one fundamental question for you to consider -- do you want America to be ruled by the corrupt political class or do you want America to be ruled again by the people? <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! D. >
<TRUMP:> I am asking for the votes of all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independent, first-time voters -- and there are a lot of those first-time voters, folks. <APPLAUSE> Who are so desperately in need of change. <APPLAUSE> Can you imagine having Hillary Clinton for four years? <BOOING> Can you imagine? Hillary Clinton's only allegiance, is to herself, her donors and her special interests. <BOOING> My only special interest is to you, believe me, is to you. <APPLAUSE> That's why I'm doing this -- that's why I'm doing this. The corrupt special interest have stolen your jobs and shipped your wealth to other countries. They betrayed the working class of this country. Tomorrow, the American working class will strike back. It's about time. <APPLAUSE> Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> It's just been announced that Americans nationwide are going to experience a massive double-digit and triple-digit premium hike. Over 90 percent of the counties in New Hampshire are losing Obamacare insurers next year, lots of luck in your negotiation. Honestly folks, not going to matter, we're going to have it terminated. We're going to have great health care at a fraction of the cost, so it's not going to matter. <APPLAUSE> I want you to leave here happy tonight. <APPLAUSE> Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof. Yet, Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in New Hampshire and in our country. <APPLAUSE> Real change also means restoring honesty to government. Let's start by getting rid of Clinton. <APPLAUSE> That's the best.
<AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! D. >
<TRUMP:> By the way, did you ever see anything like happening right now? Have we ever seen anything like this? <BOOING> Four-star General James Cartwright, two weeks ago, for a tiny, tiny infraction by comparison, can go to jail for up to five years and might very well. General Petraeus' life was destroyed, reputation totally destroyed for something that was a fraction of what Hillary Clinton did. What a shame, what a shame, so sad. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. <APPLAUSE> She threatened national security, she sold her office to the highest bidder, and then to cover he tracks, she deleted 33,000 e- mails after receiving a congressional subpoena. <BOOING> That in itself disqualifies her from running from president. She shouldn't be allowed to run. She's being protected by a totally rigged system. <APPLAUSE> I've been saying it for a long time.
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! D. >
<TRUMP:> Drain the swamp. Hillary has shown contempt for the working people of this country. Her campaign in WikiLeaks has spoken horribly about Catholics and evangelicals and so many others. <BOOING> They got it all down folks, WikiLeaks -- WikiLeaks. And what Podesta said about her, bad instincts. He said she's got bad instincts, and Bernie said to her -- said bad judgment, right? So do we want a president with bad instincts and bad judgment?
<AUDIENCE: No! D. >
<TRUMP:> I don't think so. We're going to stand up for the Catholics and we're going to stand up for the evangelicals. <APPLAUSE> WikiLeaks just released another debate question -- Hillary got another one just one hour ago. I said I have to mention it. You know, if you go to West Point or Annapolis or the Air Force Academy, and if you get the questions to a test and if you don't report yourself, they throw you out. Sad, sad. To me it's one of the bad things. A lot of my people they say, let's not talk about that, I should talk about it. Donna Brazile got the questions. Donna Brazile took those questions and gave them to crooked Hillary, right? And crooked Hillary didn't do anything. She took the question. And I'll tell you what, if I were Bernie Sanders, I wouldn't be too happy, and she probably did it with me, too, but did we win those debates or what? <APPLAUSE> Wouldn't matter -- wouldn't matter. So she got those questions. She never turned them in, folks. Remember, you're dealing with a very dishonest person. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interest. <APPLAUSE> I want the entire corrupt Washington establish to hear these words from all of us. When we win tomorrow, we are going to drain the swamp. <APPLAUSE> That is something -- that is something. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring our jobs back. <APPLAUSE> New Hampshire has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a disaster, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by his lovely wife, Hillary. <BOOING> Amazingly, America has lost -- listen to this -- 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. <BOOING> We are living through the single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world -- there's never been anything like this. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving New Hampshire, believe me. <APPLAUSE> We will stop those jobs. If a company wants to fire their workers, leave New Hampshire and move to another country and then ship their products back into the United States through what will soon be a very, very strong and powerful border. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! D. >
<TRUMP:> We will make them pay a 35 percent tax on those products. And you know what's going to happen, you know what's going to happen? They're never leaving, they're staying -- they're staying. We will renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China and stop the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. <APPLAUSE> As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> We will massively cut taxes for the middle class. Hillary Clinton is raising taxes very substantially. <BOOING> We will cancel billions in global warning payments to the United Nations, billions and billions and billions of dollars and nobody knows where it goes and nobody knows what it's used for. I know where it goes, it goes into a lot of people's pockets. That's where it goes. <BOOING> And we will use that money to invest in environmental infrastructure in the United States of America if you don't mind, right? <APPLAUSE> And we will rebuild our inner cities, and the African-American community and the Hispanic community... <APPLAUSE> ... will love what's going to happen because the inner cities, in so many cases, are like living in hell. Crime is rampant, horrible. You can't walk to a store without getting shot. Schools are terrible, as bad as it gets, and there are no jobs. We're going to bring back the jobs. We're going to fix the schools and make them terrific. <APPLAUSE> And we're going to make the inner city safe. We're going to make them safe. And as you know, the Democrats, for longer than 100 years in many cases, unbroken chain have been in-charge of the inner cities. And you know what they want, they want your vote, then they say, see you in four years, folks. They do nothing. I will fix the inner cities. And I ask you though what do you have to lose? Believe me, we will do such a great job, what do you have to lose? And we've been doing very well. If you look down in Florida, look at those long lines. We have been doing very well with the African-American community and with the Hispanic community... <APPLAUSE> ... and all of the dishonest press, they're saying, what's going on here? What's going on? Among the world's most dishonest people -- look at all of them, look at all those cameras. <BOOING> Look at all of them, look at all of those cameras. Why don't you twirl the cameras, folks? Go ahead, twirl them. Show the crowd. <APPLAUSE> Show the crowd. They don't do it. And outside you have another 10,000 who was just reported -- 10,000. These are the world's bad people, they're dishonest people. They're very, very dishonest -- not all of them. But I would say most of them, you know. You heard -- you heard the coach, he mentioned it, too. I guess, he's got his difficulties with them also. Now they're very dishonest. I will be a champion for all Americans against this unfair and corrupt system. We will become a rich nation again. <APPLAUSE> But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States. <BOOING> Can't do it, folks -- can't do it. Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program ... <APPLAUSE> ... and we will keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country, believe me. <APPLAUSE> A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States and, yes, we will build a great, great wall. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! D. >
<TRUMP:> And don't forget, New Hampshire, I promised you -- I promised you, when I won New Hampshire in the primary, I promised you, I said, we are going to stop the drugs from flowing in -- we're going to stop them from flowing in. <APPLAUSE> We're going to stop the drugs from poisoning your children and plenty of others. We're going to build a wall. I was endorsed by so many people having to do with the borders, the Border Patrol agents, ICE all endorsed Donald Trump, such an honor for me because these are great people that want to do their job. But I promised you, that if I got this far, you were the first ones and you were the first ones that really taught me how bad the drug epidemic is. I met with your police -- who are incredible people, by the way -- and they explained... <APPLAUSE> And I guess, it made a big impact on me because I love New Hampshire, I love the beauty of New Hampshire -- the trees, the winding roads, the lakes, the rivers, the whole thing, the little streams. So I meet with people and I say, what's your biggest problem, and they'd say, heroin. I'd say, heroin? It made such an impact because it just doesn't seem to work with the beauty of your area. But I said we would stop it, we will stop it 100 percent and then we are going to work on helping the people who are so seriously addicted, OK? <APPLAUSE> We are going to do it. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton totally supports open borders, there goes your country. <BOOING> Which means unlimited drugs pouring into your states, pouring in to our country. Hillary also strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco... <BOOING> ... where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant and deported probably more than five times. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities, believe me <APPLAUSE> All of it. We will stop illegal immigration, stop the drugs from pouring into our country and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens. <APPLAUSE> We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and re- build our badly depleted military we needed so badly now. <APPLAUSE> This will be national effort. And a major part of this re- building will be the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. <APPLAUSE> It's going to be a big part of it, folks, a big part. We have now the smallest Navy, by the way -- does anyone know this? The smallest Navy that we've had since World War I. <BOOING> We're going to build it back up. I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients, and the list goes on and on, and up and up every day. <APPLAUSE> Hillary and her failed establishment have dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe and that we never win -- we never win. We fight and fight and fight. Like Mosul, we give them four months notice, we're going into Mosul. What about the element of surprise? Remember the old element of surprise. We are going to be attacking Mosul in four months. We will hit them from the rear, we will hit them from the front, we will paratroop in, we will do all sorts of things. Then three months, they say again, then two months, then one month, and a couple of weeks ago I'm hearing, we expect to be attacking Mosul next week. These are smart people. One of the reasons we're attacked is we want to get the leaders of ISIS who we feel are staying in Mosul. They left after the first mention that we're going to attack. Don't these people understand it? What a bunch of people we have. <APPLAUSE> What a bunch of people. I mean, we got a president, all he wants to do is campaign for crooked Hillary. That's all he wants to do. <BOOING> You know, he takes that big -- that big 747 Air Force One, those big old engines that spew the stuff, right? And he flies it all over the place, campaigning for Hillary. And then he talks about let's not affect the ozone layer. What a joke -- what a joke. And he shouldn't be campaigning, he should be out trying to get our jobs back, trying to secure our borders, building up our military, stopping our drug problem. <APPLAUSE> Amazing, amazing. And Hillary can't fill a room. Look at this is called, filling a stadium, and I have no guitar and no piano, right? I mean, she gets Jay-Z and Beyonce the other night. <BOOING> The language, right, the language was so bad. People were insulted; they started walking out. Hillary then walks under the stage, hugs them, hugs them, hugs them, and then she says, Donald Trump uses such foul language. Give me a break. <BOOING> Did you hear what he was saying? And tonight she has Bruce Springsteen. What they don't say is this, so they perform actually in the case of Jay-Z, they were leaving because some of these people never heard language like that, they started to leave. So what happens, they come in, listen to the musician, which I think is demeaning to the -- it's actually demeaning to the political process. They listen -- because she can't fill a room. If she'd come her she'd have -- I'm telling you -- she'd have 100 people sitting on the first place. We're going to have -- we have 28,000 people including the people outside... <APPLAUSE> ... more than Beyonce, more than Jay-Z, more than anybody. <APPLAUSE> And we don't have a guitar. What we do have is we all have together a great plan to make America great again. That's what we have. <APPLAUSE> And also in all fairness, is there any place better than a Trump rally to be? I mean, really? <APPLAUSE> There's no place better. So these politicians have shipped our jobs and our wealth all over the world and left our borders wide open at home. That will change immediately upon our victory, believe me, immediately. <APPLAUSE> Got to get out and vote. Tomorrow is the day. Got to get out -- we got to get out and vote. One thing I'll say about New Hampshire, I'd never disappointed New Hampshire, but New Hampshire has never disappointed me. <APPLAUSE> Remember in the primaries they said, Donald Trump, you know the phony polls, these people. <BOOING> They said, Donald Trump may not win New Hampshire. I said, that's surprising, I think I'm going to win -- I think I'm going to win. And then we won by 18 points... <APPLAUSE> ... with a lot of people. You know, we have 17 people. You know what else? Right next door in Massachusetts where they're represented... <APPLAUSE> Now I know why you like Belichick so much and Tom -- Tom Brady. By the way, is there a better reference than Tom Brady and Bill Belichick who are... <APPLAUSE> I don't know -- I don't think so. You know, in Massachusetts we had -- what 14 people left. They go like this, boom, boom, boom. I think we had 14 people left. We got 49 and-a-half percent of the vote, and these dishonest pundits said, Donald Trump has not broken 50. How do you break 50 when you have 14 people? <LAUGHTER> But we won -- we won Massachusetts, we got over 49 percent. <APPLAUSE> And Massachusetts is represented by Pocahontas, right? Pocahontas. <BOOING> Represented by Pocahontas. Oh, she's terrible. She is so -- she is just a terrible person, terrible. You know, Clinton thinks she is doing herself a favor to use this woman as a surrogate. Everybody that watches her, they say, she is a terrible human being, she is terrible. <APPLAUSE> So, I don't know who's going to challenge her, but whoever does, you know, I hear a very great baseball pitcher is going to challenge her. <APPLAUSE> He's a great -- and you know what, he's a great guy. I don't know if he's going to do it, but he's a great guy. But Elizabeth Warren is terrible -- and you know what, she's a terrible -- let me tell you, she's a terrible senator. Take a look at what she's passed, nothing, nothing. And in the Senate, everybody hates her. They don't want to even deal with her. So I'll make you a deal. You can have Pocahontas, I'll take Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, OK? <APPLAUSE> And from now on, it's going to be America first. <APPLAUSE> To all Americans I say it's time for change and time for leadership. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan, even bigger, and Hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We will cancel every illegal Obama executive order just... <APPLAUSE> He goes out and plays golf so much that he doesn't have time to convince Congress to go -- let's do it the way it's supposed to be done, right? Right? I mean, he's played more golf than most people in the PGA Tour. <LAUGHTER> This guy like is it over 300 rounds. Hey, look, it's good. Golf is fine, but always play with leaders of countries and people that can help us, don't play with your friends all the time. We are going to protect religious liberty... <APPLAUSE> ... re-build our military, and we are going to finally take care of our veterans properly, our veterans properly. <APPLAUSE> Our veterans have been very mistreated, and I want to thank them for the tremendous support -- and the military -- the tremendous support I get. They do polls and it's like, forget it. It's like I'm not running against anybody. And our law enforcement has been so great. <APPLAUSE> They've been great. We're going to provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We're bringing our education locally. <APPLAUSE> And we will support the men and women of law enforcement, great people. <APPLAUSE> ... and save our Second Amendment, which is under siege... <APPLAUSE> ... and appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> Think of this, I started on June 16th, long time ago from way back. Can you imagine this? And now I can say you have one day, but it's no longer one day, it's like just like tomorrow morning. Who is going to vote tomorrow morning, please? <APPLAUSE> I promise you this, I will never ever let you down, I promise you that. <APPLAUSE> I didn't need to do this. You know, I built a great company, one of the great companies, great, great -- some of the great real estate assets in the world. I enjoyed my life, and I was on the other side, you know, I'm criticizing the other side because I understand the other side as well as anybody. But our country was in trouble and I love our country, and I looked at what was happening. <APPLAUSE> And I'm really happy I did this -- I'm really happy I did this. It's been an amazing experience, and we are indeed going to make our country great again. You have one day to make every dream, your every dream for your country and your family come true. You have one magnificent chance to beat this corrupt system and deliver justice for every forgotten man, for every forgotten woman, and for every forgotten child in this nation. <APPLAUSE> Do not let this opportunity slip away, folks. It's never going to happen again, never going to happen. In four years from now, never going to happen again. And people are voting that they never saw before, these are great people, but they never saw anybody they wanted. They're voting in numbers like they've never seen in Texas, in Florida. No matter where you look, they're voting in number like they've never seen before. We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. <APPLAUSE> And we are fighting to bring us all together as Americans, just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! D. >
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Such a great honor, incredible people. You're incredible people. I'm asking you to dream big, because with your vote, we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. <APPLAUSE> To all of the people in all of our cities and towns, I say these words to you tonight, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. <APPLAUSE> I will win for you. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless you. <APPLAUSE> Get out and vote. Thank you, everybody.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-08"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody. Wow. Thank you. <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. So, you know, we added this stop about 12 minutes ago, and look at this place. Is this incredible? <APPLAUSE> And we don't need -- we don't need Jay-Z or Beyonce. We don't need Jon Bon Jovi. We don't need Lady Gaga. All we need is great ideas to make America great again. That's all we need. <APPLAUSE> So, it's now officially Tuesday, November 8th. <APPLAUSE> Did you ever think you'd be hearing a major speech like at around close to 1 o'clock in the morning? Are we crazy? Is this crazy? <APPLAUSE> It's crazy. <APPLAUSE> But you know, we just left New Hampshire, where we're doing fantastically well. We're up in New Hampshire. We're up in Ohio. <APPLAUSE> We're up in Iowa. We're up in North Carolina. We're doing great there. <APPLAUSE> We're up in Florida. <APPLAUSE> We're doing really, really well in Pennsylvania. I mean, we are doing well. These people, the world's most dishonest people, the media, they are not happy. No, no. <BOOING> They're not happy. They're saying, ""What's going on?"" Today, we're going to win the great state of Michigan and we are going to win back the White House. <APPLAUSE> We're hours away from a once-in-a-lifetime change. We're going to have real change, not Obama change. I want to begin tonight by thanking all of you and all of the people in this incredible movement. You know, it's a movement like has never happened in this country before. It's a movement that nobody's ever seen before, even these people. They talk about it. It's one of the great political phenomenas, many of them have said it, even some of them who truly, truly dislike me. They've said this is one of the great phenomenas. I mean, look at this place at almost one o'clock in the morning. <APPLAUSE> So, I love Michigan. And I was the man of the year or something like four or five years ago. And I came here, and I have so many friends in Michigan. But I came here to get the award. They asked me to make a speech. I made a speech, and I talked about how Michigan, they're ripping your auto companies apart. They're taking your jobs. They're closing your plants. And they're moving them to Mexico and other places, but mostly to Mexico in this case. And I talked about that. And everybody liked me in Michigan. I said, ""But, you know, we have to do something about it."" But I wasn't a politician. But I talked about it, and I kept talking about it and talking about it and talking. And then I see Ford moving a big plant, and then Ford just two weeks ago announcing their small cars are going to be produced and made entirely in Mexico. <BOOING> And it's getting worse and worse. And I developed a great relationship with the people of Michigan. So the reason I'm here is that I thought New Hampshire was going to be my last speech. And I heard that crooked Hillary Clinton was coming to Michigan. I said, ""Let's follow it up; let's follow it up."" <APPLAUSE> And I said there's no place I'd rather be for my last rally, right here in Michigan, late at night. <APPLAUSE> And full of energy and life. Boy, do we have energy and life. Wow. <APPLAUSE> Although this is our last rally of this campaign, it's almost hard to believe. We started a year-and-a-half ago. We started with 17 very talented people -- governors, senators, Dr. Ben Carson -- great guy; a lot of talented people. <APPLAUSE> And one by one by one, and most of them have been terrific and give us great support. Ben Carson is one of them, as you know. But -- but who would have thought -- and now we have one flawed candidate left to beat -- one flawed candidate. <APPLAUSE> It's going to be the very beginning of a new adventure, because the new adventure we have to win. We have to go out and vote. But the new adventure is making America great again. We're going to do it. After we win, I'm going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant. And we will do it. And we'll do a lot of expansion. We're going to do a lot of expansion. I know exactly what to do, folks. We're not going to lose your jobs anymore. We're not going to lose your jobs anymore. <APPLAUSE> We are going to bring back the automobile industry to Michigan -- bigger and better and stronger than ever before. You've been mistreated. <APPLAUSE> Michigan now stands at the crossroads of history. If we win Michigan, we will win this historic election and then we truly will be able to do all of the things we want to do. They won't be taking our jobs any longer. They won't be doing the things they've been doing to us. We'll end up having great health care, strong borders. We'll build up our military. We have no choice. We have a depleted military. We'll be able to do the things we want to do. When you step into that voting booth today -- it's now today. <APPLAUSE> There is one core question for you to consider. Do you want America to be ruled by the corrupt political class?
<AUDIENCE: No!>
<TRUMP:> Or do you want America to be ruled by you, the people? That's what it is -- by the people. <APPLAUSE> The way it was supposed to have been for a long time. We've lost track. And for Michigan, we will bring back your automobile production and we will bring back your industry. Wait until you see what we do for Michigan. I've been talking about it for a long time. Crooked Hillary has not talked about it, folks. She doesn't know where to begin. She talked about bringing industry back to New York state when she was a New York state senator. Let me tell you, not only didn't it come back, look at up-state New York. It's a disaster. It got worse. People fled. Companies fled. It's a disaster. The corrupt politicians and their special interests have ruled over this country for a very long time. Today is our independence day. <APPLAUSE> Today, the American working class is going to strike back finally. <APPLAUSE> Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as Obamacare. <APPLAUSE> It has just been announced that the residents of Michigan are going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike, like you wouldn't believe. It's not going to matter that much, honestly, because we're going to terminate it. You're not going to have to worry about it. OK? Don't worry. <APPLAUSE> Now, on the other hand, if something horrible happens tomorrow, get ready to pay a lot more than you're even paying now. But that's not going to happen. I'm looking at that fantastic young lady right there. She's shaking her head -- ""No way, no way."" Not going to happen, right? <APPLAUSE> Good. Not going to happen. Nah, I don't think you're going to have to worry about the premiums. But with Obamacare, premiums are surging. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting. And deductibles are going right through the roof. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. And it doesn't work. It's no good. I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Michigan and throughout the United States of America. We have to do it. <APPLAUSE> We don't have a choice. Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. So the first thing we should do, let's get rid of Hillary. Okay? That's probably the... <APPLAUSE> That would be a very good first step. That's a good first step. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. <APPLAUSE> She is being protected by a totally rigged system that I've been talking about for a long time. It's a rigged system. Now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box. And I don't have to say do it tomorrow, do it in a week. You're going to do it today. You'll go to sleep for a couple of hours, right? <APPLAUSE> Go to sleep. You go to sleep for a couple of hours. You wake up. You cast your vote, then you can go back to sleep or go to work. You people won't go to sleep. You'll go back to work. I know my people. You'll get up after about two hours. You'll vote. And you'll go to work. <APPLAUSE> I know my Michigan people. I know. I have so many friends here. They work. They don't stop. We are finally going to close the history books on the Clintons and their lies and schemes and corruption. <APPLAUSE> We will open a bright new chapter focused on you, the American people. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear our words, our words when we say -- you know what we're going to say? We're going to win today and we're going to Washington, D.C. to drain the swamp. <APPLAUSE> Absolutely. Absolutely. <APPLAUSE> Oh, you probably heard me say it: drain the swamp.
<AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!>
<TRUMP:> Oh, this is beautiful. Isn't it too bad that the corrupt media never show the crowds? You know, it is like almost one in the morning and we have I think they said 18,000 people here. Every corner -- look at this. <APPLAUSE> Every corner. And you know what they'll say? ""Donald Trump is speaking before a crowd of people."" <LAUGHTER> These people are the worst. ""He's speaking in front of a few thousand people."" <APPLAUSE> At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. The trade policies of Hillary Clinton, from NAFTA to China to Korea to the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- which, by the way, is a disaster...
<AUDIENCE: Yes!>
<TRUMP:> ... have raided your factories, crushed your auto industry and gutted your communities. You know it. And she's not -- look folks, honestly, you couldn't give her a shot. You're wasting your time. You're wasting your time. <APPLAUSE> She's not going to be able to do the job. She's not going to be able to do the job. <BOOING> Just look at her record. But forget her record, not going to be able to do the job. She doesn't have a clue. Michigan has lost more than one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by his lovely wife, Hillary. Right? <BOOING> Right? <BOOING> By the way, you know who I spotted in the audience? Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. <APPLAUSE> Rudy Giuliani. <APPLAUSE> He's got energy, that guy. He's all over the place, going from place to place to place. Got a lot of energy. A lot of -- a lot of this up here too. <APPLAUSE> America has lost -- listen to this -- 70,000 factories, 70,000. Not 700, not 7,000, 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill- and Hillary-backed disaster. <BOOING> We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. There's never been anything like this. Our jobs are being stolen like candy from a baby. Not going to happen anymore, folks. There are going to be consequences. <APPLAUSE> There are going to be -- when they fire our people, our great people who have been working for 25, 30 years at these companies -- they fire our people, there are going to be consequences. It doesn't work that way, not anymore. And the politicians have been working on this problem for 15 years, for 20 years. And it's so simple to solve. Delphi laid off 3,627 workers and moved their jobs to Mexico and other countries. <BOOING> FTE Automotive laid of 166 workers in Auburn Hills, beautiful place, and moved their jobs to Mexico. <BOOING> Chrysler laid off 5,300 workers and moved their jobs to Mexico, China and to other countries. Ford laid off 2,155 workers and moved their jobs to Mexico and many other countries. <BOOING> Now Ford is moving all of its small car production of Mexico. Isn't that wonderful? It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the damn water in Flint. <APPLAUSE> What the hell? <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Yes.
<AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!>
<TRUMP:> Unbelievable. Say, is that true though, or what? Unbelievable. You know, I have a friend, he's the biggest in the world at building plants. That's what he does, he builds plants. You say, ""Build an apartment"" and he wouldn't know what to do. He builds plants, the biggest plants in the world; most sophisticated plants, all kinds of plants. I said, ""How are you doing?"" He's from this country. Loves this country, loves this whole area, loves you people. He wants to do them here. So I said to him, ""Let me ask you, how are you doing?"" He said, ""Unbelievable."" I said, ""Oh, that's good; that's good. Where are you doing well?"" ""Mexico."" I said, ""What about our country?"" ""Not so good,"" he said, ""Donald, you have to see what we're doing in Mexico. We're building some of the greatest plants anywhere in the world."" And I said, ""Isn't this sad, isn't this pathetic?"" We're going to change it around. I want Mexico to build great plants. But we need to build great plants also. It's got to be a two-way street, folks. <APPLAUSE> Got to be a two-way street. <APPLAUSE> And right now, it's a one-lane highway right into these other countries. They take our money. They take our jobs. They build their plants. They build their factories. We end up with unemployment and drugs. That's what we end up with. Not going to happen any longer. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Michigan. That I can tell you 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> If Ford or another company wants to fire their workers in Michigan and move to another country and ship their products back into the United States, I will pick up the phone myself if I -- because I love it -- they don't want me to do that, folks. I want to do it. It's so easy. I love doing it. It's like I'm a natural. But I'll have plenty of great representatives. But we -- we -- I'm going to do it every once in a while. I don't care, because I love it. We'll be calling the executives at Ford or whatever company it is, and we'll tell them very nicely that if they want to move their factory or their plant to another country, they will have to pay a 35 percent tax when they sell their cars or their product back into the United States through what will soon be a very, very powerful border. <APPLAUSE> So they'll pay a tax. And here's what's going to happen 100 percent. Nobody's moving, folks. They're not going to move. They're not going to move, OK? Just think of it. Don't worry about it. We'll build a wall. <APPLAUSE> Don't worry about it. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers and our companies -- 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> We will also immediately stop the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Hillary Clinton called the ""gold standard."" And she lied. Look, she lied. During the debate -- by the way, did Trump win the debate? Did Trump win the debate? <APPLAUSE> And by the way, he's here. Did Mike Pence win the debate? <APPLAUSE> Man, was that an easy -- it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy, but he certainly made it look easy, didn't he? How good is this guy? <APPLAUSE> Wow. Honestly, I felt so sorry for Tim Kaine. That was like -- that was like a great football team playing your local high school football players. So Hillary lied about it. She said it was the gold standard. And we caught her in the lie, and all of that. But when you think about it, it is the gold standard. It's the gold standard for the other countries, not for us -- for the other countries we're doing business with. Can't do it. Hillary will pass the TPP. She will absolutely pass it, which will destroy the rest of the auto industry. Believe me. It will -- just mark my words -- it will destroy. They don't even talk about currency manipulation in TPP. And they didn't want to, because it was taken out because some of our politicians wanted it taken out -- the number one weapon. They wanted it taken out because the special interests take care of our politicians, folks. But they're not taking care of me. I've spent a fortune on this campaign. And I'll tell you, I told this to Mike Pence. If we don't win -- because everyone is saying unbelievable, unbelievable; it doesn't matter if you win or lose; there's never been a movement like this. I said, ""Let me just tell you, stop right there. If we don't win, this will be the single greatest waste of time, energy and money in my life."" We have to win. To do what we have to do, we have to win. We can't just have something that looks wonderful in the history books in 30 years. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. <APPLAUSE> We will massively cut taxes for the middle class. Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes very significantly. <BOOING> Think of it. We're the highest-taxed nation in the world, and she wants to raise your taxes. And we will rebuild our inner cities. I know so much about Detroit. I know so much about the inner cities. The African American community, the Hispanic community has been treated horribly for a long time. The politicians and the case of the inner cities -- virtually all Democrats, for over 100 years sometimes a chain unbroken. What they've done is they come in and they get your vote, and then they say, ""See you -- four years, I'll see you in four years."" We're going to fix our inner cities. Right now, they're so unsafe. You walk to the store to pick up a loaf of bread, you get shot, you get shot. You know, in Chicago, thousands and thousands of shootings since January 1st. The inner cities are unbelievably dangerous. The education is no good, the safety is horrible, and there are no jobs. And I tell everybody, ""What the hell do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it."" We will fix it. <APPLAUSE> We will fix it. Vice President Mike Pence will be involved and he is so enthused about this. There is such potential. We have such potential in the -- the people, I'm talking about the people. There's such potential there. We will fix it, remember that. <APPLAUSE> We will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our country. <BOOING> And virtually unlimited immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world, including regions overrun and controlled by ISIS. Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. <APPLAUSE> And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country, 100 percent. <APPLAUSE> We have no choice. We have no choice. But we all have big hearts and we will build safe havens in Syria, and we'll get the Gulf States -- they have nothing but money. They have nothing but money. We will get them to pay for it. We owe $20 trillion right now. We're not going to pay for it. We're going to get the Gulf States to pay for it. We'll manage it. We'll take care of people, but they can't come into our country. We have enough problems, OK? <APPLAUSE> Here in Michigan, you've seen first-hand the problems caused with the refugee program, with large numbers of poorly vetted refugees pouring into your state without your knowledge, without your support, or without your approval. Nobody even knows where people are being placed. A Trump administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they're being placed. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States, and yes, we will build a great, great wall. <APPLAUSE>
<AUDIENCE: Build a wall! Build a wall! Build a wall!>
<TRUMP:> So, I just want to ask you one question, if you don't mind, at one in the morning: Who is going to pay for the wall?
<AUDIENCE: Mexico!>
<TRUMP:> A hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay. Now, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico, but right now it's a one-way street. We can't have that. We can't have that. They're going to build the wall. Hillary supports totally open borders. There goes your country -- and strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times. A Trump administration will end this nightmare of violence and end it quickly. We will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our wonderful citizens. We're going to do it, easily, quickly. <APPLAUSE> We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. <APPLAUSE> There haven't been many times where we need it more. I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients, and that list just grew a lot larger today. <APPLAUSE> Hillary Clinton and our failed establishment have dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, shipped our wealth overseas to other countries and left our borders at home totally wide open. That will change when we win the presidency. That will change, that will change. Has to change, it has to change. <APPLAUSE> From now on, it's going to be America first, America first. <APPLAUSE> And just in summing up, to all Americans I say, it is time for change. It is time for leadership. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the largest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. <APPLAUSE> And Hillary wants to raise your taxes. We will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation. We'll cancel every illegal Obama executive order. We will protect religious liberty. <APPLAUSE> And yesterday, it was Billy Graham's 98th birthday, meaning an hour ago. Yesterday, meaning an hour ago. But he's a great, great man and his son Franklin has been so amazing. But I wanted to mention Billy Graham, 98 years old, amazing. <APPLAUSE> We're going to rebuild our military and take care of our veterans who have not been taken care of properly. We are going to take care of our vets. <APPLAUSE> It's about time, believe me. It's about time. We're going to provide school choice and put an end to common core. We're bringing education local. <APPLAUSE> We will support the great men and women of law enforcement. <APPLAUSE> We will save our Second Amendment, which is under siege. <APPLAUSE> And appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. <APPLAUSE> The election is now. The election is now. Can you believe it? It's today. It's today. It's unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> You can make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country and your family come true. You have one magnificent chance to beat this corrupt, rigged system and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and forgotten woman and forgotten child in this nation. We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. <APPLAUSE> And we are fighting to bring us all together as Americans. We're living in a divided nation. We're living in a very divided nation. We're going to be brought together. Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag, right? <APPLAUSE> I'm asking you to dream big, because with your vote, we are just hours away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. <APPLAUSE> So to every parent who dreams for their child, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight. I am with you. I will fight for you. And I will win for you. I promise. <APPLAUSE> To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I pledge to you one more time, together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, everybody. Thank you. God bless you, everybody. Go to bed. Go to bed right now. Get up and vote. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Michigan. We love you. We'll be back. Let's win. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"

<date:""2016-11-09"">
<TRUMP:> Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. <APPLAUSE> Sorry to keep you waiting; complicated business; complicated. <APPLAUSE> Thank you very much. <APPLAUSE>
<TRUMP:> I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. <APPLAUSE> She congratulated us -- it's about us -- on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she -- she fought very hard. <APPLAUSE> Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. <APPLAUSE> I mean that very sincerely. <APPLAUSE> Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. <APPLAUSE> It's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. <APPLAUSE> For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people... <LAUGHTER> ... I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. <APPLAUSE> As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard- working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families. <APPLAUSE> It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will. <APPLAUSE> Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American Dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. <APPLAUSE> Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well -- tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. <APPLAUSE> We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. <APPLAUSE> They've been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. <APPLAUSE> We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. <APPLAUSE> We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.
<TRUMP:> Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. <APPLAUSE> We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone -- all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this what they are calling tonight very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. <APPLAUSE> Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And, where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert -- my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? <APPLAUSE> My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's OK. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred. Great guy. Fantastic guy. <APPLAUSE> Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters; great, unbelievable parents. To Melania and Don... <APPLAUSE> ... and Ivanka... <APPLAUSE> ... and Eric and Tiffany and Baron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. <APPLAUSE> This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara <ph>, unbelievable job, unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got -- we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been -- it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. <APPLAUSE> Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. That Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. <APPLAUSE> Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician, and let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get: Senator Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? <APPLAUSE> Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? <LAUGHTER> Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats: Dr. Ben Carson. Where is Ben? <APPLAUSE> Where is Ben?
<TRUMP:> And by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah -- thank you very much. General Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? <APPLAUSE> And General Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign. And they're special people and it's really an honor. We have 22 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. We have just tremendous people. A very special person who believed me and, you know, I'd read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is... <CROSSTALK>
<TRUMP:> That's right. How did you possibly guess? So let me tell you about Reince, and I've said this. I said, Reince -- and I know it, I know. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Reince is a superstar. But I said, ""They can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win,"" because you can't be called a superstar -- like Secretariat -- if Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful bronze bust at the track at Belmont. But I'll tell you, Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest-working guy. And in a certain way, I did this -- Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince. <APPLAUSE> Boy oh boy oh boy. It's about time you did this, Reince. My God. <APPLAUSE> Say a few words. No, come on, say something. RNC CHAIRMAN 
<REINCE PRIEBUS: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God.>
<TRUMP:> Amazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done. So I also have to say I've gotten to know some incredible people -- the Secret Service people. <APPLAUSE> They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp, and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell you. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down on the seat. But they are fantastic people, so I want to thank the Secret Service. <APPLAUSE> And law enforcement in New York City. They're here tonight. <APPLAUSE> These are spectacular people, sometimes under-appreciated unfortunately, but we appreciate them. We know what they go through. So, it's been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job. And I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. <APPLAUSE> I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years... <APPLAUSE> ... you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that -- you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do and I can... <CROSSTALK>
<TRUMP:> Thank you very much. And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. <APPLAUSE> We're going to get to work immediately for the American people. And we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You'll be so proud. Again, it's my honor. It was an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period. And I love this country. <APPLAUSE> Thank you. Thank you very much. <APPLAUSE> Thank you to Mike Pence. Thank you.","The Grammar Lab"
